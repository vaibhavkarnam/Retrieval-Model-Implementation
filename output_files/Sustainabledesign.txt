Sustainabledesign
 sustainable design  also called environmental design  environmentally sustainable design  environmentally conscious design  etc   is the philosophy of designing physical objects  the built environment  and services to comply with the principles of social  economic  and ecological sustainability  1   the intention of sustainable design is to  eliminate negative environmental impact completely through skillful  sensitive design   1  manifestations of sustainable design require renewable resources  impact the environment minimally  and connect people with the natural environment   great design is sustainable design  rather than considering green building design as an externality  architects must think about it as a set of principles for great design  this includes better user experience and comfort  doing more with less to enable the building to easily achieve peak performance  and maximizing the effectives of durable  quality materials  rather than the well-known edict \u201cform follows function  u201d it u2019s time to think \u201cform follows environment  u201d [2   beyond the  elimination of negative environmental impact   sustainable design must create projects that are meaningful innovations that can shift behaviour  a dynamic balance between economy and society  intended to generate long-term relationships between user and object service and finally to be respectful and mindful of the environmental and social differences  3   the principle that all directions of progress run out  ending with diminishing returns  is evident in the typical  s  curve of the technology life cycle and in the useful life of any system as discussed in industrial ecology and life cycle assessment  diminishing returns are the result of reaching natural limits  common business management practice is to read diminishing returns in any direction of effort as an indication of diminishing opportunity  the potential for accelerating decline and a signal to seek new opportunities elsewhere  citation needed   see also  law of diminishing returns  marginal utility and jevons paradox    a problem arises when the limits of a resource are hard to see  so increasing investment in response to diminishing returns may seem profitable as in the tragedy of the commons  but may lead to a collapse  this problem of increasing investment in diminishing resources has also been studied in relation to the causes of civilization collapse by joseph tainter among others  4  this natural error in investment policy contributed to the collapse of both the roman and mayan  among others  relieving over-stressed resources requires reducing pressure on them  not continually increasing it whether more efficiently or not  5   negative effects of waste  about 80 million tonnes of waste in total are generated in the u k  alone  for example  each year  6  and with reference to only household waste  between 1991/92 and 2007/08  each person in england generated an average of 1.35 pounds of waste per day  7   experience has now shown that there is no completely safe method of waste disposal  all forms of disposal have negative impacts on the environment  public health  and local economies  landfills have contaminated drinking water  garbage burned in incinerators has poisoned air  soil  and water  the majority of water treatment systems change the local ecology  attempts to control or manage wastes after they are produced fail to eliminate environmental impacts   the toxic components of household products pose serious health risks and aggravate the trash problem  in the u s   about eight pounds in every ton of household garbage contains toxic materials  such as heavy metals like nickel  lead  cadmium  and mercury from batteries  and organic compounds found in pesticides and consumer products  such as air freshener sprays  nail polish  cleaners  and other products  8  when burned or buried  toxic materials also pose a serious threat to public health and the environment   the only way to avoid environmental harm from waste is to prevent its generation  pollution prevention means changing the way activities are conducted and eliminating the source of the problem  it does not mean doing without  but doing differently  for example  preventing waste pollution from litter caused by disposable beverage containers does not mean doing without beverages  it just means using refillable bottles   waste prevention strategies in planning for facilities  a comprehensive design strategy is needed for preventing generation of solid waste  a good garbage prevention strategy would require that everything brought into a facility be recycled for reuse or recycled back into the environment through biodegradation  this would mean a greater reliance on natural materials or products that are compatible with the environment   any resource-related development is going to have two basic sources of solid waste \u2014 materials purchased and used by the facility and those brought into the facility by visitors  the following waste prevention strategies apply to both  although different approaches will be needed for implementation  9   while the practical application varies among disciplines   some common principles are as follows   a model of the new design principles necessary for sustainability is exemplified by the  bill of rights for the planet  or  hannover principles  - developed by william mcdonough architects for expo 2000 that was held in hannover  germany   these principles were adopted by the world congress of the international union of architects  uia  in june 1993 at the american institute of architects   aia  expo 93 in chicago  further  the aia and uia signed a  declaration of interdependence for a sustainable future   in summary  the declaration states that today s society is degrading its environment and that the aia  uia  and their members are committed to   in addition  the interprofessional council on environmental design  iced   a coalition of architectural  landscape architectural  and engineering organizations  developed a vision statement in an attempt to foster a team approach to sustainable design  iced states  the ethics  education and practices of our professions will be directed to shape a sustainable future        to achieve this vision we will join       as a multidisciplinary partnership    these activities are an indication that the concept of sustainable design is being supported on a global and interprofessional scale and that the ultimate goal is to become more environmentally responsive  the world needs facilities that are more energy efficient and that promote conservation and recycling of natural and economic resources  17   applications of this philosophy range from the microcosm \u2014 small objects for everyday use  through to the macrocosm \u2014 buildings  cities  and the earth s physical surface  it is a philosophy that can be applied in the fields of architecture  landscape architecture  urban design  urban planning  engineering  graphic design  industrial design  interior design  fashion design and human-computer interaction   sustainable design is mostly a general reaction to global environmental crises  the rapid growth of economic activity and human population  depletion of natural resources  damage to ecosystems  and loss of biodiversity  18  in 2013  eco architecture writer bridgette meinhold surveyed emergency and long-term sustainable housing projects that were developed in response to these crises in her book  \u201curgent architecture  40 sustainable housing solutions for a changing world  u201d 19][20  featured projects focus on green building  sustainable design  eco-friendly materials  affordability  material reuse  and humanitarian relief  construction methods and materials include repurposed shipping containers  straw bale construction  sandbag homes  and floating homes  21   the limits of sustainable design are reducing  whole earth impacts are beginning to be considered because growth in goods and services is consistently outpacing gains in efficiency  as a result  the net effect of sustainable design to date has been to simply improve the efficiency of rapidly increasing impacts  the present approach  which focuses on the efficiency of delivering individual goods and services  does not solve this problem  the basic dilemmas include  the increasing complexity of efficiency improvements  the difficulty of implementing new technologies in societies built around old ones  that physical impacts of delivering goods and services are not localized  but are distributed throughout the economies  and that the scale of resource use is growing and not stabilizing   because standards of sustainable design appear to emphasize ethics over aesthetics  some designers and critics have complained that it lacks inspiration  pritzker architecture prize winner frank gehry has called green building "bogus   22  and national design awards winner peter eisenman has dismissed it as  having nothing to do with architecture   23  in 2009  the american prospect asked whether  well-designed green architecture  is an "oxymoron   24   others claim that such criticism of sustainable design is misguided  a leading advocate for this alternative view is architect lance hosey  whose book the shape of green  aesthetics  ecology  and design (2012  was the first dedicated to the relationships between sustainability and beauty  hosey argues not just that sustainable design needs to be aesthetically appealing in order to be successful  but also that following the principles of sustainability to their logical conclusion requires reimagining the shape of everything designed  creating things of even greater beauty  reviewers have suggested that the ideas in the shape of green could  revolutionize what it means to be sustainable   25  small and large buildings are beginning to successfully incorporate principles of sustainability into award-winning designs  examples include one central park and the science faculty building  uts   according to jonathan chapman of the university of brighton  uk  emotionally durable design reduces the consumption and waste of natural resources by increasing the resilience of relationships established between consumers and products   26  essentially  product replacement is delayed by strong emotional ties  27  in his book  emotionally durable design  objects  experiences  amp  empathy  chapman describes how  the process of consumption is  and has always been  motivated by complex emotional drivers  and is about far more than just the mindless purchasing of newer and shinier things  it is a journey towards the ideal or desired self  that through cyclical loops of desire and disappointment  becomes a seemingly endless process of serial destruction   28  therefore  a product requires an attribute  or number of attributes  which extend beyond utilitarianism  29   according to chapman   emotional durability  can be achieved through consideration of the following five elements   as a strategic approach   emotionally durable design provides a useful language to describe the contemporary relevance of designing responsible  well made  tactile products which the user can get to know and assign value to in the long-term   30  according to hazel clark and david brody of parsons the new school for design in new york  \u201cemotionally durable design is a call for professionals and students alike to prioritise the relationships between design and its users  as a way of developing more sustainable attitudes to  and in  design things  u201d 31   sustainable architecture is the design of sustainable buildings  sustainable architecture attempts to reduce the collective environmental impacts during the production of building components  during the construction process  as well as during the lifecycle of the building  heating  electricity use  carpet cleaning etc   this design practice emphasizes efficiency of heating and cooling systems  alternative energy sources such as solar hot water  appropriate building siting  reused or recycled building materials  on-site power generation - solar technology  ground source heat pumps  wind power  rainwater harvesting for gardening  washing and aquifer recharge  and on-site waste management such as green roofs that filter and control stormwater runoff  this requires close cooperation of the design team  the architects  the engineers  and the client at all project stages  from site selection  scheme formation  material selection and procurement  to project implementation  32   sustainable architects design with sustainable living in mind  33  sustainable vs green design is the challenge that designs not only reflect healthy processes and uses but are powered by renewable energies and site specific resources  a test for sustainable design is \u2014 can the design function for its intended use without fossil fuel \u2014 unplugged  this challenge suggests architects and planners design solutions that can function without pollution rather than just reducing pollution  as technology progresses in architecture and design theories and as examples are built and tested  architects will soon be able to create not only passive  null-emission buildings  but rather be able to integrate the entire power system into the building design  in 2004 the 59 home housing community  the solar settlement  and a 60,000\xa0sq xa0ft (5,600\xa0m2  integrated retail  commercial and residential building  the sun ship  were completed by architect rolf disch in freiburg  germany  the solar settlement is the first housing community worldwide in which every home  all 59  produce a positive energy balance  34   an essential element of sustainable building design is indoor environmental quality including air quality  illumination  thermal conditions  and acoustics  the integrated design of the indoor environment is essential and must be part of the integrated design of the entire structure  ashrae guideline 10-2011 addresses the interactions among indoor environmental factors and goes beyond traditional standards  35   concurrently  the recent movements of new urbanism and new classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction  that appreciates and develops smart growth  architectural tradition and classical design  36][37  this in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture  as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl  38  both trends started in the 1980s  the driehaus architecture prize is an award that recognizes efforts in new urbanism and new classical architecture  and is endowed with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist pritzker prize  39   tacos  sustainable landscape architecture is a category of sustainable design and energy-efficient landscaping concerned with the planning and design of outdoor space  plants and materials may be bought from local growers to reduce energy used in transportation  design techniques include planting trees to shade buildings from the sun or protect them from wind  using local materials  and on-site composting and chipping not only to reduce green waste hauling but to increase organic matter and therefore carbon in the soil   some designers and gardeners such as beth chatto also use drought-resistant plants in arid areas  xeriscaping  and elsewhere so that water is not taken from local landscapes and habitats for irrigation  water from building roofs may be collected in rain gardens so that the groundwater is recharged  instead of rainfall becoming surface runoff and increasing the risk of flooding   areas of the garden and landscape can also be allowed to grow wild to encourage bio-diversity  native animals may also be encouraged in many other ways  by plants which provide food such as nectar and pollen for insects  or roosting or nesting habitats such as trees  or habitats such as ponds for amphibians and aquatic insects  pesticides  especially persistent pesticides  must be avoided to avoid killing wildlife   soil fertility can be managed sustainably by the use of many layers of vegetation from trees to ground-cover plants and mulches to increase organic matter and therefore earthworms and mycorrhiza  nitrogen-fixing plants instead of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers  and sustainably harvested seaweed extract to replace micronutrients   sustainable landscapes and gardens can be productive as well as ornamental  growing food  firewood and craft materials from beautiful places   sustainable landscape approaches and labels include organic farming and growing  permaculture  agroforestry  forest gardens  agroecology  vegan organic gardening  ecological gardening and climate-friendly gardening   sustainable agriculture adheres to three main goals   a variety of philosophies  policies and practices have contributed to these goals  people in many different capacities  from farmers to consumers  have shared this vision and contributed to it  despite the diversity of people and perspectives  the following themes commonly weave through definitions of sustainable agriculture   there are strenuous discussions \u2014 among others by the agricultural sector and authorities \u2014 if existing pesticide protocols and methods of soil conservation adequately protect topsoil and wildlife  doubt has risen if these are sustainable  and if agrarian reforms would permit an efficient agriculture with fewer pesticides  therefore reducing the damage to the ecosystem   for more information on the subject of sustainable agriculture   uc davis  sustainable agriculture research and education program   40   automobiles  home appliances and furnitures can be designed for repair and disassembly  for recycling   and constructed from recyclable materials such as steel  aluminum and glass  and renewable materials  such as zelfo  wood and plastics from natural feedstocks  careful selection of materials and manufacturing processes can often create products comparable in price and performance to non-sustainable products  even mild design efforts can greatly increase the sustainable content of manufactured items   sustainable technology in the energy sector is based on utilizing renewable sources of energy such as solar  wind  hydro  bioenergy  geothermal  and hydrogen  wind energy is the world s fastest growing energy source  it has been in use for centuries in europe and more recently in the united states and other nations  wind energy is captured through the use of wind turbines that generate and transfer electricity for utilities  homeowners and remote villages  solar power can be harnessed through photovoltaics  concentrating solar  or solar hot water and is also a rapidly growing energy source  41   the availability  potential  and feasibility of primary renewable energy resources must be analyzed early in the planning process as part of a comprehensive energy plan  the plan must justify energy demand and supply and assess the actual costs and benefits to the local  regional  and global environments  responsible energy use is fundamental to sustainable development and a sustainable future  energy management must balance justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply  the process couples energy awareness  energy conservation  and energy efficiency with the use of primary renewable energy resources  42   sustainable manufacturing can be defined as the creation of a manufactured product through a concurrent improvement in the resulting effect on factory and product sustainability  the concept of sustainable manufacturing demands a renewed design of production systems in order to condition the related sustainability on product life cycle and factory operations   sustainable water technologies have become an important industry segment with several companies now providing important and scalable solutions to supply water in a sustainable manner   beyond the use of certain technologies  sustainable design in water management also consists very importantly in correct implementation of concepts  among one of these principal concepts is the fact normally in developed countries 100  of water destined for consumption  that is not necessarily for drinking purposes  is of potable water quality  this concept of differentiating qualities of water for different purposes has been called "fit-for-purpose   43  this more rational use of water achieves several economies  that are not only related to water itself  but also the consumption of energy  as to achieve water of drinking quality can be extremely energy intensive for several reasons   in some countries the term sustainable design is known as ecodesign  green design or environmental design  victor papanek  embraced social design and social quality and ecological quality  but did not explicitly combine these areas of design concern in one term  sustainable design and design for sustainability are more common terms  including the triple bottom line  people  planet and profit   citation needed   in the eu  the concept of sustainable design is referred to as ecodesign  little discussions have however taken place over the importance of this concept in the run-up to the circular economy package  that the european commission will be tabling by the end of 2015  to this effect  an ecothis eu campaign was launched to raise awareness about the economic and environmental consequences of not including eco-design as part of the circular economy package  44   sustainable technologies use less energy  fewer limited resources  do not deplete natural resources  do not directly or indirectly pollute the environment  and can be reused or recycled at the end of their useful life  45  there is significant overlap with appropriate technology  which emphasizes the suitability of technology to the context  in particular considering the needs of people in developing countries  however  the most appropriate technology may not be the most sustainable one  and a sustainable technology may have high cost or maintenance requirements that make it unsuitable as an  appropriate technology   as that term is commonly used
