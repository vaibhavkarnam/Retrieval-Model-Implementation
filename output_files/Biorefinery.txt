Biorefinery
 a biorefinery is a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels  power  heat  and value-added chemicals from biomass  the biorefinery concept is analogous to today s petroleum refinery  which produce multiple fuels and products from petroleum  1   the international energy agency bioenergy task 42 on biorefineries has defined biorefining as the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of bio-based products  food  feed  chemicals  materials  and bioenergy  biofuels  power and or heat    by producing multiple products  a biorefinery takes advantage of the various components in biomass and their intermediates therefore maximizing the value derived from the biomass feedstock  some researcher have considered the exploration of a biorefinery as a practical method of improving the economic performance of stand-alone biomass to bioenergy system since biochemicals are produced 2  a biorefinery could  for example  produce one or several low-volume  but high-value  chemical or nutraceutical products and a low-value  but high-volume liquid transportation fuel such as biodiesel or bioethanol  see also alcohol fuel   3  at the same time generating electricity and process heat  through combined heat and power  chp  technology  for its own use and perhaps enough for sale of electricity to the local utility  the high-value products increase profitability  the high-volume fuel helps meet energy needs  and the power production helps to lower energy costs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from traditional power plant facilities  although some facilities exist that can be called bio-refineries  the bio-refinery has yet to be fully realized  future biorefineries may play a major role in producing chemicals and materials that are traditionally produced from petroleum       the fully operational blue marble energy company has multiple biorefineries located in odessa  wa and missoula  mt   canada s first integrated biorefinery  developed on anaerobic digestion technology by himark biogas is located in hairy hill  alberta  the biorefinery utilizes source separated organics from the metro edmonton region  open pen feedlot manure  and food processing waste   several potential biorefinery examples have been proposed  starting from feedstocks such as tobacco  flax straw and the residues from the production of bioethanol  4  biorefineries have also been proposed to gather as much materials from trees  i e  cellulose  hemicellulose  lignine  lipids  as possible  5   chemrec s technology for black liquor gasification and production of second-generation biofuels such as biomethanol or biodme is integrated with a host pulp mill and utilizes a major sulfate or sulfite process waste product as feedstock  6   the first comprehensive and conceptual work on biorefineries should be cited as a reference  b  kamm  p g  gruber  m  kamm  edts   biorefieries - industrial processes and products  weinheim xa0  wiley-vch (2006   the work of iea bioenergy task 42 has recently been reviews by e  de jong  g  jungmeter  biorefinerie concepts in comparison to petrochemical refineries  in a  pandey  r  h xf6fer  m  taherzadeh  k  madhavan nampoothiri  c  larroche  edts   industrial biorefineries and white biotechnology  amsterdam  oxford  waltham xa0  elsevier (2015  pp  33
