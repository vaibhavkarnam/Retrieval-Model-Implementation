Gridenergystorage
 grid energy storage  also called large-scale energy storage  is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy on a large scale within an electrical power grid  electrical energy is stored during times when production  especially from intermittent power plants such as renewable electricity sources such as wind power  tidal power  solar power  exceeds consumption  and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption   as of 2016 by far the largest form of grid energy storage on grids is dammed hydroelectricity  with both conventional hydroelectric generation as well as pumped storage   an alternative to grid storage is the use of peaking power plants to fill in       the stores are used - feeding power to the grids - at times when consumption that cannot be deferred or delayed exceeds production  in this way  electricity production need not be drastically scaled up and down to meet momentary consumption xa0\u2013 instead  transmission from the combination of generators plus storage facilities is maintained at a more constant level   an alternate and complementary approach to achieve the same effect as grid energy storage is to use a smart grid communication infrastructure to enable demand response  dr   both of these technologies shift energy usage and transmission of power on the grid from one time  when it s not useful  to another  when it s desperately immediately needed    any electrical power grid must adapt energy production to energy consumption  both of which vary drastically over time  any combination of energy storage and demand response has these advantages   energy derived from photovoltaic  tidal and wind sources inherently varies \xa0\u2013 the amount of electrical energy produced varies with time of day  moon phase  season  and random factors such as the weather  thus  renewables present special challenges to electric utilities  while hooking up many separate wind sources can reduce the overall variability  solar is reliably not available at night  except when stored in molten salt  and tidal power shifts with the moon  so it is never reliably available on peak demand   how much this affects any given utility varies significantly  in a summer peak utility  more solar can generally be absorbed and matched to demand  in winter peak utilities  to a lesser degree  wind correlates to heating demand and can be used to meet that demand  depending on these factors  beyond about 20-40  of total generation  grid-connected intermittent energy sources such as photovoltaics and wind turbines tend to require investment in either grid energy storage or demand side management or both   in an electrical power grid without energy storage  energy sources that rely on energy stored within fuels  coal  oil  gas  nuclear  must be scaled up and down to match the rise and fall of energy production from intermittent energy sources  see load following power plant   while oil and gas plants can be scaled up when wind dies down quickly  coal and nuclear plants take considerable time to respond to load  utilities with less gas or oil power generation are thus more reliant on demand management and grid storage   the french consulting firm yole d xe9veloppement figures this \u201cstationary storage u201d market could be a $13.5 billion opportunity by 2023  compared with less than $1 billion in 2015.[1   the demand side can also store energy from the grid  for example charging a battery electric vehicle stores energy for a vehicle and storage heaters  district heating storage or ice storage provide thermal storage for buildings  2  at present this storage serves only to shift consumption to the off-peak time of day  no energy is returned to the grid   the need for grid storage to provide peak power is reduced by demand side time of use pricing  one of the benefits of smart meters  at the household level  consumers may choose less expensive off-peak times for clothes washer dryers  dishwashers  showers and cooking  as well commercial and industrial users will take advantage of cost savings by deferring some processes to off-peak times   regional impacts from the unpredictable operation of wind power has created a new need for interactive demand response  where the utility communicates with the demand  historically this was only done in cooperation with large industrial consumers  but now may be expanded to entire grids  3  for instance a few large scale projects in europe link variations in wind power to change industrial food freezer loads  causing small variations in temperature  if communicated on a grid-wide scale  small changes to heating cooling temperatures would instantly change consumption across the grid  whether or not to consider more-deeply-frozen food or more-heated water a form of energy storage is debatable   a report released in december 2013 by the united states department of energy further describes the potential benefits of energy storage and demand side technologies to the electric grid  \u201cmodernizing the electric system will help the nation meet the challenge of handling projected energy needs u2014including addressing climate change by integrating more energy from renewable sources and enhancing efficiency from non-renewable energy processes  advances to the electric grid must maintain a robust and resilient electricity delivery system  and energy storage can play a significant role in meeting these challenges by improving the operating capabilities of the grid  lowering cost and ensuring high reliability  as well as deferring and reducing infrastructure investments  finally  energy storage can be instrumental for emergency preparedness because of its ability to provide backup power as well as grid stabilization services  u201d [4  the report was written by a core group of developers representing office of electricity delivery and energy reliability  arpa-e  office of science  office of energy efficiency and renewable energy  sandia national laboratories  and pacific northwest national laboratory  all of whom are engaged in the development of grid energy storage  4   another grid energy storage method is to use off-peak or renewably generated electricity to compress air  which is usually stored in an old mine or some other kind of geological feature  when electricity demand is high  the compressed air is heated with a small amount of natural gas and then goes through turboexpanders to generate electricity  5   compressed air storage is typically around 60 - 90  efficient 6   another electricity storage method is to compress and cool air  turning it into liquid air  7  which can be stored  and expanded when needed  turning a turbine  generating electricity  with a storage efficiency of up to 70%.[8   battery storage was used in the early days of direct current electric power  where ac grid power was not readily available  isolated lighting plants run by wind turbines or internal combustion engines provided lighting and power to small motors  the battery system could be used to run the load without starting the engine or when the wind was calm  a bank of lead-acid batteries in glass jars both supplied power to illuminate lamps  as well as to start an engine to recharge the batteries   battery systems connected to large solid-state converters have been used to stabilize power distribution networks  for example  in puerto rico a system with a capacity of 20 megawatts for 15 minutes (5 megawatt hour  stabilizes the frequency of electric power produced on the island  a 27 megawatt 15-minute (6.75 megawatt hour  nickel-cadmium battery bank was installed at fairbanks alaska in 2003 to stabilize voltage at the end of a long transmission line  10  many  off-the-grid  domestic systems rely on battery storage  see battery storage power station    other possible large-scale storage technologies include flow  liquid metal 11  and sodium-ion batteries  sodium-sulfur batteries could also be inexpensive to implement on a large scale and have been used for grid storage in japan and in the united states  12  magnesium-antimony batteries are under development  13   in 2016 a zinc-ion battery was proposed for use in grid storage applications  14   in 2017 the california public utilities commission installed 396 refrigerator-sized stacks of tesla batteries at the mira loma substation in ontario  california that are capable of powering 15,000 homes for over four hours  15   rechargeable flow batteries can be used as a rapid-response storage medium  16  vanadium redox batteries is another flow battery  17  they are installed at huxley hill wind farm  australia   tomari wind hills at hokkaid u014d  japan   as well as in non-wind farm applications  a 12 mw xb7h flow battery was to be installed at the sorne hill wind farm (ireland   18  these storage systems are designed to smooth out transient wind fluctuations  hydrogen bromide has been proposed for use in a utility-scale flow-type battery  19   byd proposes to use conventional consumer battery technologies such as lithium iron phosphate (lifepo4  battery  connecting many batteries in parallel   some grid batteries are co-located with renewable energy plants  either to smooth the power supplied by the intermittent wind or solar output  or to shift the power output into other hours of the day when the renewable plant cannot produce power directly  see installation examples    the largest grid storage batteries in the united states include the 31.5mw battery at grand ridge power plant in illinois and the 31.5 mw battery at beech ridge  west virginia  20  two batteries under construction in 2015 include the 400mwh (100mw for 4 hours  southern california edison project and the 52 mwh project on kauai  hawaii to entirely time shift a 13mw solar farm s output to the evening  21  two batteries are in fairbanks  alaska (40 mw for 7 minutes using ni-cd cells   22  and in notrees  texas (36 mw for 40 minutes using lead-acid batteries   23][24  a 13 mwh battery made of worn batteries from electric cars is being constructed in germany  with an expected second life of 10 years  25   in 2015  a 221 mw battery storage was installed in the usa  with total capacity expected to reach 1.7 gw in 2020.[26   battery storage technology is typically around 50 - &gt 85  efficient [29][30   companies are researching the possible use of electric vehicles to meet peak demand  a parked and plugged-in electric vehicle could sell the electricity from the battery during peak loads and charge either during night  at home  or during off-peak  31   plug-in hybrid or electric cars could be used [32][33][34  for their energy storage capabilities  vehicle-to-grid technology can be employed  turning each vehicle with its 20 to 50\xa0kwh battery pack into a distributed load-balancing device or emergency power source  this represents 2 to 5 days per vehicle of average household requirements of 10\xa0kwh per day  assuming annual consumption of 3650\xa0kwh  this quantity of energy is equivalent to between 40 and 300 miles (64 and 483\xa0km  of range in such vehicles consuming 0.5 to 0.16\xa0kwh per mile  these figures can be achieved even in home-made electric vehicle conversions  some electric utilities plan to use old plug-in vehicle batteries  sometimes resulting in a giant battery  to store electricity 35][36  however  a large disadvantage of using vehicle to grid energy storage is the fact that each storage cycle stresses the battery with one complete charge-discharge cycle  32  conventional  cobalt-based  lithium ion batteries break down with the number of cycles - newer li-ion batteries do not break down significantly with each cycle  and so have much longer lives  one approach is to reuse unreliable vehicle batteries in dedicated grid storage [3  as they are expected to be good in this role for ten years [4   if such storage is done on a large scale it becomes much easier to guarantee replacement of a vehicle battery degraded in mobile use  as the old battery has value and immediate use   mechanical inertia is the basis of this storage method  when the electric power flows into the device  an electric motor accelerates a heavy rotating disc  the motor acts as a generator when the flow of power is reversed  slowing down the disc and producing electricity  electricity is stored as the kinetic energy of the disc  friction must be kept to a minimum to prolong the storage time  this is often achieved by placing the flywheel in a vacuum and using magnetic bearings  tending to make the method expensive  greater flywheel speeds allow greater storage capacity but require strong materials such as steel or composite materials to resist the centrifugal forces  the ranges of power and energy storage technology that make this method economic  however  tends to make flywheels unsuitable for general power system application  they are probably best suited to load-leveling applications on railway power systems and for improving power quality in renewable energy systems such as the 20mw system in ireland  37][38   applications that use flywheel storage are those that require very high bursts of power for very short durations such as tokamak 39  and laser experiments where a motor generator is spun up to operating speed and is partially slowed down during discharge   flywheel storage is also currently used in the form of the diesel rotary uninterruptible power supply to provide uninterruptible power supply systems  such as those in large datacenters  for ride-through power necessary during transfer 40]\xa0\u2013 that is  the relatively brief amount of time between a loss of power to the mains and the warm-up of an alternate source  such as a diesel generator   this potential solution has been implemented by eda 41][better xa0source xa0needed  in the azores on the islands of graciosa and flores  this system uses an 18 megawatt-second flywheel to improve power quality and thus allow increased renewable energy usage  as the description suggests  these systems are again designed to smooth out transient fluctuations in supply  and could never be used to cope with an outage exceeding a couple of days   powercorp in australia have been developing applications using wind turbines  flywheels and low load diesel  lld  technology to maximise the wind input to small grids  a system installed in coral bay  western australia  uses wind turbines coupled with a flywheel based control system and llds to achieve better than 60  wind contribution to the town grid  citation needed   hydrogen is being developed as an electrical energy storage medium  32][42  hydrogen is produced  then compressed or liquefied  cryogenicly stored at \u2212252.882\xa0\xb0c  and then converted back to electrical energy or heat  hydrogen can be used as a fuel for portable  vehicles  or stationary energy generation  compared to pumped water storage and batteries  hydrogen has the advantage that it is a high energy density fuel  42   hydrogen can be produced either by reforming natural gas with steam or by the electrolysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen  see hydrogen production   reforming natural gas produces carbon dioxide as a by-product  high temperature electrolysis and high pressure electrolysis are two techniques by which the efficiency of hydrogen production may be able to be increased  hydrogen is then converted back to electricity in an internal combustion engine  or a fuel cell   the ac-to-ac efficiency of hydrogen storage has been shown to be on the order of 20 to 45   which imposes economic constraints  42][43  the price ratio between purchase and sale of electricity must be at least proportional to the efficiency in order for the system to be economic  hydrogen fuel cells can respond quickly enough to correct rapid fluctuations in electricity demand or supply and regulate frequency  whether hydrogen can use natural gas infrastructure depends on the network construction materials  standards in joints  and storage pressure  44   the equipment necessary for hydrogen energy storage includes an electrolysis plant  hydrogen compressors or liquifiers  and storage tanks   biohydrogen is a process being investigated for producing hydrogen using biomass   micro combined heat and power  microchp  can use hydrogen as a fuel   some nuclear power plants may be able to benefit from a symbiosis with hydrogen production  high temperature (950 to 1,000\xa0\xb0c  gas cooled nuclear generation iv reactors have the potential to electrolyze hydrogen from water by thermochemical means using nuclear heat as in the sulfur-iodine cycle  the first commercial reactors are expected in 2030   a community based pilot program using wind turbines and hydrogen generators was started in 2007 in the remote community of ramea  newfoundland and labrador  45  a similar project has been going on since 2004 in utsira  a small norwegian island municipality   underground hydrogen storage is the practice of hydrogen storage in underground caverns  salt domes and depleted oil and gas fields  32][46  large quantities of gaseous hydrogen have been stored in underground caverns by imperial chemical industries  ici  for many years without any difficulties  47  the european project hyunder 48  indicated in 2013 that for the storage of wind and solar energy an additional 85 caverns are required as it can t be covered by phes and caes systems  49   power to gas is a technology which converts electrical power to a gas fuel  there are 2 methods  the first is to use the electricity for water splitting and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid  the second less efficient method is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane   see natural gas  using electrolysis and the sabatier reaction  the excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays is then used for load balancing in the energy grid  using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen  fuel cell maker hydrogenics and natural gas distributor enbridge have teamed up to develop such a power to gas system in canada  43   pipeline storage of hydrogen where a natural gas network is used for the storage of hydrogen  before switching to natural gas  the german gas networks were operated using towngas  which for the most part consisted of hydrogen  the storage capacity of the german natural gas network is more than 200,000 gw xb7h which is enough for several months of energy requirement  by comparison  the capacity of all german pumped storage power plants amounts to only about 40 gw xb7h  the transport of energy through a gas network is done with much less loss (&lt 0.1   than in a power network (8   clarification needed   the use of the existing natural gas pipelines for hydrogen was studied by naturalhy 50   the power-to-ammonia concept offers a carbon-free energy storage route with a diversified application palette  at times when there is a surplus of renewable electricity  it can be converted to ammonia locally using small-scale plants  existing technology can be used to produce ammonia by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen with the help of electricity  then using high temperature and pressure to convert the hydrogen plus nitrogen from the air into ammonia  ammonia is similar to propane when stored in liquid form  unlike hydrogen which is difficult to liquefy and store cryogenicly at \u2212252.882\xa0\xb0c   just like natural gas  the produced and stored ammonia can be used by energy companies at any time as fuel for electricity generation  ammonia can be stored as a liquid  a standard tank of 60,000 m3 contains about 211 gwh of energy  equivalent to the annual production of roughly 30 wind turbines on land  ammonia can be burned cleanly  water and nitrogen are released  but no co2 and little or no nitrogen oxides  ammonia can be further used as a flexible chemical as a fertilizer  chemical commodity  de-nox agent and energy carrier  given this flexibility of usage  and given the fact that the supporting infrastructure for the transport  distribution and usage of ammonia is already in place  it makes ammonia a good candidate to be a large-scale  non-carbon  energy carrier of the future   in 2008 world pumped storage generating capacity was 104 gw  51  while other sources claim 127 gw  which comprises the vast majority of all types of grid electric storage - all other types combined are some hundreds of mw  52   in many places  pumped storage hydroelectricity is used to even out the daily generating load  by pumping water to a high storage reservoir during off-peak hours and weekends  using the excess base-load capacity from coal or nuclear sources  during peak hours  this water can be used for hydroelectric generation  often as a high value rapid-response reserve to cover transient peaks in demand  pumped storage recovers about 70  to 85  of the energy consumed  and is currently the most cost effective form of mass power storage  53  the chief problem with pumped storage is that it usually requires two nearby reservoirs at considerably different heights  and often requires considerable capital expenditure  54   pumped water systems have high dispatchability  meaning they can come on-line very quickly  typically within 15 seconds  55  which makes these systems very efficient at soaking up variability in electrical demand from consumers  there is over 90 gw of pumped storage in operation around the world  which is about 3  of instantaneous global generation capacity  pumped water storage systems  such as the dinorwig storage system in britain  hold five or six hours of generating capacity  55  and are used to smooth out demand variations   another example is the tianhuangping pumped-storage hydro plant in china  which has a reservoir capacity of eight million cubic meters (2.1 billion u s  gallons or the volume of water over niagara falls in 25 minutes  with a vertical distance of 600 m (1970\xa0feet   the reservoir can provide about 13 gw xb7h of stored gravitational potential energy  convertible to electricity at about 80  efficiency   or about 2  of china s daily electricity consumption  56   a new concept in pumped-storage is utilizing wind energy or solar power to pump water  wind turbines or solar cells that direct drive water pumps for an energy storing wind or solar dam can make this a more efficient process but are limited  such systems can only increase kinetic water volume during windy and daylight periods   hydroelectric dams with large reservoirs can also be operated to provide peak generation at times of peak demand  water is stored in the reservoir during periods of low demand and released through the plant when demand is higher  the net effect is the same as pumped storage  but without the pumping loss  depending on the reservoir capacity the plant can provide daily  weekly  or seasonal load following   many existing hydroelectric dams are fairly old  for example  the hoover dam was built in the 1930s   and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades  a hydroelectric dam originally built to provide baseload power will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir  uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power output capacity  thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy storage unit  57][58  the united states bureau of reclamation reports an investment cost of $69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam  57  compared to more than $400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators  while an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units  it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel \u2013 incoming river water \u2013 during periods of high output from other generating units  functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way  the uprated dam is one of the most efficient forms of energy storage  because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir  only increased losses to evaporation and leakage   a dam which impounds a large reservoir can store and release a correspondingly large amount of energy  by controlling river outflow and raising or lowering its reservoir level a few meters  limitations do apply to dam operation  their releases are commonly subject to government regulated water rights to limit downstream effect on rivers  for example  there are grid situations where baseload thermal plants  nuclear or wind turbines are already producing excess power at night  dams are still required to release enough water to maintain adequate river levels  whether electricity is generated or not  conversely there s a limit to peak capacity  which if excessive could cause a river to flood for a few hours each day  59   superconducting magnetic energy storage  smes  systems store energy in the magnetic field created by the flow of direct current in a superconducting coil which has been cryogenically cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature  a typical smes system includes three parts  superconducting coil  power conditioning system and cryogenically cooled refrigerator  once the superconducting coil is charged  the current will not decay and the magnetic energy can be stored indefinitely  the stored energy can be released back to the network by discharging the coil  the power conditioning system uses an inverter rectifier to transform alternating current  ac  power to direct current or convert dc back to ac power  the inverter rectifier accounts for about 2\u20133  energy loss in each direction  smes loses the least amount of electricity in the energy storage process compared to other methods of storing energy  smes systems are highly efficient  the round-trip efficiency is greater than 95   the high cost of superconductors is the primary limitation for commercial use of this energy storage method   due to the energy requirements of refrigeration  and the limits in the total energy able to be stored  smes is currently used for short duration energy storage  therefore  smes is most commonly devoted to improving power quality  if smes were to be used for utilities it would be a diurnal storage device  charged from base load power at night and meeting peak loads during the day   superconducting magnetic energy storage technical challenges are yet to be solved for it to become practical   in denmark the direct storage of electricity is perceived as too expensive for very large scale usage  albeit significant usage is made of existing norwegian hydro  instead  the use of existing hot water storage tanks connected to district heating schemes  heated by either electrode boilers or heat pumps  is seen as a preferable approach  the stored heat is then transmitted to dwellings using district heating pipes   molten salt is used to store heat collected by a solar power tower so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night  60   off-peak electricity can be used to make ice from water  and the ice can be stored  the stored ice can be used to cool the air in a large building which would have normally used electric ac  thereby shifting the electric load to off-peak hours  on other systems stored ice is used to cool the intake air of a gas turbine generator  thus increasing the on-peak generation capacity and the on-peak efficiency   a pumped heat electricity storage system uses a highly reversible heat engine heat pump to pump heat between two storage vessels  heating one and cooling the other  the uk-based engineering company isentropic that is developing the system claims a potential electricity-in to electricity-out round-trip efficiency of 72-80%.[61   according to scientific american  ski lifts and trains tracks are among places being considered to store energy by moving heavy objects up or down inclines  62   the levelized cost of storing electricity depends highly on storage type and purpose  as subsecond-scale frequency regulation  minute hour-scale peaker plants  or day week-scale season storage  63][64   using battery storage is said to be u 0.12[65]-0.17[66  per kwh   generally speaking  energy storage is economical when the marginal cost of electricity varies more than the costs of storing and retrieving the energy plus the price of energy lost in the process  for instance  assume a pumped-storage reservoir can pump to its upper reservoir a volume of water capable of producing 1,200 mw xb7h after all losses are factored in  evaporation and seeping in the reservoir  efficiency losses  etc    if the marginal cost of electricity during off-peak times is $15 per mw xb7h  and the reservoir operates at 75  efficiency  i e   1,600 mw xb7h are consumed and 1,200 mw xb7h of energy are retrieved   then the total cost of filling the reservoir is $24,000  if all of the stored energy is sold the following day during peak hours for an average $40 per mw xb7h  then the reservoir will see revenues of $48,000 for the day  for a gross profit of $24,000   however  the marginal cost of electricity varies because of the varying operational and fuel costs of different classes of generators  at one extreme  base load power plants such as coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plants are low marginal cost generators  as they have high capital and maintenance costs but low fuel costs  at the other extreme  peaking power plants such as gas turbine natural gas plants burn expensive fuel but are cheaper to build  operate and maintain  to minimize the total operational cost of generating power  base load generators are dispatched most of the time  while peak power generators are dispatched only when necessary  generally when energy demand peaks  this is called  economic dispatch    demand for electricity from the world s various grids varies over the course of the day and from season to season  for the most part  variation in electric demand is met by varying the amount of electrical energy supplied from primary sources  increasingly  however  operators are storing lower-cost energy produced at night  then releasing it to the grid during the peak periods of the day when it is more valuable  67  in areas where hydroelectric dams exist  release can be delayed until demand is greater  this form of storage is common and can make use of existing reservoirs  this is not storing  surplus  energy produced elsewhere  but the net effect is the same - although without the efficiency losses  renewable supplies with variable production  like wind and solar power  tend to increase the net variation in electric load  increasing the opportunity for grid energy storage   it may be more economical to find an alternative market for unused electricity  rather than try and store it  high voltage direct current allows for transmission of electricity  losing only 3  per 1000\xa0km   the united states department of energy s international energy storage database provides a free list of grid energy storage projects  many of which show funding sources and amounts  68   the demand for electricity from consumers and industry is constantly changing  broadly within the following categories   there are currently three main methods for dealing with changing demand   the problem with standby gas turbines is higher costs  expensive generating equipment is unused much of the time  spinning reserve also comes at a cost  plants run below maximum output are usually less efficient  grid energy storage is used to shift generation from times of peak load to off-peak hours  power plants are able to run at their peak efficiency during nights and weekends   supply-demand leveling strategies may be intended to reduce the cost of supplying peak power or to compensate for the intermittent generation of wind and solar power   in order to keep the supply of electricity consistent and to deal with varying electrical loads it is necessary to decrease the difference between generation and demand  if this is done by changing loads it is referred to as demand side management  dsm   for decades  utilities have sold off-peak power to large consumers at lower rates  to encourage these users to shift their loads to off-peak hours  in the same way that telephone companies do with individual customers  usually  these time-dependent prices are negotiated ahead of time  in an attempt to save more money  some utilities are experimenting with selling electricity at minute-by-minute spot prices  which allow those users with monitoring equipment to detect demand peaks as they happen  and shift demand to save both the user and the utility money  demand side management can be manual or automatic and is not limited to large industrial customers  in residential and small business applications  for example  appliance control modules can reduce energy usage of water heaters  air conditioning units  refrigerators  and other devices during these periods by turning them off for some portion of the peak demand time or by reducing the power that they draw  energy demand management includes more than reducing overall energy use or shifting loads to off-peak hours  a particularly effective method of energy demand management involves encouraging electric consumers to install more energy efficient equipment  for example  many utilities give rebates for the purchase of insulation  weatherstripping  and appliances and light bulbs that are energy efficient  some utilities subsidize the purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers  to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70  more efficient  as well as to reduce the winter electricity demand compared to conventional air-sourced heat pumps or resistive heating  70  companies with factories and large buildings can also install such products  but they can also buy energy efficient industrial equipment  like boilers  or use more efficient processes to produce products  companies may get incentives like rebates or low interest loans from utilities or the government for the installation of energy efficient industrial equipment  facilities may shift their demand by enlisting a third party to provide energy storage as a service  esaas    this is the area of greatest success for current energy storage technologies  single-use and rechargeable batteries are ubiquitous  and provide power for devices with demands as varied as digital watches and cars  advances in battery technology have generally been slow  however  with much of the advance in battery life that consumers see being attributable to efficient power management rather than increased storage capacity  portable consumer electronics have benefited greatly from size and power reductions associated with moore s law  unfortunately  moore s law does not apply to hauling people and freight  the underlying energy requirements for transportation remain much higher than for information and entertainment applications  battery capacity has become an issue as pressure grows for alternatives to internal combustion engines in cars  trucks  buses  trains  ships  and aeroplanes  these uses require far more energy density  the amount of energy stored in a given volume or weight  than current battery technology can deliver  liquid hydrocarbon fuel  such as gasoline petrol and diesel   as well as alcohols  methanol  ethanol  and butanol  and lipids  straight vegetable oil  biodiesel  have much higher energy densities   there are synthetic pathways for using electricity to reduce carbon dioxide and water to liquid hydrocarbon or alcohol fuels  71  these pathways begin with electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen  and then reducing carbon dioxide with excess hydrogen in variations of the reverse water gas shift reaction  non-fossil sources of carbon dioxide include fermentation plants and sewage treatment plants  converting electrical energy to carbon-based liquid fuel has potential to provide portable energy storage usable by the large existing stock of motor vehicles and other engine-driven equipment  without the difficulties of dealing with hydrogen or another exotic energy carrier  these synthetic pathways may attract attention in connection with attempts to improve energy security in nations that rely on imported petroleum  but have or can develop large sources of renewable or nuclear electricity  as well as to deal with possible future declines in the amount of petroleum available to import   because the transport sector uses the energy from petroleum very inefficiently  replacing petroleum with electricity for mobile energy will not require very large investments over many years  citation needed   virtually all devices that operate on electricity are adversely affected by the sudden removal of their power supply  solutions such as ups  uninterruptible power supplies  or backup generators are available  but these are expensive  efficient methods of power storage would allow for devices to have a built-in backup for power cuts  and also reduce the impact of a failure in a generating station  examples of this are currently available using fuel cells and flywheels
