 in electrical engineering  a protective relay is a relay device designed to trip a circuit breaker when a fault is detected  1]:4 the first protective relays were electromagnetic devices  relying on coils operating on moving parts to provide detection of abnormal operating conditions such as over-current  over-voltage  reverse power flow  over-frequency  and under-frequency  2   microprocessor-based digital protection relays now emulate the original devices  as well as providing types of protection and supervision impractical with electromechanical relays  electromechanical relays provide only rudimentary indications of involved phase and zone targets  3  in many cases a single microprocessor relay provides functions that would take two or more electromechanical devices  by combining several functions in one case  numerical relays also save capital cost and maintenance cost over electromechanical relays  4  however  due to their very long life span  tens of thousands of these  silent sentinels  5  are still protecting transmission lines and electrical apparatus all over the world  important transmission lines and generators have cubicles dedicated to protection  with many individual electromechanical devices  or one or two microprocessor relays   the theory and application of these protective devices is an important part of the education of a power engineer who specializes in power systems  the need to act quickly to protect circuits and equipment as well as the general public often requires protective relays to respond and trip a breaker within a few thousandths of a second  in some instances these clearance times are prescribed in legislation or operating rules  6  a maintenance or testing program is used to determine the performance and availability of protection systems  7   based on the end application and applicable legislature  various standards such as ansi c37.90  iec255-4  iec60255-3  and iac govern the response time of the relay to the fault conditions that may occur  8       electromechanical protective relays operate by either magnetic attraction  or magnetic induction  9]:14 unlike switching type electromechanical relays with fixed and usually ill-defined operating voltage thresholds and operating times  protective relays have well-established  selectable  and adjustable time and current  or other operating parameter  operating characteristics  protection relays may use arrays of induction disks  shaded-pole  9]:25 magnets  operating and restraint coils  solenoid-type operators  telephone-relay contacts  clarification needed  and phase-shifting networks   protective relays can also be classified by the type of measurement they make  10]:92 a protective relay may respond to the magnitude of a quantity such as voltage or current  induction relays can respond to the product of two quantities in two field coils  which could for example represent the power in a circuit    it is not practical to make a relay that develops a torque equal to the quotient of two a c  quantities  this  however is not important  the only significant condition for a relay is its setting and the setting can be made to correspond to a ratio regardless of the component values over a wide range   10]:92  several operating coils can be used to provide  bias  to the relay  allowing the sensitivity of response in one circuit to be controlled by another  various combinations of  operate torque  and  restraint torque  can be produced in the relay   by use of a permanent magnet in the magnetic circuit  a relay can be made to respond to current in one direction differently from in another  such polarized relays are used on direct-current circuits to detect  for example  reverse current into a generator  these relays can be made bistable  maintaining a contact closed with no coil current and requiring reverse current to reset  for ac circuits  the principle is extended with a polarizing winding connected to a reference voltage source   lightweight contacts make for sensitive relays that operate quickly  but small contacts can t carry or break heavy currents  often the measuring relay will trigger auxiliary telephone-type armature relays   in a large installation of electromechanical relays  it would be difficult to determine which device originated the signal that tripped the circuit  this information is useful to operating personnel to determine the likely cause of the fault and to prevent its re-occurrence  relays may be fitted with a  target  or  flag  unit  which is released when the relay operates  to display a distinctive colored signal when the relay has tripped  11   electromechanical relays can be classified into several different types as follows    armature -type relays have a pivoted lever supported on a hinge 12  or knife-edge pivot  which carries a moving contact  these relays may work on either alternating or direct current  but for alternating current  a shading coil on the pole 9]:14 is used to maintain contact force throughout the alternating current cycle  because the air gap between the fixed coil and the moving armature becomes much smaller when the relay has operated  the current required to maintain the relay closed is much smaller than the current to first operate it  the  returning ratio  13  or  differential  is the measure of how much the current must be reduced to reset the relay   a variant application of the attraction principle is the plunger-type or solenoid operator  a reed relay is another example of the attraction principle    moving coil  meters use a loop of wire turns in a stationary magnet  similar to a galvanometer but with a contact lever instead of a pointer  these can be made with very high sensitivity  another type of moving coil suspends the coil from two conductive ligaments  allowing very long travel of the coil    induction  disk meters work by inducing currents in a disk that is free to rotate  the rotary motion of the disk operates a contact  induction relays require alternating current  if two or more coils are used  they must be at the same frequency otherwise no net operating force is produced  11  these electromagnetic relays use the induction principle discovered by galileo ferraris in the late 19th century  the magnetic system in induction disc overcurrent relays is designed to detect overcurrents in a power system and operate with a pre-determined time delay when certain overcurrent limits have been reached  in order to operate  the magnetic system in the relays produces torque that acts on a metal disc to make contact  according to the following basic current torque equation  14   \n n n nt n u221d n n u03d5\n ns n n n xd7\n n u03d5\n nu n n nsin n u2061\n u03b1 n n n

s   n n are the two fluxes and \n n n n u03b1 n n n   displaystyle   alpha   n n is the phase angle between the fluxes  the following important conclusions can be drawn from the above equation  15   the relay s primary winding is supplied from the power systems current transformer via a plug bridge  16  which is called the plug setting multiplier  psm   usually seven equally spaced tappings or operating bands determine the relays sensitivity  the primary winding is located on the upper electromagnet  the secondary winding has connections on the upper electromagnet that are energised from the primary winding and connected to the lower electromagnet  once the upper and lower electromagnets are energised they produce eddy currents that are induced onto the metal disc and flow through the flux paths  this relationship of eddy currents and fluxes creates torque proportional to the input current of the primary winding  due to the two flux paths being out of phase by 90\xb0   in an overcurrent condition  a value of current will be reached that overcomes the control spring pressure on the spindle and the braking magnet  causing the metal disc to rotate towards the fixed contact  this initial movement of the disc is also held off to a critical positive value of current by small slots that are often cut into the side of the disc  the time taken for rotation to make the contacts is not only dependent on current but also the spindle backstop position  known as the time multiplier  tm   the time multiplier is divided into 10 linear divisions of the full rotation time   providing the relay is free from dirt  the metal disc and the spindle with its contact will reach the fixed contact  thus sending a signal to trip and isolate the circuit  within its designed time and current specifications  drop off current of the relay is much lower than its operating value  and once reached the relay will be reset in a reverse motion by the pressure of the control spring governed by the braking magnet   application of electronic amplifiers to protective relays was described as early as 1928  using vacuum tube amplifiers and continued up to 1956.[17  devices using electron tubes were studied but never applied as commercial products  because of the limitations of vacuum tube amplifiers  a relatively large standby current is required to maintain the tube filament temperature  inconvenient high voltages are required for the circuits  and vacuum tube amplifiers had difficulty with incorrect operation due to noise disturbances   static relays have no or few moving parts  and became practical with the introduction of the transistor  measuring elements of static relays have been successfully and economically built up from diodes  zener diodes  avalanche diodes  unijunction transistors  p-n-p and n-p-n bipolar transistors  field effect transistors or their combinations  18]:6 static relays offer the advantage of higher sensitivity than purely electromechanical relays  because power to operate output contacts is derived from a separate supply  not from the signal circuits  static relays eliminated or reduced contact bounce  and could provide fast operation  long life and low maintenance  19   digital protective relays were in their infancy during the late 1960s  20][21  an experimental digital protection system was tested in the lab and in the field in the early 1970s  22][23  unlike the relays mentioned above  digital protective relays have two main parts  hardware and software 24]:5  the world s first commercially available digital protective relay was introduced to the power industry in 1984.[3  in spite of the developments of complex algorithms for implementing protection functions the microprocessor based-relays marketed in the 1980s did not incorporate them  25  a microprocessor-based digital protection relay can replace the functions of many discrete electromechanical instruments  these relays convert voltage and currents to digital form and process the resulting measurements using a microprocessor  the digital relay can emulate functions of many discrete electromechanical relays in one device  26  simplifying protection design and maintenance  each digital relay can run self-test routines to confirm its readiness and alarm if a fault is detected  digital relays can also provide functions such as communications  scada  interface  monitoring of contact inputs  metering  waveform analysis  and other useful features  digital relays can  for example  store multiple sets of protection parameters  27  which allows the behavior of the relay to be changed during maintenance of attached equipment  digital relays also can provide protection strategies impossible to implement with electromechanical relays  this is particularly so in long distance high voltage or multi-terminal circuits or in lines that are series or shunt compensated 24]:3 they also offer benefits in self-testing and communication to supervisory control systems   the distinction between digital and numerical protection relay rests on points of fine technical detail  and is rarely found in areas other than protection 28  ch 7  pp 102  numerical relays are the product of the advances in technology from digital relays  generally  there are several different types of numerical protection relays  each type  however  shares a similar architecture  thus enabling designers to build an entire system solution that is based on a relatively small number of flexible components  8  they use high speed processors executing appropriate algorithms 18]:51.[29][30  most numerical relays are also multifunctional 31  and have multiple setting groups each often with tens or hundreds of settings  32   the various protective functions available on a given relay are denoted by standard ansi device numbers  for example  a relay including function 51 would be a timed overcurrent protective relay   an overcurrent relay is a type of protective relay which operates when the load current exceeds a pickup value  the ansi device number is 50 for an instantaneous over current  ioc  or a definite time overcurrent  dtoc   in a typical application the over current relay is connected to a current transformer and calibrated to operate at or above a specific current level  when the relay operates  one or more contacts will operate and energize to trip  open  a circuit breaker  the definite time overcurrent relay has been used extensively in the united kingdom but its inherent issue of operating slower for faults closer to the source led to the development of the idmt relay  1  pp 30-31  the inverse definite minimum time  idmt  protective relays were developed to overcome the shortcomings of the definite time overcurrent relays  1  pp 30-31[33]:134  if the source impedance remains constant and the fault current changes appreciably as we move away from the relay then it is advantageous to use idmt overcurrent protection 34]:11 to achieve high speed protection over a large section of the protected circuit  28]:127 however  if the source impedance is significantly larger than the feeder impedance then the characteristic of the idmt relay cannot be exploited and dtoc may be utilized  35]:42 secondly if the source impedance varies and becomes weaker with less generation during light loads then this leads to slower clearance time hence negating the purpose of the idmt relay  36]:143  iec standard 60255-151 specifies the idmt relay curves as shown below  the four curves in table 1 are derived from the now withdrawn british standard bs 142.[37  the other five  in table 2  are derived from the ansi standard c37.112.[38   while it is more common to use idmt relays for current protection it is possible to utilize idmt mode of operation for voltage protection 39]:3  it is possible to program customised curves in some protective relays 40  pp ch2-9 and other manufacturers 41]:18 have special curves specific to their relays  some numerical relays can be used to provide inverse time overvoltage protection 42]:6 or negative sequence overcurrent protection  43]:915  the curves derived from bs 142 are defined below   the curves derived from the ansi standard are defined below  these are also referred to as the north american idmt relay characteristics  28]:126  ir   is the ratio of the fault current to the relay setting current or a plug setting multiplier  44  pp 73  plug  is a reference from the electromechanical relay era and were available in discrete 1  pp

result in a  family  of curves as a result of using different time multiplier setting  tms  settings  it is evident from the relay characteristic equations that a larger tms will result in a slower clearance time for a given pms  ir  value   distance relays differ in principle from other forms of protection in that their performance is not governed by the magnitude of the current or voltage in the protected circuit but rather on the ratio of these two quantities  distance relays are actually double actuating quantity relays with one coil energized by voltage and other coil by current  the current element produces a positive or pick up torque while the voltage element produces a negative or reset torque  the relay operates only when the v i ratio falls below a predetermined value or set value   during a fault on the transmission line the fault current increases and the voltage at the fault point decreases  the v i [45  ratio is measured at the location of cts and pts  the voltage at the pt location depends on the distance between the pt and the fault  if the measured voltage is lesser  that means the fault is nearer and vice versa  hence the protection called distance relay  the load flowing through the line appears an impedance to the relay and sufficiently large loads  as impedance is inversely proportional to the load  can lead to a trip of the relay even in the absence of a fault  46]:467   the differential protection is 100  selective and therefore only responds to faults within its protected zone  the boundary of the protected zone is uniquely defined by the location of the current transformers  time grading with other protection systems is therefore not required  allowing for tripping without additional delay   differential protection is therefore suited as fast main protection for all important plant items   47]:15 differential protection can be used to provide protection for plants with multiple terminals 48][49  and can be used to protect lines  50  generators  motors  transformers  and other electrical plant   gfci  ground fault circuit interrupter  circuit breakers combine overcurrent protection and differential protection  non-adjustable  in standard  commonly available modules  citation needed   a directional relay uses an additional polarizing source of voltage or current to determine the direction of a fault  directional elements respond to the phase shift between a polarizing quantity and an operate quantity  51  the fault can be located upstream or downstream of the relay s location  allowing appropriate protective devices to be operated inside or outside of the zone of protection   a synchronism checking relay provides a contact closure when the frequency and phase of two sources are similar to within some tolerance margin  a  synch check  relay is often applied where two power systems are interconnected  such as at a switchyard connecting two power grids  or at a generator circuit breaker to ensure the generator is synchronized to the system before connecting it   the relays can also be divided depending on the type of power source that they use to work   the protection relay needs an auxiliary power supply to work  this power source can be either direct current  commonly  batteries inside the switchgear  or alternate current  commonly 48-230 vac   some relays include an  extended  power input to accept both ac and dc with the same hardware  this relays use the operation current of the installation  the same current transformers that are needed to measure the line current are also used for powering on the device  the main advantage of these type of relays is that no external power source is needed  so it reduces costs and maintenance   some of the self-powered relays can be also auxiliary powered  so all batteries  chargers and other external elements are made redundant and used as a backup  when the substation is up and running  they will use the current from the line  if there is a fault and the substation goes down  the relay will trigger the striker but will stay on using batteries  if any  when the technicians arrive to the substation  they can check in the relay the fault event and act over the relay  it has also the advantage that when commissioning  the relay can be configured using an external power source before the substation is operative
