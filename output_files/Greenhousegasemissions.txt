Greenhousegasemissions
 a greenhouse gas  abbrev  ghg  is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range  this process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect  1  the primary greenhouse gases in earth s atmosphere are water vapor  carbon dioxide  methane  nitrous oxide  and ozone  without greenhouse gases  the average temperature of earth s surface would be about \u221218\xa0\xb0c (0\xa0\xb0f   2  rather than the present average of 15\xa0\xb0c (59\xa0\xb0f   3][4][5  in the solar system  the atmospheres of venus  mars and titan also contain gases that cause a greenhouse effect   human activities since the beginning of the industrial revolution  taken as the year 1750  have produced a 40  increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide  from 280 ppm in 1750 to 400 ppm in 2015.[6][7  this increase has occurred despite the uptake of a large portion of the emissions by various natural  sinks  involved in the carbon cycle  8][9  anthropogenic carbon dioxide (co2  emissions  i e   emissions produced by human activities  come from combustion of fossil fuels  principally coal  oil  and natural gas  along with deforestation  soil erosion and animal agriculture  10   it has been estimated that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the present rate  earth s surface temperature could exceed historical values as early as 2047  with potentially harmful effects on ecosystems  biodiversity and the livelihoods of people worldwide  11  recent estimates suggest that on the current emissions trajectory the earth could pass a threshold of 2\xa0\xb0c global warming  which the united nations  ipcc designated as the upper limit to avoid  dangerous  global warming  by 2036.[12   greenhouse gases are those that absorb and emit infrared radiation in the wavelength range emitted by earth  1  in order  the most abundant greenhouse gases in earth s atmosphere are   atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are determined by the balance between sources  emissions of the gas from human activities and natural systems  and sinks  the removal of the gas from the atmosphere by conversion to a different chemical compound   13  the proportion of an emission remaining in the atmosphere after a specified time is the  airborne fraction   af   the annual airborne fraction is the ratio of the atmospheric increase in a given year to that year s total emissions  over the last 50 years (1956\u20132006  the annual airborne fraction for co2 has been increasing at 0.25\xa0\xb1\xa00.21%/year  14   the major atmospheric constituents  nitrogen (n n2   oxygen (o n2   and argon  ar   are not greenhouse gases because molecules containing two atoms of the same element such as n n2 and o n2 and monatomic molecules such as argon  ar  have no net change in the distribution of their electrical charges when they vibrate and hence are almost totally unaffected by infrared radiation  although molecules containing two atoms of different elements such as carbon monoxide  co  or hydrogen chloride  hcl  absorb infrared radiation  these molecules are short-lived in the atmosphere owing to their reactivity and solubility  therefore  they do not contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect and usually are omitted when discussing greenhouse gases   some gases have indirect radiative effects  whether or not they are greenhouse gases themselves   this happens in two main ways  one way is that when they break down in the atmosphere they produce another greenhouse gas  for example  methane and carbon monoxide  co  are oxidized to give carbon dioxide  and methane oxidation also produces water vapor  that will be considered below   oxidation of co to co2 directly produces an unambiguous increase in radiative forcing although the reason is subtle  the peak of the thermal ir emission from earth s surface is very close to a strong vibrational absorption band of co2 (667\xa0cm u22121   on the other hand  the single co vibrational band only absorbs ir at much higher frequencies (2145\xa0cm u22121   where the ~300\xa0k thermal emission of the surface is at least a factor of ten lower  oxidation of methane to co2  which requires reactions with the oh radical  produces an instantaneous reduction  since co2 is a weaker greenhouse gas than methane  but it has a longer lifetime  as described below this is not the whole story  since the oxidations of co and ch n4 are intertwined by both consuming oh radicals  in any case  the calculation of the total radiative effect needs to include both the direct and indirect forcing   a second type of indirect effect happens when chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving these gases change the concentrations of greenhouse gases  for example  the destruction of non-methane volatile organic compounds  nmvocs  in the atmosphere can produce ozone  the size of the indirect effect can depend strongly on where and when the gas is emitted  16   methane has a number of indirect effects in addition to forming co2  first  the main chemical that destroys methane in the atmosphere is the hydroxyl radical  oh   methane reacts with oh and so more methane means that the concentration of oh goes down  effectively  methane increases its own atmospheric lifetime and therefore its overall radiative effect  the second effect is that the oxidation of methane can produce ozone  third  as well as making co2 the oxidation of methane produces water  this is a major source of water vapor in the stratosphere  which is otherwise very dry  co and nmvoc also produce co2 when they are oxidized  they remove oh from the atmosphere and this leads to higher concentrations of methane  the surprising effect of this is that the global warming potential of co is three times that of co2.[17  the same process that converts nmvoc to carbon dioxide can also lead to the formation of tropospheric ozone  halocarbons have an indirect effect because they destroy stratospheric ozone  finally hydrogen can lead to ozone production and ch n4 increases as well as producing water vapor in the stratosphere  16   the major non-gas contributor to earth s greenhouse effect  clouds  also absorb and emit infrared radiation and thus have an effect on radiative properties of the greenhouse gases  clouds are water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere  18][19   the contribution of each gas to the greenhouse effect is determined by the characteristics of that gas  its abundance  and any indirect effects it may cause  for example  the direct radiative effect of a mass of methane is about 72 times stronger than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame 22  but it is present in much smaller concentrations so that its total direct radiative effect is smaller  in part due to its shorter atmospheric lifetime  on the other hand  in addition to its direct radiative impact  methane has a large  indirect radiative effect because it contributes to ozone formation  shindell et al  (2005)[23  argue that the contribution to climate change from methane is at least double previous estimates as a result of this effect  24   when ranked by their direct contribution to the greenhouse effect  the most important are  18  not in citation given    a  water vapor strongly varies locally 26  n b  the concentration in stratosphere  about 90  of the ozone in earth s atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere   in addition to the main greenhouse gases listed above  other greenhouse gases include sulfur hexafluoride  hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons  see ipcc list of greenhouse gases   some greenhouse gases are not often listed  for example  nitrogen trifluoride has a high global warming potential  gwp  but is only present in very small quantities  27   it is not possible to state that a certain gas causes an exact percentage of the greenhouse effect  this is because some of the gases absorb and emit radiation at the same frequencies as others  so that the total greenhouse effect is not simply the sum of the influence of each gas  the higher ends of the ranges quoted are for each gas alone  the lower ends account for overlaps with the other gases  18][19  in addition  some gases such as methane are known to have large indirect effects that are still being quantified  28   aside from water vapor  which has a residence time of about nine days  29  major greenhouse gases are well mixed and take many years to leave the atmosphere  30  although it is not easy to know with precision how long it takes greenhouse gases to leave the atmosphere  there are estimates for the principal greenhouse gases  jacob (1999)[31  defines the lifetime \n n n n u03c4 n n n   displaystyle   tau   n n of an atmospheric species x in a one-box model as the average time that a molecule of x remains in the box  mathematically \n n n n u03c4 n n n   displaystyle   tau   n n can be defined as the ratio of the

concentration would be about halved   the atmospheric lifetime of a species therefore measures the time required to restore equilibrium following a sudden increase or decrease in its concentration in the atmosphere  individual atoms or molecules may be lost or deposited to sinks such as the soil  the oceans and other waters  or vegetation and other biological systems  reducing the excess to background concentrations  the average time taken to achieve this is the mean lifetime   carbon dioxide has a variable atmospheric lifetime  and cannot be specified precisely  32  the atmospheric lifetime of co2 is estimated of the order of 30\u201395 years  33  this figure accounts for co2 molecules being removed from the atmosphere by mixing into the ocean  photosynthesis  and other processes  however  this excludes the balancing fluxes of co2 into the atmosphere from the geological reservoirs  which have slower characteristic rates  34  although more than half of the co2 emitted is removed from the atmosphere within a century  some fraction  about 20   of emitted co2 remains in the atmosphere for many thousands of years  35  [36  [37  similar issues apply to other greenhouse gases  many of which have longer mean lifetimes than co2  e g   n2o has a mean atmospheric lifetime of 114 years  22   earth absorbs some of the radiant energy received from the sun  reflects some of it as light and reflects or radiates the rest back to space as heat  38  earth s surface temperature depends on this balance between incoming and outgoing energy  38  if this energy balance is shifted  earth s surface could become warmer or cooler  leading to a variety of changes in global climate  38   a number of natural and man-made mechanisms can affect the global energy balance and force changes in earth s climate  38  greenhouse gases are one such mechanism  38  greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit some of the outgoing energy radiated from earth s surface  causing that heat to be retained in the lower atmosphere  38  as explained above  some greenhouse gases remain in the atmosphere for decades or even centuries  and therefore can affect earth s energy balance over a long time period  38  factors that influence earth s energy balance can be quantified in terms of  radiative climate forcing   38  positive radiative forcing indicates warming  for example  by increasing incoming energy or decreasing the amount of energy that escapes to space   whereas negative forcing is associated with cooling  38   the global warming potential  gwp  depends on both the efficiency of the molecule as a greenhouse gas and its atmospheric lifetime  gwp is measured relative to the same mass of co2 and evaluated for a specific timescale  thus  if a gas has a high  positive  radiative forcing but also a short lifetime  it will have a large gwp on a 20-year scale but a small one on a 100-year scale  conversely  if a molecule has a longer atmospheric lifetime than co2 its gwp will increase with the timescale considered  carbon dioxide is defined to have a gwp of 1 over all time periods   methane has an atmospheric lifetime of 12 \xb1 3 years  the 2007 ipcc report lists the gwp as 72 over a time scale of 20 years  25 over 100 years and 7.6 over 500 years  22  a 2014 analysis  however  states that although methane s initial impact is about 100 times greater than that of co2  because of the shorter atmospheric lifetime  after six or seven decades  the impact of the two gases is about equal  and from then on methane s relative role continues to decline  39  the decrease in gwp at longer times is because methane is degraded to water and co2 through chemical reactions in the atmosphere   examples of the atmospheric lifetime and gwp relative to co2 for several greenhouse gases are given in the following table  22   the use of cfc-12  except some essential uses  has been phased out due to its ozone depleting properties  40  the phasing-out of less active hcfc-compounds will be completed in 2030.[41   aside from purely human-produced synthetic halocarbons  most greenhouse gases have both natural and human-caused sources  during the pre-industrial holocene  concentrations of existing gases were roughly constant  in the industrial era  human activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere  mainly through the burning of fossil fuels and clearing of forests  46][47   the 2007 fourth assessment report compiled by the ipcc (ar4  noted that  changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols  land cover and solar radiation alter the energy balance of the climate system   and concluded that  increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations is very likely to have caused most of the increases in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century   48  in ar4   most of  is defined as more than 50    abbreviations used in the two tables below  ppm   parts-per-million  ppb   parts-per-billion  ppt   parts-per-trillion  w m2   watts per square metre  ice cores provide evidence for greenhouse gas concentration variations over the past 800,000 years  see the following section   both co2 and ch n4 vary between glacial and interglacial phases  and concentrations of these gases correlate strongly with temperature  direct data does not exist for periods earlier than those represented in the ice core record  a record that indicates co2 mole fractions stayed within a range of 180\xa0ppm to 280\xa0ppm throughout the last 800,000 years  until the increase of the last 250 years  however  various proxies and modeling suggests larger variations in past epochs  500 million years ago co2 levels were likely 10 times higher than now  59  indeed  higher co2 concentrations are thought to have prevailed throughout most of the phanerozoic eon  with concentrations four to six times current concentrations during the mesozoic era  and ten to fifteen times current concentrations during the early palaeozoic era until the middle of the devonian period  about 400 ma  60][61][62  the spread of land plants is thought to have reduced co2 concentrations during the late devonian  and plant activities as both sources and sinks of co2 have since been important in providing stabilising feedbacks  63  earlier still  a 200-million year period of intermittent  widespread glaciation extending close to the equator  snowball earth  appears to have been ended suddenly  about 550 ma  by a colossal volcanic outgassing that raised the co2 concentration of the atmosphere abruptly to 12   about 350 times modern levels  causing extreme greenhouse conditions and carbonate deposition as limestone at the rate of about 1\xa0mm per day  64  this episode marked the close of the precambrian eon  and was succeeded by the generally warmer conditions of the phanerozoic  during which multicellular animal and plant life evolved  no volcanic carbon dioxide emission of comparable scale has occurred since  in the modern era  emissions to the atmosphere from volcanoes are only about 1  of emissions from human sources  64][65][66   measurements from antarctic ice cores show that before industrial emissions started atmospheric co2 mole fractions were about 280 parts per million  ppm   and stayed between 260 and 280 during the preceding ten thousand years  67  carbon dioxide mole fractions in the atmosphere have gone up by approximately 35 percent since the 1900s  rising from 280 parts per million by volume to 387 parts per million in 2009  one study using evidence from stomata of fossilized leaves suggests greater variability  with carbon dioxide mole fractions above 300\xa0ppm during the period seven to ten thousand years ago  68  though others have argued that these findings more likely reflect calibration or contamination problems rather than actual co2 variability  69][70  because of the way air is trapped in ice  pores in the ice close off slowly to form bubbles deep within the firn  and the time period represented in each ice sample analyzed  these figures represent averages of atmospheric concentrations of up to a few centuries rather than annual or decadal levels   since the beginning of the industrial revolution  the concentrations of most of the greenhouse gases have increased  for example  the mole fraction of carbon dioxide has increased from 280\xa0ppm by about 36  to 380\xa0ppm  or 100\xa0ppm over modern pre-industrial levels  the first 50\xa0ppm increase took place in about 200 years  from the start of the industrial revolution to around 1973  citation needed   however the next 50\xa0ppm increase took place in about 33 years  from 1973 to 2006.[71   recent data also shows that the concentration is increasing at a higher rate  in the 1960s  the average annual increase was only 37  of what it was in 2000 through 2007.[72   today  the stock of carbon in the atmosphere increases by more than 3 million tonnes per annum (0.04   compared with the existing stock  clarification needed  this increase is the result of human activities by burning fossil fuels  deforestation and forest degradation in tropical and boreal regions  73   the other greenhouse gases produced from human activity show similar increases in both amount and rate of increase  many observations are available online in a variety of atmospheric chemistry observational databases   since about 1750 human activity has increased the concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  measured atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are currently 100\xa0ppm higher than pre-industrial levels  76  natural sources of carbon dioxide are more than 20 times greater than sources due to human activity  77  but over periods longer than a few years natural sources are closely balanced by natural sinks  mainly photosynthesis of carbon compounds by plants and marine plankton  as a result of this balance  the atmospheric mole fraction of carbon dioxide remained between 260 and 280 parts per million for the 10,000 years between the end of the last glacial maximum and the start of the industrial era  78   it is likely that anthropogenic  i e   human-induced  warming  such as that due to elevated greenhouse gas levels  has had a discernible influence on many physical and biological systems  79  future warming is projected to have a range of impacts  including sea level rise  80  increased frequencies and severities of some extreme weather events  80  loss of biodiversity  81  and regional changes in agricultural productivity  81   the main sources of greenhouse gases due to human activity are   the seven sources of co2 from fossil fuel combustion are  with percentage contributions for 2000\u20132004):[84   carbon dioxide  methane  nitrous oxide (n n2o  and three groups of fluorinated gases  sulfur hexafluoride (sf n6   hydrofluorocarbons  hfcs   and perfluorocarbons  pfcs   are the major anthropogenic greenhouse gases  86]:147[87  and are regulated under the kyoto protocol international treaty  which came into force in 2005.[88  emissions limitations specified in the kyoto protocol expired in 2012.[88  the canc xfan agreement  agreed in 2010  includes voluntary pledges made by 76 countries to control emissions  89  at the time of the agreement  these 76 countries were collectively responsible for 85  of annual global emissions  89   although cfcs are greenhouse gases  they are regulated by the montreal protocol  which was motivated by cfcs  contribution to ozone depletion rather than by their contribution to global warming  note that ozone depletion has only a minor role in greenhouse warming though the two processes often are confused in the media  on 15 october 2016  negotiators from over 170 nations meeting at the summit of the united nations environment programme reached a legally binding accord to phase out hydrofluorocarbons  hfcs  in an amendment to the montreal protocol  90][91][92   according to unep global tourism is closely linked to climate change  tourism is a significant contributor to the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  tourism accounts for about 50  of traffic movements  rapidly expanding air traffic contributes about 2.5  of the production of co2  the number of international travelers is expected to increase from 594 million in 1996 to 1.6 billion by 2020  adding greatly to the problem unless steps are taken to reduce emissions  93   the road haulage industry plays a part in production of co2  contributing around 20  of the uk s total carbon emissions a year  with only the energy industry having a larger impact at around 39%.[94  average carbon emissions within the haulage industry are falling u2014in the thirty-year period from 1977 to 2007  the carbon emissions associated with a 200-mile journey fell by 21 percent  nox emissions are also down 87 percent  whereas journey times have fallen by around a third  95  due to their size  hgvs often receive criticism regarding their co2 emissions  however  rapid development in engine technology and fuel management is having a largely positive effect   water vapor accounts for the largest percentage of the greenhouse effect  between 36  and 66  for clear sky conditions and between 66  and 85  when including clouds  19  water vapor concentrations fluctuate regionally  but human activity does not directly affect water vapor concentrations except at local scales  such as near irrigated fields  indirectly  human activity that increases global temperatures will increase water vapor concentrations  a process known as water vapor feedback  96  the atmospheric concentration of vapor is highly variable and depends largely on temperature  from less than 0.01  in extremely cold regions up to 3  by mass in saturated air at about 32\xa0\xb0c  97   see relative humidity other important facts    the average residence time of a water molecule in the atmosphere is only about nine days  compared to years or centuries for other greenhouse gases such as ch n4 and co2.[98  thus  water vapor responds to and amplifies effects of the other greenhouse gases  the clausius u2013clapeyron relation establishes that more water vapor will be present per unit volume at elevated temperatures  this and other basic principles indicate that warming associated with increased concentrations of the other greenhouse gases also will increase the concentration of water vapor  assuming that the relative humidity remains approximately constant  modeling and observational studies find that this is indeed so   because water vapor is a greenhouse gas  this results in further warming and so is a  positive feedback  that amplifies the original warming  eventually other earth processes offset these positive feedbacks  stabilizing the global temperature at a new equilibrium and preventing the loss of earth s water through a venus-like runaway greenhouse effect  99   between the period 1970 to 2004  ghg emissions  measured in co2-equivalent  100  increased at an average rate of 1.6  per year  with co2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels growing at a rate of 1.9  per year  101][102  total anthropogenic emissions at the end of 2009 were estimated at 49.5 gigatonnes co2-equivalent  103]:15 these emissions include co2 from fossil fuel use and from land use  as well as emissions of methane  nitrous oxide and other ghgs covered by the kyoto protocol   at present  the primary source of co2 emissions is the burning of coal  natural gas  and petroleum for electricity and heat  104   there are several different ways of measuring ghg emissions  for example  see world bank (2010)[105]:362 for tables of national emissions data  some variables that have been reported 106  include   these different measures are sometimes used by different countries to assert various policy ethical positions on climate change  banuri et al   1996  p  xa094).[107  this use of different measures leads to a lack of comparability  which is problematic when monitoring progress towards targets  there are arguments for the adoption of a common measurement tool  or at least the development of communication between different tools  106   emissions may be measured over long time periods  this measurement type is called historical or cumulative emissions  cumulative emissions give some indication of who is responsible for the build-up in the atmospheric concentration of ghgs  iea  2007  p  xa0199).[108   the national accounts balance would be positively related to carbon emissions  the national accounts balance shows the difference between exports and imports  for many richer nations  such as the united states  the accounts balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported  this is mostly due to the fact that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries  leading the economies of developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods  we believed that a positive accounts balance would means that more production was occurring in a country  so more factories working would increase carbon emission levels  holtz-eakin  1995  pp  85;101).[109   emissions may also be measured across shorter time periods  emissions changes may  for example  be measured against a base year of 1990  1990 was used in the united nations framework convention on climate change  unfccc  as the base year for emissions  and is also used in the kyoto protocol  some gases are also measured from the year 1995).[86]:146,149 a country s emissions may also be reported as a proportion of global emissions for a particular year   another measurement is of per capita emissions  this divides a country s total annual emissions by its mid-year population  105]:370 per capita emissions may be based on historical or annual emissions  banuri et al   1996  pp  xa0106\u2013107).[107   land-use change  e g   the clearing of forests for agricultural use  can affect the concentration of ghgs in the atmosphere by altering how much carbon flows out of the atmosphere into carbon sinks  110  accounting for land-use change can be understood as an attempt to measure  net  emissions  i e   gross emissions from all ghg sources minus the removal of emissions from the atmosphere by carbon sinks  banuri et al   1996  pp  xa092\u201393).[107   there are substantial uncertainties in the measurement of net carbon emissions  111  additionally  there is controversy over how carbon sinks should be allocated between different regions and over time  banuri et al   1996  p  xa093).[107  for instance  concentrating on more recent changes in carbon sinks is likely to favour those regions that have deforested earlier  e g   europe   greenhouse gas intensity is a ratio between greenhouse gas emissions and another metric  e g   gross domestic product  gdp  or energy use  the terms  carbon intensity  and  emissions intensity  are also sometimes used  112  ghg intensities may be calculated using market exchange rates  mer  or purchasing power parity  ppp   banuri et al   1996  p  xa096).[107  calculations based on mer show large differences in intensities between developed and developing countries  whereas calculations based on ppp show smaller differences   cumulative anthropogenic  i e   human-emitted  emissions of co2 from fossil fuel use are a major cause of global warming  113  and give some indication of which countries have contributed most to human-induced climate change  114]:15  the table above to the left is based on banuri et al  (1996  p  xa094).[107  overall  developed countries accounted for 83.8  of industrial co2 emissions over this time period  and 67.8  of total co2 emissions  developing countries accounted for industrial co2 emissions of 16.2  over this time period  and 32.2  of total co2 emissions  the estimate of total co2 emissions includes biotic carbon emissions  mainly from deforestation  banuri et al  (1996  p  xa094)[107  calculated per capita cumulative emissions based on then-current population  the ratio in per capita emissions between industrialized countries and developing countries was estimated at more than 10 to 1   including biotic emissions brings about the same controversy mentioned earlier regarding carbon sinks and land-use change  banuri et al   1996  pp  xa093\u201394).[107  the actual calculation of net emissions is very complex  and is affected by how carbon sinks are allocated between regions and the dynamics of the climate system   non-oecd countries accounted for 42  of cumulative energy-related co2 emissions between 1890 and 2007.[115]:179\u2013180 over this time period  the us accounted for 28  of emissions  the eu  23   russia  11   china  9   other oecd countries  5   japan  4   india  3   and the rest of the world  18%.[115]:179\u2013180  between 1970 and 2004  global growth in annual co2 emissions was driven by north america  asia  and the middle east  116  the sharp acceleration in co2 emissions since 2000 to more than a 3  increase per year  more than 2\xa0ppm per year  from 1.1  per year during the 1990s is attributable to the lapse of formerly declining trends in carbon intensity of both developing and developed nations  china was responsible for most of global growth in emissions during this period  localised plummeting emissions associated with the collapse of the soviet union have been followed by slow emissions growth in this region due to more efficient energy use  made necessary by the increasing proportion of it that is exported  84  in comparison  methane has not increased appreciably  and n n2o by 0.25  y u22121   using different base years for measuring emissions has an effect on estimates of national contributions to global warming  114]:17\u201318[117  this can be calculated by dividing a country s highest contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year  by that country s minimum contribution to global warming starting from a particular base year  choosing between different base years of 1750  1900  1950  and 1990 has a significant effect for most countries  114]:17\u201318 within the g8 group of countries  it is most significant for the uk  france and germany  these countries have a long history of co2 emissions  see the section on cumulative and historical emissions    annual per capita emissions in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries  86]:144 due to china s fast economic development  its annual per capita emissions are quickly approaching the levels of those in the annex i group of the kyoto protocol  i e   the developed countries excluding the usa   118  other countries with fast growing emissions are south korea  iran  and australia  which apart from the oil rich persian gulf states  now has the highest percapita emission rate in the world   on the other hand  annual per capita emissions of the eu-15 and the usa are gradually decreasing over time  118  emissions in russia and ukraine have decreased fastest since 1990 due to economic restructuring in these countries  119   energy statistics for fast growing economies are less accurate than those for the industrialized countries  for china s annual emissions in 2008  the netherlands environmental assessment agency estimated an uncertainty range of about 10%.[118   the ghg footprint  or greenhouse gas footprint  refers to the amount of ghg that are emitted during the creation of products or services  it is more comprehensive than the commonly used carbon footprint  which measures only carbon dioxide  one of many greenhouse gases   2015 was the first year to see both total global economic growth and a reduction of carbon emissions  120   in 2009  the annual top ten emitting countries accounted for about two-thirds of the world s annual energy-related co2 emissions  121   one way of attributing greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions is to measure the embedded emissions  also referred to as  embodied emissions   of goods that are being consumed  emissions are usually measured according to production  rather than consumption  122  for example  in the main international treaty on climate change  the unfccc   countries report on emissions produced within their borders  e g   the emissions produced from burning fossil fuels  115]:179[123]:1 under a production-based accounting of emissions  embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the exporting  rather than the importing  country  under a consumption-based accounting of emissions  embedded emissions on imported goods are attributed to the importing country  rather than the exporting  country   davis and caldeira (2010)[123]:4 found that a substantial proportion of co2 emissions are traded internationally  the net effect of trade was to export emissions from china and other emerging markets to consumers in the us  japan  and western europe  based on annual emissions data from the year 2004  and on a per-capita consumption basis  the top-5 emitting countries were found to be  in tco2 per person  per year   luxembourg (34.7   the us (22.0   singapore (20.2   australia (16.7   and canada

work by the intergovernmental panel on climate change  125  international energy agency  126][127  and united nations environment programme  128  policies implemented by governments have included 129][130][131  national and regional targets to reduce emissions  promoting energy efficiency  and support for renewable energy such as solar energy as an effective use of renewable energy because solar uses energy from the sun and does not release pollutants into the air   countries and regions listed in annex i of the united nations framework convention on climate change  unfccc   i e   the oecd and former planned economies of the soviet union  are required to submit periodic assessments to the unfccc of actions they are taking to address climate change  131]:3 analysis by the unfccc (2011)[131]:8 suggested that policies and measures undertaken by annex i parties may have produced emission savings of 1.5 thousand tg co2-eq in the year 2010  with most savings made in the energy sector  the projected emissions saving of 1.5 thousand tg co2-eq is measured against a hypothetical  baseline  of annex i emissions  i e   projected annex i emissions in the absence of policies and measures  the total projected annex i saving of 1.5 thousand co2-eq does not include emissions savings in seven of the annex i parties  131]:8  a wide range of projections of future ghg emissions have been produced  132  rogner et al  (2007)[133  assessed the scientific literature on ghg projections  rogner et al  (2007)[101  concluded that unless energy policies changed substantially  the world would continue to depend on fossil fuels until 2025\u20132030  projections suggest that more than 80  of the world s energy will come from fossil fuels  this conclusion was based on  much evidence  and  high agreement  in the literature  101  projected annual energy-related co2 emissions in 2030 were 40\u2013110  higher than in 2000  with two-thirds of the increase originating in developing

136][137][138   a literature review of numerous energy sources co2 emissions by the ipcc in 2011  found that  the co2 emission value that fell within the 50th percentile of all total life cycle emissions studies conducted was as follows  140   greenhouse gases can be removed from the atmosphere by various processes  as a consequence of   a number of technologies remove greenhouse gases emissions from the atmosphere  most widely analysed are those that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  either to geologic formations such as bio-energy with carbon capture and storage 141][142][143  and carbon dioxide air capture  143  or to the soil as in the case with biochar  143  the ipcc has pointed out that many long-term climate scenario models require large-scale manmade negative emissions to avoid serious climate change  144   in the late 19th century scientists experimentally discovered that n n2 and o n2 do not absorb infrared radiation  called  at that time   dark radiation    while water  both as true vapor and condensed in the form of microscopic droplets suspended in clouds  and co2 and other poly-atomic gaseous molecules do absorb infrared radiation  in the early 20th century researchers realized that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere made earth s overall temperature higher than it would be without them  during the late 20th century  a scientific consensus evolved that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere cause a substantial rise in global temperatures and changes to other parts of the climate system  145  with consequences for the environment and for human health
