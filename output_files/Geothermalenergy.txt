Geothermalenergy
 geothermal energy is heat energy generated and stored in the earth  thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter  the geothermal energy of the earth s crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials  in currently uncertain 1  but possibly roughly equal 2  proportions   the geothermal gradient  which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface  drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface  the adjective geothermal originates from the greek roots \u03b3\u03b7  ge   meaning earth  and \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc u03bf u03c2  thermos   meaning hot   earth s internal heat is thermal energy generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from earth s formation  3  temperatures at the core u2013mantle boundary may reach over 4000\xa0\xb0c (7,200\xa0\xb0f   4  the high temperature and pressure in earth s interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically  resulting in portions of mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock  rock and water is heated in the crust  sometimes up to 370\xa0\xb0c (700\xa0\xb0f   5   from hot springs  geothermal energy has been used for bathing since paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient roman times  but it is now better known for electricity generation  worldwide  11,700 megawatts  mw  of geothermal power is online in 2013.[6  an additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district heating  space heating  spas  industrial processes  desalination and agricultural applications in 2010.[7   geothermal power is cost-effective  reliable  sustainable  and environmentally friendly  8  but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries  recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources  especially for applications such as home heating  opening a potential for widespread exploitation  geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth  but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels  as a result  geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels   the earth s geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity s energy needs  but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited  drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive  forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology  energy prices  subsidies  plate boundary movement and interest rates  pilot programs like eweb s customer opt in green power program 9  show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal  but as a result of government assisted research and industry experience  the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25  over the past two decades  10  in 2001  geothermal energy costs between two and ten us cents per kwh  11       hot springs have been used for bathing at least since paleolithic times  12  the oldest known spa is a stone pool on china s lisan mountain built in the qin dynasty in the 3rd century bc  at the same site where the huaqing chi palace was later built  in the first century ad  romans conquered aquae sulis  now bath  somerset  england  and used the hot springs there to feed public baths and underfloor heating  the admission fees for these baths probably represent the first commercial use of geothermal power  the world s oldest geothermal district heating system in chaudes-aigues  france  has been operating since the 14th century  13  the earliest industrial exploitation began in 1827 with the use of geyser steam to extract boric acid from volcanic mud in larderello  italy   in 1892  america s first district heating system in boise  idaho was powered directly by geothermal energy  and was copied in klamath falls  oregon in 1900  the first known building in the world to utilize geothermal energy as its primary heat source was the hot lake hotel in union county  oregon  whose construction was completed in 1907.[14  a deep geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in boise in 1926  and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in iceland and tuscany at about the same time  15  charlie lieb developed the first downhole heat exchanger in 1930 to heat his house  steam and hot water from geysers began heating homes in iceland starting in 1943   in the 20th century  demand for electricity led to the consideration of geothermal power as a generating source  prince piero ginori conti tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 july 1904  at the same larderello dry steam field where geothermal acid extraction began  it successfully lit four light bulbs  17  later  in 1911  the world s first commercial geothermal power plant was built there  it was the world s only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until new zealand built a plant in 1958  in 2012  it produced some 594 megawatts  18   lord kelvin invented the heat pump in 1852  and heinrich zoelly had patented the idea of using it to draw heat from the ground in 1912.[19  but it was not until the late 1940s that the geothermal heat pump was successfully implemented  the earliest one was probably robert c  webber s home-made 2.2\xa0kw direct-exchange system  but sources disagree as to the exact timeline of his invention  19  j  donald kroeker designed the first commercial geothermal heat pump to heat the commonwealth building  portland  oregon  and demonstrated it in 1946.[20][21  professor carl nielsen of ohio state university built the first residential open loop version in his home in 1948.[22  the technology became popular in sweden as a result of the 1973 oil crisis  and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then  the 1979 development of polybutylene pipe greatly augmented the heat pump u2019s economic viability  20   in 1960  pacific gas and electric began operation of the first successful geothermal electric power plant in the united states at the geysers in california  23  the original turbine lasted for more than 30\xa0years and produced 11\xa0mw net power  24   the binary cycle power plant was first demonstrated in 1967 in the ussr and later introduced to the us in 1981.[23  this technology allows the generation of electricity from much lower temperature resources than previously  in 2006  a binary cycle plant in chena hot springs  alaska  came on-line  producing electricity from a record low fluid temperature of 57\xa0\xb0c (135\xa0\xb0f   25   [26   the international geothermal association  iga  has reported that 10,715 megawatts  mw  of geothermal power in 24 countries is online  which was expected to generate 67,246 gwh of electricity in 2010.[27  this represents a 20  increase in online capacity since 2005  iga projects growth to 18,500 mw by 2015  due to the projects presently under consideration  often in areas previously assumed to have little exploitable resource  27   in 2010  the united states led the world in geothermal electricity production with 3,086 mw of installed capacity from 77 power plants  28  the largest group of geothermal power plants in the world is located at the geysers  a geothermal field in california  29  the philippines is the second highest producer  with 1,904 mw of capacity online  geothermal power makes up approximately 27  of philippine electricity generation  28   in 2016  indonesia set in third with 1,647 mw online behind usa at 3,450 mw and the philippines at 1,870 mw  but indonesia will becomes second due to additional online 130 mw at end of 2016 and 255 mw in 2017  due to indonesia has 28,994 mw reserve as the largest geothermal reserve in the world  so predicted indonesia will tumble usa in the next decade  30   geothermal electric plants were traditionally built exclusively on the edges of tectonic plates where high temperature geothermal resources are available near the surface  the development of binary cycle power plants and improvements in drilling and extraction technology enable enhanced geothermal systems over a much greater geographical range  32  demonstration projects are operational in landau-pfalz  germany  and soultz-sous-for xeats  france  while an earlier effort in basel  switzerland was shut down after it triggered earthquakes  other demonstration projects are under construction in australia  the united kingdom  and the united states of america  33   the thermal efficiency of geothermal electric plants is low  around 10\u201323   because geothermal fluids do not reach the high temperatures of steam from boilers  the laws of thermodynamics limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy  exhaust heat is wasted  unless it can be used directly and locally  for example in greenhouses  timber mills  and district heating  system efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel  but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant  in order to produce more energy than the pumps consume  electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles  citation needed  because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy  unlike  for example  wind or solar  its capacity factor can be quite large \u2013 up to 96  has been demonstrated  34  the global average was 73  in 2005   geothermal energy comes in either vapor-dominated or liquid-dominated forms  larderello and the geysers are vapor-dominated  vapor-dominated sites offer temperatures from 240 to 300\xa0\xb0c that produce superheated steam   liquid-dominated reservoirs  ldrs  were more common with temperatures greater than 200\xa0\xb0c (392\xa0\xb0f  and are found near young volcanoes surrounding the pacific ocean and in rift zones and hot spots  flash plants are the common way to generate electricity from these sources  pumps are generally not required  powered instead when the water turns to steam  most wells generate 2-10mwe  steam is separated from liquid via cyclone separators  while the liquid is returned to the reservoir for reheating reuse  as of 2013  the largest liquid system is cerro prieto in mexico  which generates 750 mwe from temperatures reaching 350\xa0\xb0c (662\xa0\xb0f   the salton sea field in southern california offers the potential of generating 2000 mwe  18   lower temperature ldrs (120\u2013200\xa0\xb0c  require pumping  they are common in extensional terrains  where heating takes place via deep circulation along faults  such as in the western us and turkey  water passes through a heat exchanger in a rankine cycle binary plant  the water vaporizes an organic working fluid that drives a turbine  these binary plants originated in the soviet union in the late 1960s and predominate in new us plants  binary plants have no emissions  18][35   lower temperature sources produce the energy equivalent of 100m bbl per year  sources with temperatures of 30\u2013150\xa0\xb0c are used without conversion to electricity as district heating  greenhouses  fisheries  mineral recovery  industrial process heating and bathing in 75 countries  heat pumps extract energy from shallow sources at 10\u201320\xa0\xb0c in 43 countries for use in space heating and cooling  home heating is the fastest-growing means of exploiting geothermal energy  with global annual growth rate of 30  in 2005[36  and 20  in 2012.[18][35   approximately 270\xa0petajoules xa0 pj  of geothermal heating was used in 2004  more than half went for space heating  and another third for heated pools  the remainder supported industrial and agricultural applications  global installed capacity was 28\xa0gw  but capacity factors tend to be low (30  on average  since heat is mostly needed in winter  some 88\xa0pj for space heating was extracted by an estimated 1.3\xa0million geothermal heat pumps with a total capacity of 15 gw  7   heat for these purposes may also be extracted from co-generation at a geothermal electrical plant   heating is cost-effective at many more sites than electricity generation  at natural hot springs or geysers  water can be piped directly into radiators  in hot  dry ground  earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat  however  even in areas where the ground is colder than room temperature  heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces  37  these devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques  they frequently combine functions  including air conditioning  seasonal thermal energy storage  solar energy collection  and electric heating  heat pumps can be used for space heating essentially anywhere   iceland is the world leader in direct applications  some 92.5  of its homes are heated with geothermal energy  saving iceland over $100 million annually in avoided oil imports  reykjav xedk  iceland has the world s biggest district heating system  often used to heat pathways and roads to hinder the accumulation of ice  38  once known as the most polluted city in the world  it is now one of the cleanest  39   enhanced geothermal systems  egs  actively inject water into wells to be heated and pumped back out  the water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures to enable the water to freely flow in and out  the technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques  however  the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used  reducing the possibility of environmental damage  drillers can employ directional drilling to expand the size of the reservoir  18   small-scale egs have been installed in the rhine graben at soultz-sous-for xeats in france and at landau and insheim in germany  18   geothermal power requires no fuel  except for pumps   and is therefore immune to fuel cost fluctuations  however  capital costs are significant  drilling accounts for over half the costs  and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks  a typical well doublet  extraction and injection wells  in nevada can support 4.5 megawatts  mw  and costs about $10\xa0million to drill  with a 20  failure rate  40   in total  electrical plant construction and well drilling cost about \u20ac2\u20135\xa0million xa0 per xa0mw of electrical capacity  while the break u2013even price is 0.04\u20130.10\xa0\u20ac per xa0kw xb7h  16  enhanced geothermal systems tend to be on the high side of these ranges  with capital costs above $4\xa0million per xa0mw and break u2013even above $0.054 per xa0kw xb7h in 2007.[41  direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures  so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible  residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10\xa0kilowatt  kw  are routinely installed for around $1\u20133,000 per xa0kilowatt  district heating systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense  as in cities and greenhouses  but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs  the capital cost of one such district heating system in bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1\xa0million xa0\u20ac per xa0mw  42  direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs per xa0kw xb7h  but they must consume electricity to run pumps and compressors  some governments subsidize geothermal projects   geothermal power is highly scalable  from a rural village to an entire city  43   the most developed geothermal field in the united states is the geysers in northern california  44   geothermal projects have several stages of development  each phase has associated risks  at the early stages of reconnaissance and geophysical surveys  many projects are cancelled  making that phase unsuitable for traditional lending  projects moving forward from the identification  exploration and exploratory drilling often trade equity for financing  45   the earth s internal thermal energy flows to the surface by conduction at a rate of 44.2 terawatts (tw   46  and is replenished by radioactive decay of minerals at a rate of 30\xa0tw  47  these power rates are more than double humanity u2019s current energy consumption from all primary sources  but most of this energy flow is not recoverable  in addition to the internal heat flows  the top layer of the surface to a depth of 10 meters (33\xa0ft  is heated by solar energy during the summer  and releases that energy and cools during the winter   outside of the seasonal variations  the geothermal gradient of temperatures through the crust is 25\u201330\xa0\xb0c (77\u201386\xa0\xb0f  per kilometer of depth in most of the world  the conductive heat flux averages 0.1\xa0mw km2  these values are much higher near tectonic plate boundaries where the crust is thinner  they may be further augmented by fluid circulation  either through magma conduits  hot springs  hydrothermal circulation or a combination of these   a geothermal heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground anywhere in the world to provide home heating  but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources  13  the thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature  the most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux  ideally from using a hot spring  the next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer  if no adequate aquifer is available  an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock  this last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in europe  or enhanced geothermal systems in north america  much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers  32   estimates of the potential for electricity generation from geothermal energy vary sixfold  from .035to2tw depending on the scale of investments  7  upper estimates of geothermal resources assume enhanced geothermal wells as deep as 10 kilometres (6\xa0mi   whereas existing geothermal wells are rarely more than 3 kilometres (2\xa0mi  deep  7  wells of this depth are now common in the petroleum industry  the deepest research well in the world  the kola superdeep borehole  is 12 kilometres (7\xa0mi  deep  48    nmyanmar engineering society has identified at least 39 locations  in myanmar  capable of geothermal power production and some of these hydrothermal reservoirs lie quite close to yangon which is a significant underutilized resource  49   according to the geothermal energy association  gea  installed geothermal capacity in the united states grew by 5   or 147.05 mw  ce the last annual survey in march 2012  this increase came from seven geothermal projects that began production in 2012  gea also revised its 2011 estimate of installed capacity upward by 128 mw  bringing current installed u s  geothermal capacity to 3,386 mw  50   geothermal power is considered to be renewable because any projected heat extraction is small compared to the earth s heat content  the earth has an internal heat content of 1031\xa0joules (3\xb71015\xa0tw xb7hr   approximately 100 billion times current (2010  worldwide annual energy consumption  7  about 20  of this is residual heat from planetary accretion  and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay rates that existed in the past  3  natural heat flows are not in equilibrium  and the planet is slowly cooling down on geologic timescales  human extraction taps a minute fraction of the natural outflow  often without accelerating it  clarification needed   geothermal power is also considered to be sustainable thanks to its power to sustain the earth u2019s intricate ecosystems  by using geothermal sources of energy present generations of humans will not endanger the capability of future generations to use their own resources to the same amount that those energy sources are presently used  51  further  due to its low emissions geothermal energy is considered to have excellent potential for mitigation of global warming   even though geothermal power is globally sustainable  extraction must still be monitored to avoid local depletion  47  over the course of decades  individual wells draw down local temperatures and water levels until a new equilibrium is reached with natural flows  the three oldest sites  at larderello  wairakei  and the geysers have experienced reduced output because of local depletion  heat and water  in uncertain proportions  were extracted faster than they were replenished  if production is reduced and water is reinjected  these wells could theoretically recover their full potential  such mitigation strategies have already been implemented at some sites  the long-term sustainability of geothermal energy has been demonstrated at the lardarello field in italy since 1913  at the wairakei field in new zealand since 1958,[52  and at the geysers field in california since 1960.[53   falling electricity production may be boosted through drilling additional supply boreholes  as at poihipi and ohaaki  the wairakei power station has been running much longer  with its first unit commissioned in november 1958  and it attained its peak generation of 173mw in 1965  but already the supply of high-pressure steam was faltering  in 1982 being derated to intermediate pressure and the station managing 157mw  around the start of the 21st century it was managing about 150mw  then in 2005 two 8mw isopentane systems were added  boosting the station s output by about 14mw  detailed data are unavailable  being lost due to re-organisations  one such re-organisation in 1996 causes the absence of early data for poihipi  started 1996   and the gap in 1996/7 for wairakei and ohaaki  half-hourly data for ohaaki s first few months of operation are also missing  as well as for most of wairakei s history   fluids drawn from the deep earth carry a mixture of gases  notably carbon dioxide (co n2   hydrogen sulfide (h n2s   methane (ch n4  and ammonia (nh n3   these pollutants contribute to global warming  acid rain  and noxious smells if released  existing geothermal electric plants emit an average of 122 kilograms (269\xa0lb  of co n2 per megawatt-hour (mw xb7h  of electricity  a small fraction of the emission intensity of conventional fossil fuel plants  54  plants that experience high levels of acids and volatile chemicals are usually equipped with emission-control systems to reduce the exhaust   in addition to dissolved gases  hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic elements such as mercury  arsenic  boron  and antimony  55  these chemicals precipitate as the water cools  and can cause environmental damage if released  the modern practice of injecting cooled geothermal fluids back into the earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental risk   direct geothermal heating systems contain pumps and compressors  which may consume energy from a polluting source  this parasitic load is normally a fraction of the heat output  so it is always less polluting than electric heating  however  if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels  then the net emissions of geothermal heating may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat  for example  a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size  37  therefore  the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid   plant construction can adversely affect land stability  subsidence has occurred in the wairakei field in new zealand  13  in staufen im breisgau  germany  tectonic uplift occurred instead  due to a previously isolated anhydrite layer coming in contact with water and turning into gypsum  doubling its volume  56][57][58  enhanced geothermal systems can trigger earthquakes as part of hydraulic fracturing  the project in basel  switzerland was suspended because more than 10,000 seismic events measuring up to 3.4 on the richter scale occurred over the first 6 days of water injection  59   geothermal has minimal land and freshwater requirements  geothermal plants use 3.5 square kilometres (1.4\xa0sq xa0mi  per xa0gigawatt of electrical production  not capacity  versus 32 square kilometres (12\xa0sq xa0mi  and 12 square kilometres (4.6\xa0sq xa0mi  for coal facilities and wind farms respectively  13  they use 20 litres (5.3\xa0us xa0gal  of freshwater per mw xb7h versus over 1,000 litres (260\xa0us xa0gal  per xa0mw xb7h for nuclear  coal  or oil  13   some of the legal issues raised by geothermal energy resources include questions of ownership and allocation of the resource  the grant of exploration permits  exploitation rights  royalties  and the extent to which geothermal energy issues have been recognized in existing planning and environmental laws  other questions concern overlap between geothermal and mineral or petroleum tenements  broader issues concern the extent to which the legal framework for encouragement of renewable energy assists in encouraging geothermal industry innovation and development
