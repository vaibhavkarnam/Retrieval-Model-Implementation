Energydevelopment
   world total primary energy production  j    note the different y-axis for total  left  and regional curves  right   us energy use flow in 2011    energy development 4][5][6  is a field of endeavor focused on making available sufficient primary energy sources 7  and secondary energy forms to meet the needs of society  8][9][10][11][12  these endeavors encompass those which provide for the production of conventional  alternative and renewable sources of energy  and for the recovery and reuse of energy that would otherwise be wasted  energy conservation note 2  and efficiency measures note 3  reduce the effect of energy development  and can have benefits to society with changes in economic cost and with changes in the environmental effects   contemporary industrial societies use primary and secondary energy sources for transportation and the production of many manufactured goods  also  large industrial populations have various generation and delivery services for energy distribution and end-user utilization  note 4  this energy is used by people who can afford the cost to live under various climatic conditions through the use of heating  ventilation  and or air conditioning  level of use of external energy sources differs across societies  along with the convenience  levels of traffic congestion  pollution sources 13  and availability of domestic energy sources   thousands of people in society are employed in the energy industry  the conventional industry comprises the petroleum industry note 5  the gas industry  note 6  the electrical power industry note 7  the coal industry  and the nuclear power industry  new energy industries include the renewable energy industry  comprising alternative and sustainable manufacture  distribution  and sale of alternative fuels  while there is the development of new hydrocarbon sources  14       colloquially  and in non-scientific literature  the terms power  note 8  fuels  and energy can be used as synonyms  but in the field of energy technology they possess different distinct meanings that are associated with them  an energy source is usually in the form of a closed system  the element that provides the energy by conversion from another energy form  however  the energy can be quantitative  the balance sheet is capable of containing open system energy transfers  note 9  illustrative of this can be the emanations from the sun  which with its nuclear fusion is the most important energy source for the earth note 10  and which provides its energy in the form of radiation   the natural elements note 11  of the material world exist in forms that can be converted into usable energy and are resources from which society can obtain energy to produce heat  light  and motion  among the many uses   according to their nature  the power plants can be classified into   classified according to the energy reserves of the energy source used and the regeneration capacity with   so  for example  shale gas is secondary non-renewable  wind is a primary renewable   the principle stated by antoine lavoisier on the conservation of matter applies to energy development  note 17   nothing is created   thus any energy  production  is actually a recovery transformation of the forms of energy whose origin is that of the universe   for example  a bicycle dynamo turns in part from the kinetic energy  speed energy  of the movement of the cyclist and converting it into electrical energy will transfer in particular to its lights producing light  that is to say light energy  via the heating of the filament of the bulb and therefore heat  thermal energy   but the kinetic energy of the rider is itself biochemical energy  the atp muscle cells  derived from the chemical energy of sugars synthesized by plants who use light energy from the sun  which runs from the nuclear energy produced by fusion of atoms of hydrogen  this material itself constitutes a form of energy  called  mass energy    fossil fuel  primary non-renewable fossil  sources burn coal or hydrocarbon fuels  which are the remains of the decomposition of plants and animals  there are three main types of fossil fuels  coal  petroleum  and natural gas  another fossil fuel  liquefied petroleum gas  lpg   is principally derived from the production of natural gas  heat from burning fossil fuel is used either directly for space heating and process heating  or converted to mechanical energy for vehicles  industrial processes  or electrical power generation   fossil energy is from recovered fossils  like brown coal  hard coal  peat  natural gas and crude oil  and are originated in degradated products of dead plants and animals  these fossil fuels are based on the carbon cycle and thus allow stored  historic solar  energy to be recycled today  in 2005  81  were of the world s energy needs met from fossil sources  15  biomass is also derived from wood and other organic wastes and modern remains  the technical development of fossil fuels in the 18th and 19th century set the stage for the industrial revolution   fossil fuels make up the bulk of the world s current primary energy sources  the technology and infrastructure already exist for the use of fossil fuels  petroleum energy density in terms of volume  cubic space  and mass  weight  ranks currently above that of alternative energy sources  or energy storage devices  like a battery   fossil fuels are currently economical  and suitable for decentralised energy use   dependence on fossil fuels from regions or countries creates energy security risks for dependent countries  16][17][18][19][20  oil dependence in particular has led to war  21  funding of radicals  22  monopolization  23  and socio-political instability  24  fossil fuels are non-renewable  un-sustainable resources  which will eventually decline in production 25  and become exhausted  with consequences to societies that remain dependent on them  fossil fuels are actually slowly forming continuously  but are being consumed quicker than are formed  note 18  extracting fuels becomes increasingly extreme as society consumes the most accessible fuel deposits  extraction in fuel mines get intensive and oil rigs drill deeper  going further out to sea   26  extraction of fossil fuels results in environmental degradation  such as the strip mining and mountaintop removal of coal   fuel efficiency is a form of thermal efficiency  meaning the efficiency of a process that converts chemical potential energy contained in a carrier fuel into kinetic energy or work  the fuel economy is the energy efficiency of a particular vehicle  is given as a ratio of distance travelled per unit of fuel consumed  weight-specific efficiency  efficiency per unit weight  may be stated for freight  and passenger-specific efficiency  vehicle efficiency per passenger   the inefficient atmospheric combustion  burning  of fossil fuels in vehicles  buildings  and power plants contributes to urban heat islands  27   conventional production of oil has peaked  conservatively  between 2007 and 2010  note 19  in 2010  it was estimated that an investment in non-renewable resources of $8 trillion would be required to maintain current levels of production for 25 years  28  in 2010  governments subsidized fossil fuels by an estimated $500 billion a year  29  fossil fuels are also a source of greenhouse gas emissions  leading to concerns about global warming if consumption is not reduced   the combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of pollution into the atmosphere  the fossil fuels are mainly based on organic carbon compounds  they are according to the ipcc the causes of the global warming  30  during the combustion with oxygen in the form of heat energy  carbon dioxide released  depending on the composition and purity of the fossil fuel also results in other chemical compounds such as nitrogen oxides  nox  and soot and other fine particulates alternativey  greenhouse gas emissions result from fossil fuel-based electricity generation  a typical coal plant generates billions of kilowatt hours per year  31  note 20  emissions from such fossil fuel power station include carbon dioxide  sulfur dioxide  small particulates  nitrogen oxides  smog with high levels of ozone  carbon monoxide  co   hydrocarbons  volatile organic compounds  voc   mercury  arsenic  lead  cadmium  other heavy metals  and traces of uranium  32][33   nuclear power  or nuclear energy  is the use of exothermic nuclear processes  34  to generate useful heat and electricity  the term includes nuclear fission  nuclear decay and nuclear fusion  presently the nuclear fission of elements in the actinide series of the periodic table produce the vast majority of nuclear energy in the direct service of humankind  with nuclear decay processes  primarily in the form of geothermal energy  and radioisotope thermoelectric generators  in niche uses making up the rest  nuclear  fission  power stations  excluding the contribution from naval nuclear fission reactors  provided about 5.7  of the world s energy and 13  of the world s electricity in 2012.[35  in 2013  the iaea report that there are 437\xa0operational nuclear power reactors  36  in 31\xa0countries  37  although not every reactor is producing electricity  38  in addition  there are approximately 140 naval vessels using nuclear propulsion in operation  powered by some 180 reactors  39][40][41  as of 2013  attaining a net energy gain from sustained nuclear fusion reactions  excluding natural fusion power sources such as the sun  remains an ongoing area of international physics and engineering research  more than 60 years after the first attempts  commercial fusion power production remains unlikely before 2050.[42   there is an ongoing debate about nuclear power  43][44][45  proponents  such as the world nuclear association  the iaea and environmentalists for nuclear energy contend that nuclear power is a safe  sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions  46  opponents  such as greenpeace international and nirs  contend that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment  47][48][49   nuclear power plant accidents include the chernobyl disaster (1986   fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster (2011   and the three mile island accident (1979).[50  there have also been some nuclear submarine accidents  50][51][52  in terms of lives lost per unit of energy generated  analysis has determined that nuclear power has caused less fatalities per unit of energy generated than the other major sources of energy generation  energy production from coal  petroleum  natural gas and hydropower has caused a greater number of fatalities per unit of energy generated due to air pollution and energy accident effects  53][54][55][56][57  however  the economic costs of nuclear power accidents is high  and meltdowns can take decades to clean up  the human costs of evacuations of affected populations and lost livelihoods is also significant  58][59   in 2016  strengthening the case of nuclear fission being regarded as a renewable energy  the global effort focused on techniques to economically extract the naturally replenishing uranium found in seawater took a step forward and will prevent  peak uranium   as the quantity of uranium now becoming economically recoverable with the field tested absorbent polymer ropes  is practically inexhaustible  60][61   along with other sustainable energy sources  nuclear power is a low carbon power generation method of producing electricity  with an analysis of the literature on its total life cycle emission intensity finding that it is similar to other renewable sources in a comparison of greenhouse gas ghg  emissions per unit of energy generated  62  with this translating into  from the beginning of nuclear power station commercialization in the 1970s  having prevented the emission of approximately 64 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent gtco2-eq  greenhouse gases  gases that would have otherwise resulted from the burning of oil  coal or natural gas in fossil-fuel power stations  63   as of 2012  according to the iaea  worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries  36  approximately 28 of which in the peoples republic of china  prc   with the most recent nuclear power reactor  as of may 2013  to be connected to the electrical grid  occurring on february 17  2013 in hongyanhe nuclear power plant in the prc  64  in the united states  two new generation iii reactors are under construction at vogtle  u s  nuclear industry officials expect five new reactors to enter service by 2020  all at existing plants  65  in 2013  four aging  uncompetitive  reactors were permanently closed  66][67   japan s 2011 fukushima daiichi nuclear accident  which occurred in a reactor design from the 1960s  prompted a rethink of nuclear safety and nuclear energy policy in many countries  68  germany decided to close all its reactors by 2022  and italy has banned nuclear power  68  following fukushima  in 2011 the international energy agency halved its estimate of additional nuclear generating capacity to be built by 2035.[69][70   the economics of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject  since there are diverging views on this topic  and multibillion-dollar investments ride on the choice of an energy source  nuclear power plants typically have high capital costs for building the plant  but low direct fuel costs   in recent years there has been a slowdown of electricity demand growth and financing has become more difficult  which affects large projects such as nuclear reactors  with very large upfront costs and long project cycles which carry a large variety of risks  73  in eastern europe  a number of long-established projects are struggling to find finance  notably belene in bulgaria and the additional reactors at cernavoda in romania  and some potential backers have pulled out  73  where cheap gas is available and its future supply relatively secure  this also poses a major problem for nuclear projects  73   analysis of the economics of nuclear power must take into account who bears the risks of future uncertainties  to date all operating nuclear power plants were developed by state-owned or regulated utility monopolies 75][76  where many of the risks associated with construction costs  operating performance  fuel price  and other factors were borne by consumers rather than suppliers  many countries have now liberalized the electricity market where these risks  and the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered  are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers  which leads to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power plants  77   two of the four eprs under construction  in finland and france  are significantly behind schedule and substantially over cost  78  following the 2011 fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster  costs are likely to go up for currently operating and new nuclear power plants  due to increased requirements for on-site spent fuel management and elevated design basis threats  79  while first of their kind designs  such as the eprs under construction are behind schedule and over-budget  of the seven south korean apr-1400s presently under construction worldwide  two are in s korea at the hanul nuclear power plant and four are at the largest nuclear station construction project in the world as of 2016  in the united arab emirates at the planned barakah nuclear power plant  the first reactor  barakah-1 is 85  completed and on schedule for grid-connection during 2017.[80][81   renewable energy is generally defined as energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale such as sunlight  wind  rain  tides  waves and geothermal heat  82  renewable energy replaces conventional fuels in four distinct areas  electricity generation  hot water space heating  motor fuels  and rural  off-grid  energy services  83   about 16  of global final energy consumption presently comes from renewable resources  with 10  [84  of all energy from traditional biomass  mainly used for heating  and 3.4  from hydroelectricity  new renewables  small hydro  modern biomass  wind  solar  geothermal  and biofuels  account for another 3  and are growing rapidly  85  at the national level  at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20  of energy supply  national renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond  86  wind power  for example  is growing at the rate of 30  annually  with a worldwide installed capacity of 282,482 megawatts  mw  at the end of 2012   renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas  in contrast to other energy sources  which are concentrated in a limited number of countries  rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security  climate change mitigation  and economic benefits  87  in international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power  88   while many renewable energy projects are large-scale  renewable technologies are also suited to rural and remote areas and developing countries  where energy is often crucial in human development  89  united nations  secretary-general ban ki-moon has said that renewable energy has the ability to lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity  90   hydroelectricity is the term referring to electricity generated by hydropower  the production of electrical power through the use of the gravitational force of falling or flowing water  in 2015 hydropower generated 16.6  of the worlds total electricity and 70  of all renewable electricity 91  and is expected to increase about 3.1  each year for the next 25 years   hydropower is produced in 150 countries  with the asia-pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010  china is the largest hydroelectricity producer  with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010  representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use  there are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 gw  the three gorges dam in china  itaipu dam across the brazil paraguay border  and guri dam in venezuela  92   the cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low  making it a competitive source of renewable electricity  the average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 u s  cents per kilowatt-hour  92  hydro is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands  however  damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems  and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife  92  once a hydroelectric complex is constructed  the project produces no direct waste  and has a considerably lower output level of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (co2  than fossil fuel powered energy plants  93   wind  primary renewable natural  power harnesses the power of the wind to propel the blades of wind turbines  these turbines cause the rotation of magnets  which creates electricity  wind towers are usually built together on wind farms  there are offshore and onshore wind farms  global wind power capacity has expanded rapidly to 336 gw in june 2014  and wind energy production was around 4  of total worldwide electricity usage  and growing rapidly  94   wind power is widely used in europe  asia  and the united states  95  several countries have achieved relatively high levels of wind power penetration  such as 21  of stationary electricity production in denmark  96  18  in portugal  96  16  in spain  96  14  in ireland  97  and 9  in germany in 2010.[96][98  by 2011  at times over 50  of electricity in germany and spain came from wind and solar power  99][100  as of 2011  83 countries around the world are using wind power on a commercial basis  98   many of the world s largest onshore wind farms are located in the united states  china  and india  most of the world s largest offshore wind farms are located in denmark  germany and the united kingdom  the two largest offshore wind farm are currently the 630 mw london array and gwynt y m xf4r   solar energy  radiant light and heat from the sun  is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating  solar photovoltaics  solar thermal electricity  solar architecture and artificial photosynthesis  108][109   solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture  convert and distribute solar energy  active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic panels and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy  passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the sun  selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties  and designing spaces that naturally circulate air   in 2011  the international energy agency said that  the development of affordable  inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits  it will increase countries u2019 energy security through reliance on an indigenous  inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource  enhance sustainability  reduce pollution  lower the costs of mitigating climate change  and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise  these advantages are global  hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments  they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared   108   photovoltaics  pv  is a method of generating electrical power by converting solar radiation into direct current electricity using semiconductors that exhibit the photovoltaic effect  photovoltaic power generation employs solar panels composed of a number of solar cells containing a photovoltaic material  materials presently used for photovoltaics include monocrystalline silicon  polycrystalline silicon  amorphous silicon  cadmium telluride  and copper indium gallium selenide sulfide  due to the increased demand for renewable energy sources  the manufacturing of solar cells and photovoltaic arrays has advanced considerably in recent years   solar photovoltaics is a sustainable energy source  110  by the end of 2011  a total of 71.1 gw 111  had been installed  sufficient to generate 85 twh year  112  and by end of 2012  the 100 gw installed capacity milestone was achieved  113  solar photovoltaics is now  after hydro and wind power  the third most important renewable energy source in terms of globally installed capacity  more than 100 countries use solar pv  installations may be ground-mounted  and sometimes integrated with farming and grazing  or built into the roof or walls of a building  either building-integrated photovoltaics or simply rooftop    driven by advances in technology and increases in manufacturing scale and sophistication  the cost of photovoltaics has declined steadily since the first solar cells were manufactured  114  and the levelised cost of electricity  lcoe  from pv is competitive with conventional electricity sources in an expanding list of geographic regions  net metering and financial incentives  such as preferential feed-in tariffs for solar-generated electricity  have supported solar pv installations in many countries  115  the energy payback time  epbt   also known as energy amortization  depends on the location s annual solar insolation and temperature profile  as well as on the used type of pv-technology  for conventional crystalline silicon photovoltaics  the epbt is higher than for thin-film technologies such as cdte-pv or cpv-systems  moreover  the payback time decreased in the recent years due to a number of improvements such as solar cell efficiency and more economic manufacturing processes  as of 2014  photovoltaics recoup on average the energy needed to manufacture them in 0.7 to 2 years  this results in about 95  of net-clean energy produced by a solar rooftop pv system over a 30-year life-time  116]:30  a biofuel is a fuel that contains energy from geologically recent carbon fixation  these fuels are produced from living organisms  examples of this carbon fixation occur in plants and microalgae  these fuels are made by a biomass conversion  biomass refers to recently living organisms  most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials   this biomass can be converted to convenient energy containing substances in three different ways  thermal conversion  chemical conversion  and biochemical conversion  this biomass conversion can result in fuel in solid  liquid  or gas form  this new biomass can be used for biofuels  biofuels have increased in popularity because of rising oil prices and the need for energy security   bioethanol is an alcohol made by fermentation  mostly from carbohydrates produced in sugar or starch crops such as corn or sugarcane  cellulosic biomass  derived from non-food sources  such as trees and grasses  is also being developed as a feedstock for ethanol production  ethanol can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form  but it is usually used as a gasoline additive to increase octane and improve vehicle emissions  bioethanol is widely used in the usa and in brazil  current plant design does not provide for converting the lignin portion of plant raw materials to fuel components by fermentation   biodiesel is made from vegetable oils and animal fats  biodiesel can be used as a fuel for vehicles in its pure form  but it is usually used as a diesel additive to reduce levels of particulates  carbon monoxide  and hydrocarbons from diesel-powered vehicles  biodiesel is produced from oils or fats using transesterification and is the most common biofuel in europe  however  research is underway on producing renewable fuels from decarboxylation 117   in 2010  worldwide biofuel production reached 105 billion liters (28 billion gallons us   up 17  from 2009,[118  and biofuels provided 2.7  of the world s fuels for road transport  a contribution largely made up of ethanol and biodiesel  citation needed  global ethanol fuel production reached 86 billion liters (23 billion gallons us  in 2010  with the united states and brazil as the world s top producers  accounting together for 90  of global production  the world s largest biodiesel producer is the european union  accounting for 53  of all biodiesel production in 2010.[118  as of 2011  mandates for blending biofuels exist in 31 countries at the national level and in 29 states or provinces  98  the international energy agency has a goal for biofuels to meet more than a quarter of world demand for transportation fuels by 2050 to reduce dependence on petroleum and coal  119   geothermal energy is thermal energy generated and stored in the earth  thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter  the geothermal energy of the earth s crust originates from the original formation of the planet (20   and from radioactive decay of minerals (80%).[120  the geothermal gradient  which is the difference in temperature between the core of the planet and its surface  drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface  the adjective geothermal originates from the greek roots \u03b3\u03b7  ge   meaning earth  and \u03b8\u03b5\u03c1\u03bc u03bf u03c2  thermos   meaning hot   earth s internal heat is thermal energy generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from earth s formation  temperatures at the core-mantle boundary may reach over 4000\xa0\xb0c (7,200\xa0\xb0f   121  the high temperature and pressure in earth s interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically  resulting in portions of mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock  rock and water is heated in the crust  sometimes up to 370\xa0\xb0c (700\xa0\xb0f   122   from hot springs  geothermal energy has been used for bathing since paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient roman times  but it is now better known for electricity generation  worldwide  11,400 megawatts  mw  of geothermal power is online in 24 countries in 2012.[123  an additional 28 gigawatts of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district heating  space heating  spas  industrial processes  desalination and agricultural applications in 2010.[124   geothermal power is cost effective  reliable  sustainable  and environmentally friendly  125  but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries  recent technological advances have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources  especially for applications such as home heating  opening a potential for widespread exploitation  geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth  but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels  as a result  geothermal power has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed in place of fossil fuels   the earth s geothermal resources are theoretically more than adequate to supply humanity s energy needs  but only a very small fraction may be profitably exploited  drilling and exploration for deep resources is very expensive  forecasts for the future of geothermal power depend on assumptions about technology  energy prices  subsidies  and interest rates  pilot programs like eweb s customer opt in green power program [126  show that customers would be willing to pay a little more for a renewable energy source like geothermal  but as a result of government assisted research and industry experience  the cost of generating geothermal power has decreased by 25  over the past two decades  127  in 2001  geothermal energy cost between two and ten us cents per kwh  128   marine energy or marine power  also sometimes referred to as ocean energy  ocean power  or marine and hydrokinetic energy  refers to the energy carried by ocean waves  tides  salinity  and ocean temperature differences  the movement of water in the world s oceans creates a vast store of kinetic energy  or energy in motion  this energy can be harnessed to generate electricity to power homes  transport and industries   the term marine energy encompasses both wave power i e  power from surface waves  and tidal power i e  obtained from the kinetic energy of large bodies of moving water  offshore wind power is not a form of marine energy  as wind power is derived from the wind  even if the wind turbines are placed over water  the oceans have a tremendous amount of energy and are close to many if not most concentrated populations  ocean energy has the potential of providing a substantial amount of new renewable energy around the world   the incentive to use 100  renewable energy  for electricity  transport  or even total primary energy supply globally  has been motivated by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns  renewable energy use has grown much faster than anyone anticipated  129  the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand  130  at the national level  at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20  of energy supply  also  professors s  pacala and robert h  socolow have developed a series of  stabilization wedges  that can allow us to maintain our quality of life while avoiding catastrophic climate change  and  renewable energy sources   in aggregate  constitute the largest number of their  wedges   [131   mark z  jacobson says producing all new energy with wind power  solar power  and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050  barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be  primarily social and political  not technological or economic   jacobson says that energy costs with a wind  solar  water system should be similar to today s energy costs  132   similarly  in the united states  the independent national research council has noted that  sufficient domestic renewable resources exist to allow renewable electricity to play a significant role in future electricity generation and thus help confront issues related to climate change  energy security  and the escalation of energy costs \u2026 renewable energy is an attractive option because renewable resources available in the united states  taken collectively  can supply significantly greater amounts of electricity than the total current or projected domestic demand   .[133   critics of the "100  renewable energy  approach include vaclav smil and james e  hansen  smil and hansen are concerned about the variable output of solar and wind power  but amory lovins argues that the electricity grid can cope  just as it routinely backs up nonworking coal-fired and nuclear plants with working ones  134   google spent $30 million on their re lt c project to develop renewable energy and stave off catastrophic climate change  the project was cancelled after concluding that a best-case scenario for rapid advances in renewable energy could only result in emissions 55 percent below the fossil fuel projections for 2050.[135   although increasing the efficiency of energy use is not energy development per se  it may be considered under the topic of energy development since it makes existing energy sources available to do work  137]:22  efficient energy use  simply called energy efficiency  is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services  for example  insulating a home allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature  installing fluorescent lamps or natural skylights reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional incandescent light bulbs  compact fluorescent lights use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights  improvements in energy efficiency are most often achieved by adopting an efficient technology or production process  138   there are various motivations to improve energy efficiency  reducing energy use reduces energy costs and may result in a financial cost saving to consumers if the energy savings offset any additional costs of implementing an energy efficient technology  reducing energy use is also seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing emissions  according to the international energy agency  improved energy efficiency in buildings  industrial processes and transportation could reduce the world s energy needs in 2050 by one third  and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases  139   energy efficiency and renewable energy are said to be the twin pillars of sustainable energy policy  140  in many countries energy efficiency is also seen to have a national security benefit because it can be used to reduce the level of energy imports from foreign countries and may slow down the rate at which domestic energy resources are depleted   while new sources of energy are only rarely discovered or made possible by new technology  distribution technology continually evolves  141  the use of fuel cells in cars  for example  is an anticipated delivery technology  142  this section presents the various delivery technologies that have been important to historic energy development  they all rely in way on the energy sources listed in the previous section   shipping is a flexible delivery technology that is used in the whole range of energy development regimes from primitive to highly advanced  currently  coal  petroleum and their derivatives are delivered by shipping via boat  rail  or road  petroleum and natural gas may also be delivered via pipeline and coal via a slurry pipeline  refined hydrocarbon fuels such as gasoline and lpg may also be delivered via aircraft  natural gas pipelines must maintain a certain minimum pressure to function correctly  ethanol s corrosive properties make it harder to build ethanol pipelines  the higher costs of ethanol transportation and storage are often prohibitive  143  geomagnetically induced currents  seen as interfering with the normal operation of long buried pipeline systems  are a manifestation 144][145  at ground level of space weather that occur due to time-varying ionospheric source fields and the conductivity of the earth   electricity grids are the networks used to transmit and distribute power from production source to end user  when the two may be hundreds of kilometres away  sources include electrical generation plants such as a nuclear reactor  coal burning power plant  etc  a combination of sub-stations  transformers  towers  cables  and piping are used to maintain a constant flow of electricity  grids may suffer from transient blackouts and brownouts  often due to weather damage  during certain extreme space weather events solar wind can interfere with transmissions  grids also have a predefined carrying capacity or load that cannot safely be exceeded  when power requirements exceed what s available  failures are inevitable  to prevent problems  power is then rationed   industrialised countries such as canada  the us  and australia are among the highest per capita consumers of electricity in the world  which is possible thanks to a widespread electrical distribution network  the us grid is one of the most advanced  although infrastructure maintenance is becoming a problem  currentenergy provides a realtime overview of the electricity supply and demand for california  texas  and the northeast of the us  african countries with small scale electrical grids have a correspondingly low annual per capita usage of electricity  one of the most powerful power grids in the world supplies power to the state of queensland  australia   wireless energy transfer is a process whereby electrical energy is transmitted from a power source to an electrical load that does not have a built-in power source  without the use of interconnecting wires   energy storage is accomplished by devices or physical media that store energy to perform useful operation at a later time  a device that stores energy is sometimes called an accumulator   all forms of energy are either potential energy  e g  chemical  gravitational  electrical energy  temperature differential  latent heat  etc   or kinetic energy  e g  momentum   some technologies provide only short-term energy storage  and others can be very long-term such as power to gas using hydrogen or methane and the storage of heat or cold between opposing seasons in deep aquifers or bedrock  a wind-up clock stores potential energy  in this case mechanical  in the spring tension   a battery stores readily convertible chemical energy to operate a mobile phone  and a hydroelectric dam stores energy in a reservoir as gravitational potential energy  ice storage tanks store ice  thermal energy in the form of latent heat  at night to meet peak demand for cooling  fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline store ancient energy derived from sunlight by organisms that later died  became buried and over time were then converted into these fuels  even food  which is made by the same process as fossil fuels  is a form of energy stored in chemical form   since prehistory  when humanity discovered fire to warm up and roast food  through the middle ages in which populations built windmills to grind the wheat  until the modern era in which nations can get electricity splitting the atom  man has sought endlessly for energy sources note 21  from which to draw profit  which have been the fossil fuels  on one hand the coal to fuel the steam engines run industrial rails as well as maintain households  and secondly  the oil and its derivatives in the industry and transportation  primarily automotive   although have lived with smaller-scale exploitation of wind power  hydro and biomass  this model of development  however  is based on the depletion of fossil resources from periods of millions years without possibility for replacement as would be required to maintain  the search for energy sources that are inexhaustible and utilization by industrialized countries to strengthen their national economies by reducing its dependence on fossil fuels  note 22  has led to the adoption of nuclear energy and those with sufficient water resources  the intensive hydraulic use of their waterways   since the beginning of the industrial revolution  the question of the future of energy supplies has been of interest  in 1865  william stanley jevons published the coal question in which he saw that the reserves of coal were being depleted and that oil was an ineffective replacement  in 1914  u s  bureau of mines stated that the total production was 5.7 billion barrels (910,000,000\xa0m3   in 1956  geophysicist m  king hubbert deduces that u s  oil production will peak between 1965 and 1970  peaked in 1971  and that oil production will peak  within half a century  on the basis of 1956 data  note 23  in 1989  predicted peak by colin campbell 146  in 2004  opec estimated  with substantial investments  it would nearly double oil output by 2025[147   the environmental movement has emphasized sustainability of energy use and development  148  renewable energy is sustainable in its production  the available supply will not be diminished for the foreseeable future - millions or billions of years   sustainability  also refers to the ability of the environment to cope with waste products  especially air pollution  sources which have no direct waste products  such as wind  solar  and hydropower  are brought up on this point  with global demand for energy growing  the need to adopt various energy sources is growing  energy conservation is an alternative or complementary process to energy development  it reduces the demand for energy by using it efficiently   some observers contend that idea of  energy independence  is an unrealistic note 24  and opaque concept  149  the alternative offer of  energy resilience  is a goal aligned with economic  security  and energy realities  the notion of resilience in energy was detailed in the 1982 book brittle power  energy strategy for national security  150  the authors argued that simply switching to domestic energy would not be secure inherently because the true weakness is the interdependent and vulnerable energy infrastructure of the united states  key aspects such as gas lines and the electrical power grid are centralized and easily susceptible to disruption  they conclude that a  resilient energy supply  is necessary for both national security and the environment  they recommend a focus on energy efficiency and renewable energy that is decentralized  151   in 2008  former intel corporation chairman and ceo andrew grove looked to energy resilience  arguing that complete independence is unfeasible given the global market for energy  152  he describes energy resilience as the ability to adjust to interruptions in the supply of energy  to that end  he suggests the u s  make greater use of electricity  153  electricity can be produced from a variety of sources  a diverse energy supply will be less affected by the disruption in supply of any one source  he reasons that another feature of electrification is that electricity is  sticky  \u2013 meaning the electricity produced in the u s  is to stay there because it cannot be transported overseas  according to grove  a key aspect of advancing electrification and energy resilience will be converting the u s  automotive fleet from gasoline-powered to electric-powered  this  in turn  will require the modernization and expansion of the electrical power grid  as organizations such as the reform institute have pointed out  advancements associated with the developing smart grid would facilitate the ability of the grid to absorb vehicles en masse connecting to it to charge their batteries  154   extrapolations from current knowledge to the future offer a choice of energy futures  157  predictions parallel the malthusian catastrophe hypothesis  numerous are complex models based scenarios as pioneered by limits to growth  modeling approaches offer ways to analyze diverse strategies  and hopefully find a road to rapid and sustainable development of humanity  short term energy crises are also a concern of energy development  extrapolations lack plausibility  particularly when they predict a continual increase in oil consumption  citation needed   energy production usually requires an energy investment  drilling for oil or building a wind power plant requires energy  the fossil fuel resources  see above  that are left are often increasingly difficult to extract and convert  they may thus require increasingly higher energy investments  if investment is greater than the energy produced by the resource  it is no longer an effective energy source  158  note 25  this means that resources  the wasteful ones  are not used effectively for energy production  note 26  such resources can be exploited economically in order to produce raw materials  note 27  they then become ordinary mining reserves  economically recoverable are not a positive energy sources  new technology may ameliorate this problem if it can lower the energy investment required to extract and convert the resources  although ultimately basic physics sets limits that cannot be exceeded   between 1950 and 1984  as the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe  world grain production increased by 250   the energy for the green revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers  natural gas   pesticides  oil   and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation  159  the peaking of world hydrocarbon production  peak oil  may lead to significant changes  and require sustainable methods of production  160  one vision of a sustainable energy future involves all human structures on the earth s surface  i e   buildings  vehicles and roads  doing artificial photosynthesis  using sunlight to split water as a source of hydrogen and absorbing carbon dioxide to make fertilizer  efficiently than plants  161   with contemporary space industry s economic activity 162][163  and the related private spaceflight  with the manufacturing industries  that go into earth s orbit or beyond  delivering them to those regions will require further energy development  164][165][166][167  commercialization of space includes satellite navigation systems  satellite television and satellite radio  investments estimated to be $50.8 billion  168  researchers have contemplated space-based solar power for collecting solar power in space for use on earth  note 28  note 29  space-based solar power only differ from solar and other similar radiant energy collection methods in that the means used to collect energy would reside on an orbiting satellite instead of on earth s surface  some projected benefits of such a system are a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing and refracting atmosphere and nighttime in space  note 30
