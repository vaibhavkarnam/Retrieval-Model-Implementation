similarly named currencies such as the gibraltar pound or occasionally the syrian pound  it is also sometimes used for currencies named lira  for example the now withdrawn italian lira  and on rare occasion  the turkish lira   the symbol derives from a capital  l   representing libra  the basic unit of weight in the roman empire  which in turn is derived from the latin name of the same spelling for scales or a balance  the pound became an english unit of weight and was so named because it originally had the value of one tower pound (~350 grams  of fine  pure  silver   the pound sign is placed before the number  e g  "\xa312,000   and separated from the following digits by no space or only a thin space   the symbol \u20a4 was called the lira sign in italy  before the adoption of the euro  it was used  in free variation with \xa3  as an alternative to the more usual l or lit  to show prices in lire  it was also used unofficially as the symbol of the maltese lira instead of the official lm   in american english  the term  pound sign  usually refers to the symbol    see number sign   and the corresponding telephone key is called the  pound key   1  the symbols \xa3 and   are both referred to as the pound sign in canadian english    is also referred to as the  number sign  and  noughts-and-crosses board    2   in the eighteenth-century caslon metal fonts  the pound sign

lira sign  is not widely used  and the preferred sign for lira is the pound sign  contradictory  some fonts render the pound sign with a double bar  for example on a previous version of the british five pound note 5    this is simply a different glyph  and the underlying character  and therefore unicode codepoint  is still a pound sign  and not a lira sign   prior to the introduction of the ibm pc  there was no unique accepted standard for entering  displaying  printing  or storing the \xa3 sign in the uk computer industry  on personal computers prior to the pc the     key was often used  sometimes it was displayed on screen as      but many printers could be set up to print "\xa3  where     was sent to the printer by an application program  keying in  storing  displaying  and printing the sign often required special set-up  although the     sign is commonly called the  hash symbol   it is also referred to as the  pound sign  in north america  though in reference to the unit of weight  not the unit of currency   it is also known as the number symbol or key   the commodore 64 computer included a dedicated key for the pound sign  to the right of the number row    the bbc micro used a variant of ascii that replaced the backtick       character 96  hex 60  with the pound sign  iso iec 8859 had not yet been standardised  and it was advantageous to have commonly used characters available in the lower  7-bit ascii table   denoted as chr 96 or  hex  chr  amp 60  since the bbc micro used a teletext mode as standard  this means that the pound sign is in the 7-bit ascii variant used on teletext systems such as ceefax  oracle and teletext ltd as well   on latin-alphabet typewriters lacking a "\xa3  symbol type element  a reasonable approximation can be made by typing an  f  over an  l    on microsoft windows  linux and unix  the uk keyboard layout has the "\xa3  symbol on the 3 number key and is typed using   on a us-international keyboard in windows  the "\xa3  can be entered using   on a us-international keyboard in linux and unix  the "\xa3  can be entered using   in windows  it can also be generated through the alt keycodes   in ms-dos  the character map utility and microsoft word s insert symbol commands may also be used to enter this character   the symbol "\xa3  is in the macroman character set and can be generated on most non-uk mac os keyboard layouts which do not have a dedicated key for it  typically through   on uk apple mac keyboards  this is reversed  with the "\xa3  symbol on the number 3 key  typed using   the compose key sequence is   in the 1980s  the two main standards for the print codes for a pound sign were ascii 186 for the hp laserjet and ascii 156 for most other printers including the ibm quietwriter and epson dot matrix printers  in order to print a pound sign  each word processor needed to be set up individually to print the sign for a particular printer  for many word processors a terminate and stay resident program  tsr  was needed to convert the code generated by the package into the right code for the printer  packages such as wordperfect had utilities to set up this conversion without needing a tsr
