Energyefficiencyintransportation
 energy efficiency in transportation is  strictly speaking  useful output  kilometers  miles  etc   divided by total energy input  kilowatt-hour  amount of gasoline  etc    this is more precisely known as fuel economy  symbol fe   and commonly measured in units of km l or mi gal (mpg   1][2   energy efficiency in transportation is often  and confusingly  described in terms of fuel consumption  symbol fc   fuel consumption is the reciprocal of fuel economy 2  and is occasionally known as energy intensity  3  it equals fuel  energy  divided by distance  and is often measured in units of liters per 100 kilometers (l 100\xa0km   joules per kilometer  j km   gallon-equivalent per 100 miles (gale 100\xa0mi   or kilowatt-hours per distance  kw-hr km or kw-hr mi    the energy efficiency in transportation varies by mode of transportation  listed below   different types of transportation range from some hundred kilojoules per kilometre  kj km  for a bicycle to tens of megajoules per kilometer  mj km  for a helicopter       both fuel economy and fuel consumption are often given on a per-vehicle basis  more refined units of measurement exist  such as fuel consumption per passenger or fuel consumption per mass of cargo   energy efficiency is expressed in terms of fuel economy  2   energy intensity  reciprocal efficiency  3  is expressed terms of fuel consumption  2   for freight transport  rail and ship transport are generally much more efficient than trucking  and air freight is much less efficient  5][6   a 68\xa0kg (150\xa0lb  person walking at 4\xa0km h (2.5\xa0mph  requires approximately 210 kilocalories (880\xa0kj  of food energy per hour  which is equivalent to 4.55\xa0km mj  7  1\xa0us xa0gal (3.8\xa0l  of gasoline contains about 114,000 british thermal units (120\xa0mj  8  of energy  so this is approximately equivalent to 360 miles per us gallon (0.65\xa0l 100\xa0km    velomobiles have the highest energy efficiency of any known mode of personal transportation  at a speed of 50\xa0km h (31\xa0mph   the velomobile manufacturer waw claims that only 0.5\xa0kw xb7h of food energy per 100\xa0km is needed to transport the passenger  which is around \u200a1\u20445 (20   of what is needed to power a standard upright bicycle  and \u200a1\u204450 (2   of that which is consumed by an average fossil fuel or electric car  this corresponds to 4700 miles per us gallon (2000\xa0km l  0.05\xa0l 100\xa0km   9  other sources give a figure of \u200a1\u20443.4 (29.5   of the energy use of a normal bicycle  10   a lightweight and moderate-speed vehicle with low-friction tires and an efficient chain-driven drivetrain  the bicycle is one of the most energy-efficient forms of transportation  compared with walking  a 64\xa0kg (140\xa0lb  cyclist riding at 16\xa0km h (10\xa0mph  requires about half the food energy per unit distance  43\xa0kcal mi  27\xa0kcal km or 3.1\xa0kw xb7h (11\xa0mj  per 100\xa0km  7  this converts to about 732\xa0mpg u2011us (0.321\xa0l 100\xa0km  879\xa0mpg u2011imp   11  this means that a bicycle will use between 10-25 times less energy per distance traveled than a personal car  depending on fuel source and size of the car  this figure does depend on the speed and mass of the rider  greater speeds give higher air drag and heavier riders consume more energy per unit distance  in addition  because bicycles are very lightweight  usually between 7-15 kg  this means they consume very low amounts of materials and energy to manufacture  especially in comparison to an automobile weighing 1500kg or more  this means that a bicycle typically requires 100-200 times less energy to produce than an automobile  which for an automobile can make up a large portion of its total energy use  as discussed below in the automobile section    a motorized bicycle allows human power and the assistance of a 49\xa0cm3 (3.0\xa0cu xa0in  engine  giving a range of 160\xa0to 200\xa0mpg u2011us (1.5\u20131.2\xa0l 100\xa0km  190\u2013240\xa0mpg u2011imp   citation needed  electric pedal-assisted bikes run on as little as 1.0\xa0kw xb7h (3.6\xa0mj  per 100\xa0km  citation needed  while maintaining speeds in excess of 30\xa0km h (19\xa0mph   citation needed  these best-case figures rely on a human doing 70  of the work  with around 3.6\xa0mj (1.0\xa0kw xb7h  per 100\xa0km coming from the motor  this makes an electric bicycle one of the most efficient possible motorized vehicles  behind only a motorized velomobile   to be thorough  a comparison must also consider the energy costs of producing  transporting and packaging of fuel  food or fossil fuel   the energy incurred in disposing of exhaust waste  and the energy costs of manufacturing the vehicle  this last can be significant given that walking requires little or no special equipment  while automobiles  for example  require a great deal of energy to produce and have relatively short lifespans  in addition  any comparison of electric vehicles and liquid-fuelled vehicles must include the fuel consumed in the power station to generate the electricity  in the uk for instance the efficiency of the electricity generation and distribution system is around 0.40 citation needed    automobile fuel efficiency is most commonly expressed in terms of the volume of fuel consumed per one hundred kilometres (l 100\xa0km   but in some countries  including the usa  uk and india  it is more commonly expressed in terms of the distance per volume fuel consumed  km l or miles per us or imperial gallon   this is complicated by the different energy content of fuels such as petrol and diesel  the oak ridge national laboratory  ornl  states that the energy content of unleaded gasoline is 115,000 british thermal unit  btu  per us gallon (32\xa0mj l  compared to 130,500 btu per us gallon (36.4\xa0mj l  for diesel  12   a second important consideration is the energy costs of producing energy  bio-fuels  electricity and hydrogen  for instance  have significant energy inputs in their production  because of this  the efficiency of 50-70   from natural gas  or 10-15   from electricity  of hydrogen production  as well as the vast amounts of energy required to store and transport hydrogen must to be combined with the vehicle efficiency to yield net efficiency  13 because of this  hydrogen automobiles are one of the least efficient means of passenger transportation  generally around 50 times as much energy must be put into the production of hydrogen compared to how much is used to move the car   a third consideration to take into account is the occupancy rate of the vehicle  as the number of passengers per vehicle increases the consumption per unit distance per vehicle increases  however this increase is slight compared to the reduction in consumption per unit distance per passenger  we can compare  for instance  the estimated average occupancy rate of about 1.3 passengers per car in the san francisco bay area 14  to the 2006 uk estimated average of 1.58.[15   fourth  the energy needed to build and maintain roads is an important consideration  as is the energy returned on energy invested  eroei   between these two factors  roughly 20  must be added to the energy of the fuel consumed  to accurately account for the total energy used  citation needed   finally  vehicle energy efficiency calculations would be misleading without factoring the energy cost of producing the vehicle itself  this initial energy cost can of course be depreciated over the life of the vehicle to calculate an average energy efficiency over its effective life span  in other words  vehicles that take a lot of energy to produce and are used for relatively short periods will require a great deal more energy over their effective lifespan than those that do not  and are therefore much less energy efficient than they may otherwise seem  hybrid and electric cars use less energy in their operation than comparable petroleum-fueled cars but more energy is used to manufacture them  so the overall difference would be less than immediately apparent  compare  for example  walking  which requires no special equipment at all  and an automobile  produced in and shipped from another country  and made from parts manufactured around the world from raw materials and minerals mined and processed elsewhere again  and used for a limited number of years  according to the french energy and environment agency ademe  16  an average motor car has an embodied energy content of 20,800 kwh and an average electric vehicle amounts to 34,700 kwh  the electric car requires nearly twice as much energy to produce  primarily due to the large amount of mining and purification necessary for the rare earth metals and other materials used in lithium-ion batteries and in the electric drive motors  this represents a significant portion of the energy used over the life of the car  in some cases nearly as much as energy that is used through the fuel that is consumed  effectively doubling the car s per-distance energy consumption   and cannot be ignored when comparing automobiles to other transportation modes  it is important to note  also  that as these are average numbers for french automobiles and they are are likely to be significantly larger in more auto-centric countries like the united states and canada  where much larger and heavier cars are more common   driving practices and vehicles can be modified to improve their energy efficiency by about 15%.[17][18   on a percentage basis  if there is one occupant in an automobile  between 0.4-0.6  of the total energy used is used to move the person in the car  while 99.4-99.6   about 165 to 250 times more  is used to move the car   a principal determinant of energy consumption in aircraft is drag  which must be opposed by thrust for the aircraft to progress   passenger airplanes averaged 4.8 l 100\xa0km per passenger (1.4 mj passenger-km  (49 passenger-miles per gallon  in 1998  citation needed  note that on average 20  of seats are left unoccupied  jet aircraft efficiencies are improving  between 1960 and 2000 there was a 55  overall fuel efficiency gain  if one were to exclude the inefficient and limited fleet of the dh comet 4 and to consider the boeing 707 as the base case   33  most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use  compared to advanced piston engine airliners of the 1950s  current jet airliners are only marginally more efficient per passenger-mile  34  between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4   concorde the supersonic transport managed about 17 passenger-miles to the imperial gallon  similar to a business jet  but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft  airbus puts the fuel rate consumption of their a380 at less than 3 l 100\xa0km per passenger (78 passenger-miles per us gallon   35   the mass of an aircraft can be reduced by using light-weight materials such as titanium  carbon fiber and other composite plastics  expensive materials may be used  if the reduction of mass justifies the price of materials through improved fuel efficiency  the improvements achieved in fuel efficiency by mass reduction  reduces the amount of fuel that needs to be carried  this further reduces the mass of the aircraft and therefore enables further gains in fuel efficiency  for example  the airbus a380 design includes multiple light-weight materials   airbus has showcased wingtip devices  sharklets or winglets  that can achieve 3.5 percent reduction in fuel consumption  36][37  there are wingtip devices on the airbus a380  further developed minix winglets have been said to offer 6 percent reduction in fuel consumption  38  winglets at the tip of an aircraft wing smooth out the wing-tip vortex  reducing the aircraft s wing drag  and can be retrofitted to any airplane  38   nasa and boeing are conducting tests on a 500\xa0lb (230\xa0kg   blended wing  aircraft  this design allows for greater fuel efficiency since the whole craft produces lift  not just the wings  39  the blended wing body  bwb  concept offers advantages in structural  aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over today s more conventional fuselage-and-wing designs  these features translate into greater range  fuel economy  reliability and life cycle savings  as well as lower manufacturing costs  40][41  nasa has created a cruise efficient stol  cestol  concept   fraunhofer institute for manufacturing engineering and applied materials research  ifam  have researched a shark skin imitating paint that would reduce drag through a riblet effect  42  aircraft are a major potential application for new technologies such as aluminium metal foam and nanotechnology such as the shark skin imitating paint   propfan propulsors are a more fuel efficient technology than jets or turboprops  but turboprops have an optimum speed below about 450\xa0mph (700\xa0km h   43  this speed is less than used with jets by major airlines today  however  the decrease in speed reduces drag  with the current  needs update  high price for jet fuel and the emphasis on engine airframe efficiency to reduce emissions  there is renewed interest in the propfan concept for jetliners that might come into service beyond the boeing 787 and airbus a350xwb  for instance  airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted counter-rotating propfans  44  nasa has conducted an advanced turboprop project  atp   where they researched a variable pitch propfan that produced less noise and achieved high speeds   related to fuel efficiency is the impact of aviation emissions on climate   cunard stated that queen elizabeth 2 travelled 49.5 feet per imperial gallon of diesel oil (3.32\xa0m l or 41.2\xa0ft us xa0gal   and that it had a passenger capacity of 1777.[48  thus carrying 1777 passengers we can calculate an efficiency of 16.7 passenger miles per imperial gallon (16.9\xa0l 100\xa0p xb7km or 13.9\xa0p xb7mpg u2013us    ms xa0oasis of the seas has a capacity of 6,296 passengers and a fuel efficiency of 14.4 passenger miles per us gallon  voyager-class cruise ships have a capacity of 3,114 passengers and a fuel

rotterdam  50  which is roughly 430 hours  and has 80\xa0mw  +30\xa0mw  18 days at a mean speed of 25 knots (46\xa0km h  gives a total distance of 10,800 nautical miles (20,000\xa0km    a sailboat  much like a solar car  can locomote without consuming any fuel  a sail boat such as a dinghy using just wind power requires no input energy in terms of fuel  however some manual energy is required by the crew to steer the boat and adjust the sails using ropes  in addition energy will be needed for demands other than propulsion  such as cooking  heating or lighting  the fuel efficiency of a single-occupancy boat is highly dependent on the size of its engine  the speed at which it travels  and its displacement  due to the high viscosity of water  with a single passenger  the equivalent energy efficiency will be lower than in a car  train  or plane   trains are in general one of the most efficient means of transport for freight and passengers  efficiency varies significantly with passenger loads  and losses incurred in electricity generation and supply  for electrified systems   51][52  and  importantly  end-to-end delivery  where stations are not the originating final destinations of a journey   actual consumption depends on gradients  maximum speeds  loading and stopping patterns  data produced for the european meet project  methodologies for estimating air pollutant emissions  illustrate the different consumption patterns over several track sections  the results show the consumption for a german ice high-speed train varied from around 19\xa0to 33\xa0kw xb7h km (68\u2013119\xa0mj km  31\u201353\xa0kw xb7h mi   the data also reflects the weight of the train per passenger  for example  tgv double-deck duplex trains use lightweight materials  which keep axle loads down and reduce damage to track and also save energy  53   energy consumption estimates for rail freight vary widely  and many are provided by interested parties  some are tabulated below   considering only the energy spent to move the train  and taking as example the urban area of lisbon  train seems to be on average 20 times more efficient than automobile for transportation of passengers  if we consider energy spent per passenger-km  65  considering an automobile which has a consumptions of around 6\xa0l 100\xa0km (47\xa0mpg u2011imp  39\xa0mpg u2011us  of gasoline  the fact the on average cars in europe have an occupation ratio of around 1.2 passengers per automobile and that one litre of gasoline amounts for about 8826 wh  one gets on average 441\xa0wh (1,590\xa0kj

one gets 21.5 wh per passenger-km  20 times less than the automobile   stopping is a considerable source of inefficiency  modern electric trains like the shinkansen  the bullet train  use regenerative braking to return current into the catenary while they brake  a siemens study indicated that regenerative braking might recover 41.6  of the total energy consumed  the passenger rail  urban and intercity  and scheduled intercity and all charter bus industries technological and operational improvements \u2013 final report states that  commuter operations can dissipate more than half of their total traction energy in braking for stops   and that  we estimate head-end power to be 35 percent  but it could possibly be as high as 45 percent  of total energy consumed by commuter railways   66  having to accelerate and decelerate a heavy train load of people at every stop is inefficient despite regenerative braking which can recover typically around 20  of the energy wasted in braking  weight is a determinant of braking losses   aea study of road and rail for the united kingdom department for transport  final report  rail and bus are generally required to serve  off peak  and rural services  which by their nature have lower loads than city bus routes and inter city train lines  moreover  due to their  walk on  ticketing it is much harder to match daily demand and passenger numbers  as a consequence  the overall load factor on uk railways is 35  or 90 people per train  72   conversely  airline services generally work on point-to-point networks between large population centres and are  pre-book  in nature  using yield management  overall load factors can be raised to around 70\u201390   intercity train operators have begun to use similar techniques  with loads reaching typically 71  overall for tgv services in france and a similar figure for the uk s virgin trains services  73   for emissions  the electricity generating source needs to be taken into account

vehicles  as they represent the real world driving conditions  including extreme weather and traffic  the annual report is called energy efficiency trends analysis  there are dozens of tables illustrating trends in energy consumption expressed in energy per passenger km  passengers  or energy per tonne km (freight   82   the environmental calculator of the french environment and energy agency  ademe  published in 2007 using data from 2005[83  enables one to compare the different means of transportation as regards the co2 emissions  in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent  as well as the consumption of primary energy  in the case of an electric vehicle  the ademe makes the assumption that 2.58\xa0toe as primary energy are necessary for producing one toe of electricity as end energy in france  see embodied energy embodied energy in the energy field    this computer tool devised by the ademe shows the importance of public transportation from an environmental point of view  it highlights the primary energy consumption as well as the co2 emissions due to transportation  due to the relatively low environmental impact of radioactive waste  compared to that of fossil fuel combustion emissions  this is not a factor in the tool  moreover  intermodal passenger transport is probably a key to sustainable transport  by allowing people to use less polluting means of transportation
