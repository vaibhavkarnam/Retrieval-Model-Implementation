 renewable energy in albania ranges from biomass  geothermal  hydropower  solar  wind energy in albania  1  albania relies mostly on hydroelectric resources  therefore  it has difficulties when water levels are low  albania has a great potential for solar  wind  and geothermal energy  the climate in albania is mediterranean so it possesses considerable potential for solar energy  2  similarly  the mountain elevations provide good areas for wind projects  there is also potential for geothermal energy because albania has natural wells       the current electricity source in albania is mostly from hydropower plants  however  this is not very reliable since water levels fluctuate  verbund  an austria company  and albania made an agreement to construct the hydropower plant ashta in 2012  it is estimated to supply power to approximately 100,000 households  3   the united nations development program is supporting a program to install solar panels in albania  the program has used $2.75 million to support the installation of 75,000m2 of solar panels  by 2010  10,700m2 of solar panels were installed and by 2014 the target had been met  there are 50,000m2 of solar panels expected to be installed by 2015.[3  albania gets about 2100\u20132700 hours of sunshine in a year so it has a great potential for solar energy  4  solar energy is easily accessible since most energy comes directly or indirectly from the sun  it could be used for heating and lighting homes  commercial  and industrial buildings  5   albania has potential for wind energy but technologies have not been developed  however  there are plans to develop wind projects in the next years  there is a plan proposing to have 2000mw of wind energy  wind generates mechanical power through wind turbines  some geographic locations are better than others because the wind power depends on the speed of the wind  the coastal lowlands and southern  eastern  and northern albania mountains are good areas for wind turbines  however  there are constraints that take part in choosing location including  altitude  site accessibility  infrastructures  protected areas  and power grid  the wind speed is 8\u20139\xa0m s in many areas of albania  albania might export excess wind energy to italy  3   geothermal energy could also be used in albania  it comes from warm water sources from underground soil  geothermal energy comes from the heat generated by the earth  there are some spots called hot spots that generate more heat than others  there are natural wells near albania u2019s border with greece  this energy could be used for heating purposes  geothermal energy in albania is under study and there have been no attempts to use it yet  2   the power sector law no 9073  approved in 2004  gives permits to construct new hydropower plants  3   the concession law no 9663  approved in 2006  attracts private investments in hydropower plants  3   albania placed a tariff for existing and new hydropower plants in 2007.[3   the electricity market model was approved in 2008  it facilitates purchases between independent power producers and small power producers  it allows producers to sell electricity to all markets at agreed terms  non-household customers can become eligible consumers and choose their energy suppliers  this helps renewable energy to be more accessible  3    media related to renewable energy in albania at wikimedia commons
