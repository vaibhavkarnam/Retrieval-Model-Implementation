Scandinavia
 minority or regional languages   scandinavia a  /\u02ccsk xe6nd u1d7b u02c8ne u026avi u0259  is a historical and cultural region in northern europe characterized by a common ethnocultural north germanic heritage and mutually intelligible north germanic languages  2   the term scandinavia always includes the three kingdoms of denmark  norway  and sweden  the remote norwegian islands of svalbard and jan mayen are usually not seen as a part of scandinavia  nor is greenland  an overseas territory of denmark  however  the faroe islands  also a danish overseas territory  are sometimes included  as sometimes are iceland  finland and the finnish autonomous region of the \xc5land islands  because of their historical association with the scandinavian countries and the scandinavian peoples and languages  3  this looser definition almost equates to that of the nordic countries  in nordic languages  only denmark  norway and sweden are commonly included in the definition of scandinavia  clarification needed   in english usage  scandinavia sometimes refers to the geographical area  also known as the scandinavian peninsula  4][5  the name scandinavia originally referred vaguely to the formerly danish  now swedish  region scania  the terms scandinavia and scandinavian entered usage in the late 18th century as terms for denmark  norway and sweden  their germanic majority peoples and associated language and culture  the term being introduced by the early linguistic and cultural scandinavist movement   the majority of the population of scandinavia are descended from several  north  germanic tribes who originally inhabited the southern part of scandinavia and spoke a germanic language that evolved into old norse  icelanders and the faroese are to a significant extent descended from the norse  and are therefore often seen as scandinavian  finland is mainly populated by finns  with a minority of approximately 5  citation needed  of swedish speakers  a small minority of sami people live in the extreme north of scandinavia   the danish  norwegian  and swedish languages form a dialect continuum and are known as the scandinavian languages u2014all of which are considered mutually intelligible with one another  faroese and icelandic  sometimes referred to as insular scandinavian languages  are intelligible in continental scandinavian languages only to a limited extent  finnish and me xe4nkieli are closely related to each other and more distantly to the sami languages  but are entirely unrelated to the scandinavian languages  apart from these  german  yiddish and romani are recognized minority languages in scandinavia   the southern and by far most populous regions of scandinavia have a temperate climate  scandinavia extends north of the arctic circle  but has relatively mild weather for its latitude due to the gulf stream  much of the scandinavian mountains have an alpine tundra climate  there are many lakes and moraines  legacies of the last glacial period  which ended about ten millennia ago        scandinavia  usually refers to denmark  norway  and sweden  6  some sources argue for the inclusion of the faroe islands  finland and iceland  3][7][8][9][10  though that broader region is usually known by the countries concerned as norden  finnish pohjoismaat  icelandic nor xf0url xf6ndin  faroese nor xf0urlond   or the nordic countries  11   the use of the name  scandinavia  as a convenient general term for the three kingdoms of denmark  norway and sweden is fairly recent  according to some historians  it was adopted and introduced in the eighteenth century  at a time when the ideas about a common heritage started to appear and develop into early literary and linguistic scandinavism  5  before this time  the term scandinavia was familiar mainly to classical scholars through pliny the elder s writings  and was used vaguely for scania and the southern region of the peninsula  5   as a political term   scandinavia  was first used by students agitating for pan-scandinavianism in the 1830s  5  the popular usage of the term in sweden  denmark and norway as a unifying concept became established in the nineteenth century through poems such as hans christian andersen s  i am a scandinavian  of 1839  after a visit to sweden  andersen became a supporter of early political scandinavism  in a letter describing the poem to a friend  he wrote   all at once i understood how related the swedes  the danes and the norwegians are  and with this feeling i wrote the poem immediately after my return   we are one people  we are called scandinavians    12   the clearest example of the use of the term  scandinavia  as a political and societal construct is the unique position of finland  based largely on the fact that most of modern-day finland was part of the swedish kingdom for hundreds of years  thus to much of the world associating finland with all of scandinavia  but the creation of a finnish identity is unique in the region in that it was formed in relation to two different imperial models  the swedish 13  and the russian  14][15  as described by the university of jyv xe4skyl xe4 based editorial board of the finnish journal yearbook of political thought and conceptual history  16   the term is often defined according to the conventions of the cultures that lay claim to the term in their own use  17  when a speaker wants to explicitly include finland alongside scandinavia-proper  the geographic terms fenno-scandinavia or fennoscandia are sometimes used in english  although these terms are hardly if at all used within scandinavia  more precisely  and subject to no dispute  is that finland is included in the broader term  nordic countries    various promotional agencies of the nordic countries in the united states  such as the american-scandinavian foundation  established in 1910 by the danish american industrialist niels poulsen  serve to promote market and tourism interests in the region  today  the five nordic heads of state act as the organization s patrons and according to the official statement by the organization  its mission is  to promote the nordic region as a whole while increasing the visibility of denmark  finland  iceland  norway and sweden in new york city and the united states   18  the official tourist boards of scandinavia sometimes cooperate under one umbrella  such as the scandinavian tourist board  19  the cooperation was introduced for the asian market in 1986  when the swedish national tourist board joined the danish national tourist board to coordinate intergovernmental promotion of the two countries  norway s government entered one year later  all five nordic governments participate in the joint promotional efforts in the united states through the scandinavian tourist board of north america  20   while the term scandinavia is commonly used for denmark  norway and sweden  the term the nordic countries is used unambiguously for denmark  norway  sweden  finland  and iceland  including their associated territories  greenland  the faroe islands  and the \xc5land islands   21  scandinavia can thus be considered a subset of the nordic countries  furthermore  the term fennoscandia refers to scandinavia  finland and karelia  excluding denmark and overseas territories  however  the usage of this term is restricted to geology  when speaking of the fennoscandian shield  baltic shield    in addition to the mainland scandinavian countries of   the nordic countries also consist of   estonia has applied for membership in the nordic council  referring to its cultural heritage and close linguistic links to finland  and historical connections to both denmark and sweden  although normally estonia is regarded as one of the baltic countries  it is similar to the situation of finland around the 1920s as finland was considered to be one of the baltic states as well  citation needed  as it too had emerged from russian domination along with the other three countries under similar circumstances  while finnish and estonian are finnic languages  latvian and lithuanian are baltic languages   it should be noted that whereas the term  scandinavia  is relatively straightforward as traditionally relating to the three kingdoms of denmark  norway and sweden there exists some ambiguity as regards the ethnic aspect of the concept in the modern era  traditionally  the term refers specifically to the majority peoples of denmark  norway and sweden  their states  their germanic languages and their culture  in the modern era  the term will often include minority peoples such as the sami and me xe4nkieli speakers in a political and to some extent cultural sense  as they are citizens of scandinavian countries and speak scandinavian languages either as their first or second language  however  scandinavian is still also seen as an ethnic term for the germanic majority peoples of scandinavia  and as such  the inclusion of sami and finnish speakers can be seen as controversial within these groups   scandinavia and scania (sk xe5ne  the southernmost province of sweden  are considered to have the same etymology  both terms are thought to go back to the proto-germanic compound *ska xf0in-awj u014d  which appears later in old english as scedenig and in old norse as sk xe1ney  22  the earliest identified source for the name scandinavia is pliny the elder s natural history  dated to the first century a d   various references to the region can also be found in pytheas  pomponius mela  tacitus  ptolemy  procopius and jordanes  usually in the form of scandza  it is believed that the name used by pliny may be of west germanic origin  originally denoting scania  23  according to some scholars  the germanic stem can be reconstructed as *ska xf0an- meaning  danger  or  damage   english scathing  german schaden  dutch schade   24  the second segment of the name has been reconstructed as *awj u014d  meaning  land on the water  or  island   the name scandinavia would then mean  dangerous island   which is considered to refer to the treacherous sandbanks surrounding scania  24  skan xf6r in scania  with its long falsterbo reef  has the same stem  skan  combined with - xf6r  which means  sandbanks    in the reconstructed germanic root *ska xf0in-awj u014d  the edh represented in latin by t or d   the first segment is sometimes considered more uncertain than the second segment  the american heritage dictionary 25  derives the second segment from proto-indo-european  akwa-   water   in the sense of  watery land    the old norse goddess name ska xf0i  along with sca n dinavia and sk xe1ney  may be related to gothic skadus  old english sceadu  old saxon scado  and old high german scato  meaning  shadow    scholar john mckinnell comments that this etymology suggests that the goddess ska xf0i may have once been a personification of the geographical region of scandinavia or associated with the underworld  26   pliny s descriptions of scatinavia and surrounding areas are not always easy to decipher  writing in the capacity of a roman admiral  he introduces the northern region by declaring to his roman readers that there are 23 islands  romanis armis cognitae    known to roman arms   in this area  according to pliny  the  clarissima    most famous   of the region s islands is scatinavia  of unknown size  there live the hilleviones  the belief that scandinavia was an island became widespread among classical authors during the first century and dominated descriptions of scandinavia in classical texts during the centuries that followed   pliny begins his description of the route to scatinavia by referring to the mountain of saevo  mons saevo ibi   the codanus bay  codanus sinus  and the cimbrian promontory  27  the geographical features have been identified in various ways  by some scholars  saevo  is thought to be the mountainous norwegian coast at the entrance to skagerrak and the cimbrian peninsula is thought to be skagen  the north tip of jutland  denmark  as described  saevo and scatinavia can also be the same place   pliny mentions scandinavia one more time  in book viii he says that the animal called achlis  given in the accusative  achlin  which is not latin   was born on the island of scandinavia  28  the animal grazes  has a big upper lip and some mythical attributes   the name  scandia   later used as a synonym for scandinavia  also appears in pliny s naturalis historia  but is used for a group of northern european islands which he locates north of britannia   scandia  thus does not appear to be denoting the island scadinavia in pliny s text  the idea that  scadinavia  may have been one of the  scandiae  islands was instead introduced by ptolemy  c  90 \u2013 c  168\xa0ad   a mathematician  geographer and astrologer of roman egypt  he used the name  skandia  for the biggest  most easterly of the three  scandiai  islands  which according to him were all located east of jutland  24   neither pliny s nor ptolemy s lists of scandinavian tribes include the suiones mentioned by tacitus  some early swedish scholars of the swedish hyperborean school 29  and of the 19th-century romantic nationalism period proceeded to synthesize the different versions by inserting references to the suiones  arguing that they must have been referred to in the original texts and obscured over time by spelling mistakes or various alterations  30][31   the latin names in pliny s text gave rise to different forms in medieval germanic texts  in jordanes  history of the goths  ad 551  the form scandza is the name used for their original home  separated by sea from the land of europe  chapter 1  4).[32  where jordanes meant to locate this quasi-legendary island is still a hotly debated issue  both in scholarly discussions and in the nationalistic discourse of various european countries  33][34  the form scadinavia as the original home of the langobards appears in paulus diaconus  historia langobardorum  35  in other versions of historia langobardorum appear the forms scadan  scandanan  scadanan and scatenauge  36  frankish sources used sconaowe and aethelweard  an anglo-saxon historian  used scani  37][38  in beowulf  the forms scedenige and scedeland are used  while the alfredian translation of orosius and wulfstan s travel accounts used the old english sconeg  38   the earliest sami yoik texts written down refer to the world as skadesi-suolo  north-sami  and ska u0111su xe2l  east-sami   meaning "ska xf0i s island   svennung 1963   svennung considers the sami name to have been introduced as a loan word from the north germanic languages  39  "ska xf0i  is the giant stepmother of freyr and freyja in norse mythology  it has been suggested that ska xf0i to some extent is modeled on a sami woman  the name for skade s father thjazi is known in sami as \u010c xe1hci   the waterman   and her son with odin  saeming  can be interpreted as a descendent of saam the sami population  mundel 2000),[40   steinsland 1991).[41  older joik texts give evidence of the old sami belief about living on an island and state that the wolf is known as suolu gievra  meaning  the strong one on the island   the sami place name sulliid u010dielbma means  the island s threshold  and suolo u010dielgi means  the island s back    in recent substrate studies  sami linguists have examined the initial cluster sk- in words used in sami and concluded that sk- is a phonotactic structure of alien origin  42   another possibility is that all or part of the segments of the name came from the mesolithic people inhabiting the region  43  in modernity  scandinavia is a peninsula  but between approximately 10,300 and 9,500 years ago  the southern part of scandinavia was an island separated from the northern peninsula  with water exiting the baltic sea through the area where stockholm is now located  44   some basque scholars have presented the idea that the segment sk that appears in *ska xf0inawj u014d is connected to the name for the euzko peoples  akin to basques  that populated paleolithic europe  according to some of these intellects  scandinavian people share particular genetic markers with the basque people  43   the geography of scandinavia is extremely varied  notable are the norwegian fjords  the scandinavian mountains  the flat  low areas in denmark  and the archipelagos of sweden and norway  sweden has many lakes and moraines  legacies of the ice age   the climate varies from north to south and from west to east  a marine west coast climate  cfb  typical of western europe dominates in denmark  southernmost part of sweden and along the west coast of norway reaching north to 65\xb0n  with orographic lift giving more mm year precipitation (&lt 5000\xa0mm  in some areas in western norway  the central part \u2013 from oslo to stockholm \u2013 has a humid continental climate  dfb   which gradually gives way to subarctic climate  dfc  further north and cool marine west coast climate  cfc  along the northwestern coast  a small area along the northern coast east of the north cape has tundra climate  et  as a result of a lack of summer warmth  the scandinavian mountains block the mild and moist air coming from the southwest  thus northern sweden and the finnmarksvidda plateau in norway receive little precipitation and have cold winters  large areas in the scandinavian mountains have alpine tundra climate   the warmest temperature ever recorded in scandinavia is 38.0\xa0\xb0c in m xe5lilla (sweden   45  the coldest temperature ever recorded is \u221252.6\xa0\xb0c in vuoggatj xe5lme (sweden   46  the coldest

tafjord has recorded 17.9\xa0\xb0c in january and sunndal 18.9\xa0\xb0c in february   two language groups have coexisted on the scandinavian peninsula since prehistory u2014the north germanic languages  scandinavian languages  and the sami languages  47  due to later migrations  finnish  yiddish and romani have also been spoken for over a hundred years  denmark also has a minority of german-speakers  more recent migrations has added even more languages  apart from sami and the languages of minority groups speaking a variant of the majority language of a neighboring state  the following minority languages in scandinavia are protected under the european charter for regional or minority languages  yiddish  romani chib  romanes and romani   the north germanic languages of scandinavia are traditionally divided into an east scandinavian branch  danish and swedish  and a west scandinavian branch  norwegian  icelandic  and faroese   48][49  but because of changes appearing in the languages since 1600  the east scandinavian and west scandinavian branches are now usually reconfigured into insular scandinavian (\xf6-nordisk  xf8y-nordisk  featuring icelandic and faroese 50  and continental scandinavian  skandinavisk   comprising danish  norwegian  and swedish  51  the modern division is based on the degree of mutual comprehensibility between the languages in the two branches  52  the populations of the scandinavian countries  with a scandinavian mother tongue  can u2014at least with some training u2014understand each other s standard languages as they appear in print and are heard on radio and television   the reason danish  swedish and the two official written versions of norwegian  nynorsk and bokm xe5l  are traditionally viewed as different languages  rather than dialects of one common language  is that each is a well-established standard language in its respective country  danish  swedish and norwegian have  since medieval times  been influenced to varying degrees by middle low german and standard german  a substantial amount of that influence was a by-product of the economic activity generated by the hanseatic league   norwegians are accustomed to variation  and may perceive danish and swedish only as slightly more distant dialects  this is because they have two official written standards  in addition to the habit of strongly holding on to local dialects  the people of stockholm  sweden and copenhagen  denmark  have the greatest difficulty in understanding other scandinavian languages  53  in the faroe islands and iceland  learning danish is mandatory  this causes faroese people as well as icelandic people to become bilingual in two very distinct north germanic languages  making it relatively easy for them to understand the other two mainland scandinavian languages  54][55   although iceland was under the political control of denmark until a much later date (1918   very little influence and borrowing from danish has occurred in the icelandic language  56  icelandic remained the preferred language among the ruling classes in iceland  danish was not used for official communications  most of the royal officials were of icelandic descent and the language of the church and law courts remained icelandic  57   the scandinavian languages are  as a language family  entirely unrelated to finnish  estonian  and sami languages  which as uralic languages are distantly related to hungarian  owing to the close proximity  there is still a great deal of borrowing from the swedish and norwegian languages in the finnish and sami languages  58  the long history of linguistic influence of swedish on finnish is also due to the fact that finnish  the language of the majority in finland  was treated as a minority language while finland was part of sweden  finnish-speakers had to learn swedish in order to advance to higher positions  59  swedish spoken in today s finland includes a lot of words that are borrowed from finnish  whereas the written language remains closer to that of sweden   finland is officially bilingual  with finnish and swedish having mostly the same status at national level  finland s majority population are finns  whose mother tongue is either finnish  approximately 95    swedish or both  the swedish speaking minority lives mainly on the coast from the city of porvoo  in the gulf of finland  to the city of kokkola  up in the bothnian bay  the \xc5land islands  an autonomous province of finland  situated in the baltic sea between finland and sweden  is entirely swedish speaking  children are taught the other official language at school  for swedish-speakers  this is finnish  usually from the 3rd grade   and for finnish-speakers  swedish  usually from the 3rd  5th or 7th grade    finnish speakers constitute a language minority in sweden and norway  there are also languages derived from finnish  having evolved separately  known as me xe4nkieli in sweden and kven in norway   the sami languages are indigenous minority languages in scandinavia  60  they belong to their own branch of the uralic language family and are unrelated to the north germanic languages other than by limited grammatical  particularly lexical  characteristics resulting from prolonged contact  58  sami is divided into several languages or dialects  61  consonant gradation is a feature in both finnish and northern sami dialects  but it is not present in south sami  which is considered to have a different language history  according to the sami information centre of the sami parliament in sweden  southern sami may have originated in an earlier migration from the south into the scandinavian peninsula  58   during a period of christianization and state formation in the 10th u201313th centuries  numerous germanic petty kingdoms and chiefdoms were unified into three kingdoms   the three scandinavian kingdoms joined in 1387 in the kalmar union under queen margaret i of denmark  sweden left the union in 1523 under king gustav vasa  in the aftermath of sweden s secession from the kalmar union  civil war broke out in denmark and norway  the protestant reformation followed  when things had settled  the norwegian privy council was abolished u2014it assembled for the last time in 1537  a personal union  entered into by the kingdoms of denmark and norway in 1536  lasted until 1814  three sovereign successor states have subsequently emerged from this unequal union  denmark  norway and iceland   the borders between the three countries got the shape they have had since in the middle of the seventeenth century  in the 1645 treaty of br xf6msebro  denmark u2013norway ceded the norwegian provinces of j xe4mtland  h xe4rjedalen and idre  amp  s xe4rna  as well as the baltic sea islands of gotland and \xd6sel  in estonia  to sweden  the treaty of roskilde  signed in 1658  forced denmark u2013norway to cede the danish provinces scania  blekinge  halland  bornholm and the norwegian provinces of b xe5huslen and tr xf8ndelag to sweden  the 1660 treaty of copenhagen forced sweden to return bornholm and tr xf8ndelag to denmark u2013norway  and to give up its recent claims to the island funen  63   in the east  finland  was a fully incorporated part of sweden since medieval times until the napoleonic wars  when it was ceded to russia  scandinavia has  despite many wars over the years since the formation of the three kingdoms  been politically and culturally close   denmark u2013norway as a historiographical name refers to the former political union consisting of the kingdoms of denmark and norway  including the norwegian dependencies of iceland  greenland and the faroe islands  the corresponding adjective and demonym is dano-norwegian  during danish rule  norway kept its separate laws  coinage and army  as well as some institutions such as a royal chancellor  norway s old royal line had died out with the death of olav iv 64  in 1387  but norway s remaining a hereditary kingdom became an important factor for the oldenburg dynasty of denmark u2013norway in its struggles to win elections as kings of denmark   the treaty of kiel (14 january 1814  formally dissolved the dano-norwegian union and ceded the territory of norway proper to the king of sweden  but denmark retained norway s overseas possessions  however  widespread norwegian resistance to the prospect of a union with sweden induced the governor of norway  crown prince christian frederick  later christian viii of denmark   to call a constituent assembly at eidsvoll in april 1814  the assembly drew up a liberal constitution and elected christian frederick to the throne of norway  following a swedish invasion during the summer  the peace conditions of the convention of moss (14 august 1814  specified that king christian frederik had to resign  but norway would keep its independence and its constitution within a personal union with sweden  christian frederik formally abdicated on 10 august 1814 and returned to denmark  the norwegian parliament storting elected king charles xiii of sweden as king of norway on 4 november   the storting dissolved the union between sweden and norway in 1905  after which the norwegians elected prince charles of denmark as king of norway  he reigned as haakon vii   the modern use of the term scandinavia has been influenced by scandinavism  the scandinavist political movement   which was active in the middle of the nineteenth century  mainly between the first schleswig war (1848\u20131850   in which sweden and norway contributed with considerable military force  and the second schleswig war (1864    the swedish king also proposed a unification of denmark  norway and sweden into a single united kingdom  the background for the proposal was the tumultuous events during the napoleonic wars in the beginning of the century  this war resulted in finland  formerly the eastern third of sweden  becoming the russian grand duchy of finland in 1809 and norway  de jure in union with denmark since 1387  although de facto treated as a province  becoming independent in 1814  but thereafter swiftly forced to accept a personal union with sweden  the dependent territories iceland  the faroe islands and greenland  historically part of norway  remained with denmark in accordance with the treaty of kiel  sweden and norway were thus united under the swedish monarch  but finland s inclusion in the russian empire excluded any possibility for a political union between finland and any of the other nordic countries   the end of the scandinavian political movement came when denmark was denied the military support promised from sweden and norway to annex the  danish  duchy of schleswig  which together with the  german  duchy of holstein had been in personal union with denmark  the second war of schleswig followed in 1864  a brief but disastrous war between denmark and prussia  supported by austria   schleswig-holstein was conquered by prussia  and after prussia s success in the franco-prussian war a prussian-led german empire was created  and a new power-balance of the baltic sea countries was established   even if a scandinavian political union never came about at this point  there was a scandinavian monetary union established in 1873  lasting until world war i
