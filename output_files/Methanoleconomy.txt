Methanoleconomy
 the methanol economy is a suggested future economy in which methanol and dimethyl ether replace fossil fuels as a means of energy storage  ground transportation fuel  and raw material for synthetic hydrocarbons and their products  it offers an alternative to the proposed hydrogen economy or ethanol economy   in the 1990s  nobel prize winner george a  olah advocated a methanol economy  1][2][3  in 2006  he and two co-authors  g  k  surya prakash and alain goeppert  published a summary of the state of fossil fuel and alternative energy sources  including their availability and limitations  before suggesting a methanol economy  4   methanol can be produced from a wide variety of sources including still-abundant fossil fuels  natural gas  coal  oil shale  tar sands  etc   as well as agricultural products and municipal waste  wood and varied biomass  it can also be made from chemical recycling of carbon dioxide       methanol is a fuel for heat engines and fuel cells  due to its high octane rating it can be used directly as a fuel in flex-fuel cars  including hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles  using existing internal combustion engines  ice   methanol can also be used as a fuel in fuel cells  either directly in direct methanol fuel cells  dmfc  or indirectly  after conversion into hydrogen by reforming    in an economy based on methanol  methanol could be used as a fuel   methanol is already used today on a large scale as raw material to produce a variety of chemicals and products  through the methanol-to-gasoline  mtg  process  it can be transformed into gasoline  using the methanol-to-olefin  mto  process  methanol can also be converted to ethylene and propylene  the two chemicals produced in largest amounts by the petrochemical industry  6  these are important building blocks for the production of essential polymers  ldpe  hdpe  pp  and like other chemical intermediates are currently produced mainly from petroleum feedstock  their production from methanol could therefore reduce our dependency on petroleum  it would also make it possible to continue producing these chemicals when fossil fuels reserves are depleted   methanol is already used today on a large scale  about 37 million tonnes per year  7  as feedstock to produce numerous chemical products and materials  in addition  it can be readily converted in the methanol-to-olefin  mto  process into ethylene and propylene  industrial chemicals which can be used to produce synthetic hydrocarbons and their products  currently obtained from oil and natural gas   today most methanol is produced from methane through syngas  trinidad and tobago is currently the world s largest methanol exporter  with exports mainly to the united states  8  the natural gas that serves as feedstock for the production of methanol comes from the same sources as other uses  unconventional gas resources such as coalbed methane  tight sand gas and eventually the very large methane hydrate resources present under the continental shelves of the seas and siberian and canadian tundra could also be used to provide the necessary gas   the conventional route to methanol from methane passes through syngas generation by steam reforming combined  or not  with partial oxidation  new and more efficient ways to convert methane into methanol are also being developed  these include   all these synthetic routes emit the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide co2  to mitigate this  methanol can be made through ways minimizing the emission of co2  one solution is to produce it from syngas obtained by biomass gasification  for this purpose any biomass can be used including wood  wood wastes  grass  agricultural crops and their by-products  animal waste  aquatic plants and municipal waste  there is no need to use food crops as in the case of ethanol from corn  sugar cane and wheat   methanol can be synthesized from carbon and hydrogen from any source  including still available fossil fuels and biomass  co2 emitted from fossil fuel burning power plants and other industries and eventually even the co2 contained in the air  can be a source of carbon  it can also be made from chemical recycling of carbon dioxide  which carbon recycling international has demonstrated with its first commercial scale plant  9  initially the major source will be the co2 rich flue gases of fossil-fuel-burning power plants or exhaust from cement and other factories  in the longer range however  considering diminishing fossil fuel resources and the effect of their utilization on earth s atmosphere  even the low concentration of atmospheric co2 itself could be captured and recycled via methanol  thus supplementing nature u2019s own photosynthetic cycle  efficient new absorbents to capture atmospheric co2 are being developed  mimicking plants  ability  chemical recycling of co2 to new fuels and materials could thus become feasible  making them renewable on the human timescale   methanol can also be produced from co2 by catalytic hydrogenation of co2 with h2 where the hydrogen has been obtained from water electrolysis  this is the process used by carbon recycling international of iceland  methanol may also be produced through co2 electrochemical reduction  if electrical power is available  the energy needed for these reactions in order to be carbon neutral would come from renewable energy sources such as wind  hydroelectricity and solar as well as nuclear power  in effect  all of them allow free energy to be stored in easily transportable methanol  which is made immediately from hydrogen and carbon dioxide  rather than attempting to store energy in free hydrogen   or with electric energy  the necessary co2 would be captured from fossil fuel burning power plants and other industrial flue gases including cement factories  with diminishing fossil fuel resources and therefore co2 emissions  the co2 content in the air could also be used  considering the low concentration of co2 in air (0.04   improved and economically viable technologies to absorb co2 will have to be developed  this would allow the chemical recycling of co2  thus mimicking nature u2019s photosynthesis   in the process of photosynthesis  green plants use the energy of sunlight to split water into free oxygen  which is released  and free hydrogen  rather than attempt to store the hydrogen  plants immediately capture carbon dioxide from the air to allow the hydrogen to reduce it to storable fuels such as hydrocarbons  plant oils and terpenes  and polyalcohols  glycerol  sugars and starches   in the methanol economy  any process which similarly produces free hydrogen  proposes to immediately use it  captively  to reduce carbon dioxide into methanol  which  like plant products from photosynthesis  has great advantages in storage and transport over free hydrogen itself   methanol is a liquid under normal conditions  allowing it to be stored  transported and dispensed easily  much like gasoline and diesel fuel  it can also be readily transformed by dehydration into dimethyl ether  a diesel fuel substitute with a cetane number of 55   methanol economy advantages compared to a hydrogen economy
