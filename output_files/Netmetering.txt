Netmetering
 net metering  or net energy metering  nem  allows consumers who generate some or all of their own electricity to use that electricity anytime  instead of when it is generated  this is particularly important with wind and solar  which are non-dispatchable  monthly net metering allows consumers to use solar power generated during the day at night  or wind from a windy day later in the month  annual net metering rolls over a net kilowatt credit to the following month  allowing solar power that was generated in july to be used in december  or wind power from march in august   net metering policies can vary significantly by country and by state or province  if net metering is available  if and how long banked credits can be retained  and how much the credits are worth  retail wholesale   most net metering laws involve monthly roll over of kwh credits  a small monthly connection fee  1  require monthly payment of deficits  i e  normal electric bill   and annual settlement of any residual credit  unlike a feed-in tariff  fit   which requires two meters  net metering uses a single  bi-directional meter and can measure current flowing in two directions  2  net metering can be implemented solely as an accounting procedure  and requires no special metering  or even any prior arrangement or notification  3   net metering is an enabling policy designed to foster private investment in renewable energy       net metering originated in the united states  where small wind turbines and solar panels were connected to the electrical grid  and consumers wanted to be able to use the electricity generated at a different time or date from when it was generated  minnesota is commonly cited as passing the first net metering law  in 1983  and allowed anyone generating less than 40\xa0kw to either roll over any kilowatt credit to the next month  or be paid for the excess  in 2000 this was amended to compensation  at the average retail utility energy rate   this is the simplest and most general interpretation of net metering  and in addition allows small producers to sell electricity at the retail rate  4   utilities in idaho adopted net metering in 1980  and in arizona in 1981  massachusetts adopted net metering in 1982  by 1998  22 states or utilities therein had adopted net metering  two california utilities initially adopted a monthly  net metering  charge  which included a  standby charge   until the puc banned such charges  5  in 2005  all u s  utilities were required to offer net metering  upon request   excess generation is not addressed  as of 2017 43 u s  states have adopted net metering  as well as utilities in 3 of the remaining states  leaving only 4 states without any established procedures for implementing net metering  6   net metering was slow to be adopted in europe  especially in the united kingdom  because of confusion over how to address the value added tax  vat   only one utility company in great britain offers net metering  7   the united kingdom government is reluctant to introduce the net metering principle because of complications in paying and refunding the value added tax that is payable on electricity  but pilot projects are underway in some areas   in canada  some provinces have net metering programs   in the philippines  net metering scheme is governed by republic act 9513  renewable energy act of 2008  and it s implementing rules and regulation  irr   the implementing body is the energy regulatory commission  erc  in consultation with the national renewable energy board  nreb   unfortunately  the scheme is not a true net metering scheme but in reality a net billing scheme  as the dept of energy s net metering guidelines say     \u201cnet-metering allows customers of distribution utilities  dus  to install an on-site renewable energy  re  facility not exceeding 100 kilowatts  kw  in capacity so they can generate electricity for their own use  any electricity generated that is not consumed by the customer is automatically exported to the du u2019s distribution system  the du then gives a peso credit for the excess electricity received equivalent to the du u2019s blended generation cost  excluding other generation adjustments  and deducts the credits earned to the customer u2019s electric bill  u201d [8   thus philippine consumers who generate their own electricity and sell their surplus to the utility are paid what is called the  generation cost  which is often less than 50  of the retail price of electricity   net metering is controversial as it affects different interests on the grid  9  a report prepared by peter kind of energy infrastructure advocates for the trade association edison electric institute stated that distributed generation systems  like rooftop solar  present unique challenges to the future of electric utilities  10  utilities in the united states have led a largely unsuccessful campaign to eliminate net metering 11   renewable advocates point out that while distributed solar and other energy efficiency measures do pose a challenge to electric utilities  existing business model  the benefits of distributed generation outweigh the costs  and those benefits are shared by all ratepayers  12  grid benefits of private distributed solar investment include reduced need for centralizing power plants and reduced strain on the utility grid  they also point out that  as a cornerstone policy enabling the growth of rooftop solar  net metering creates a host of societal benefits for all ratepayers that are generally not accounted for by the utility analysis  including  public health benefits  employment and downstream economic effects  market price impacts  grid security benefits  and water savings  13   an independent report conducted by the consulting firm crossborder energy found that the benefits of california s net metering program outweigh the costs to ratepayers  those net benefits will amount to more than us 92 million annually upon the completion of the current net metering program  14   a 2012 report on the cost of net metering in the state of california  commissioned by the california public utilities commission  cpuc   showed that those customers without distributed generation systems will pay us 287 in additional costs to use and maintain the grid every year by 2020  the report also showed the net cost will amount to us 1.1 billion by 2020.[15  notably  the same report found that solar customers do pay more on their power bills than what it costs the utility to serve them  table 5  page 10  average 103  of their cost of service across the three major utilities in 2011).[15   many electric utilities state that owners of generation systems do not pay the full cost of service to use the grid  thus shifting their share of the cost on to customers without distributed generation systems  16  most owners of rooftop solar or other types of distributed generation systems still rely on the grid to receive electricity from utilities at night or when their systems cannot generate sufficient power  17   a 2014 report funded by the institute for electric innovation 18  reveals that net metering in california produces excessively large subsidies for typical residential rooftop solar pv facilities  these subsidies must then be paid for by other residential customers  most of whom are less affluent than the rooftop solar pv customers  in addition  the report points out that most of these large subsidies go to the solar leasing companies  which accounted for about 75 percent of the solar pv facilities installed in 2013  the report concludes that changes are needed in california  ranging from the adoption of retail tariffs that are more cost-reflective to replacing net metering with a separate  buy all - sell all  arrangement that requires all rooftop solar pv customers to buy all of their consumed energy under the existing retail tariffs and separately sell all of their onsite generation to their distribution utilities at the utilities  respective avoided costs  19   there is considerable confusion between the terms  net metering  and  feed-in tariff   in general there are three types of compensation for local  distributed generation   net metering only requires one meter  a feed-in tariff requires two   time of use  tou  net metering employs a special reversible smart  electric  meter that is programmed to determine electricity usage any time during the day  time-of-use allows utility rates and charges to be assessed based on when the electricity was used  i e   day night and seasonal rates   typically the generation cost of electricity is highest during the daytime peak usage period  and lowest at night  time of use metering is a significant issue for renewable-energy sources  since  for example  solar power systems tend to produce energy during the daytime peak-price period  and produce little or no power during the night period  when price is low  italy has installed so many photovoltaic cells that peak prices no longer are during the day  but are instead in the evening  20  tou net metering affects the apparent cost of net metering to a utility  21   in market rate net metering systems the user s energy use is priced dynamically according to some function of wholesale electric prices  the users  meters are programmed remotely to calculate the value and are read remotely  net metering applies such variable pricing to excess power produced by a qualifying system   market rate metering systems were implemented in california starting in 2006  and under the terms of california s net metering rules will be applicable to qualifying photovoltaic and wind systems  under california law the payback for surplus electricity sent to the grid must be equal to the  variable  in this case  price charged at that time   net metering enables small systems to result in zero annual net cost to the consumer provided that the consumer is able to shift demand loads to a lower price time  such as by chilling water at a low cost time for later use in air conditioning  or by charging a battery electric vehicle during off-peak times  while the electricity generated at peak demand time can be sent to the grid rather than used locally  see vehicle-to-grid   no credit is given for annual surplus production   excess generation is a separate issue from net metering  but it is normally dealt with in the same rules  because it can arise  if local generation offsets a portion of the demand  net metering is not used  if local generation exceeds demand some of the time  for example during the day  net metering is used  if local generation exceeds demand for the billing cycle  best practices calls for a perpetual roll over of the kilowatt credits  although some regions have considered having any kilowatt credits expire after 36 months  the normal definition of excess generation is annually  although the term is equally applicable monthly  the treatment of annual excess generation  and monthly  ranges from lost  to compensation at avoided cost  to compensation at retail rate  22  left over kilowatt credits upon termination of service would ideally be paid at retail rate  from the consumer standpoint  and lost  from the utility standpoint  with avoided cost a minimum compromise  some regions allow optional payment for excess annual generation  23  which allows perpetual roll over or payment  at the customers choice  both wind and solar are inherently seasonal  and it is highly likely to use up a surplus later  unless more solar panels or a larger wind turbine have been installed than needed   net metering systems can have energy storage integrated  to store some of the power locally  i e  from the renewable energy source connected to the system  rather than selling everything back to the mains electricity grid  often  the batteries used are industrial deep cycle batteries as these last for 10 to 20 years  24  lead-acid batteries are often also still used  but last much less long (5 years or so   lithium-ion batteries are sometimes also used  but too have a relatively short lifespan  finally  nickel-iron batteries 25  last the longest with a lifespan of up to 40 years  26][27][28  a 2017 study of solar panels with battery storage indicated an 8 to 14 percent extra consumption of electricity from charging and discharging batteries  29   in some australian states  the  feed-in tariff  is actually net metering  except that it pays monthly for net generation at a higher rate than retail  with environment victoria campaigns director mark wakeham calling it a  fake feed-in tariff   30  a feed-in tariff requires a separate meter  and pays for all local generation at a preferential rate  while net metering requires only one meter  the financial differences are very substantial   in victoria  from 2009  householders were paid 60 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid  this was around three times the retail price for electricity at that time  however  subsequent state governments reduced the feed-in in several updates  until in 2016 the feed-in is as low as 5 cents per kilowatt hour   in queensland starting in 2008  the solar bonus scheme pays 44 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid  this is around three times the current retail price for electricity  however  from 2012  the queensland feed in tariff has been reduced to 6-10 cents per kilowatt hour depending on which electricity retailer the customer has signed up with   ontario allows net metering for up to 500\xa0kw  however credits can only be carried for 12 consecutive months  should a consumer establish a credit where they generate more than they consume for 8 months and use up the credits in the 10th month  then the 12-month period begins again from the date that the next credit is shown on an invoice  any unused credits remaining at the end of 12 consecutive months of a consumer being in a credit situation are cleared at the end of that billing  31   areas of british columbia serviced by bc hydro are allowed net metering for up to 50\xa0kw  at each annual anniversary the customer was paid 8.16 cents 32  per kwh  if there is a net export of power after each 12-month period  which was increased to 9.99 cents kwh  effective june 1  2012  systems over 50\xa0kw are covered under the standing offer program  33][34  fortisbc which serves an area in south central bc also allows net-metering for up to 50\xa0kw  customers are paid their existing retail rate for any net energy they produce  35  the city of new westminster  which has its own electrical utility  does not currently allow net metering   new brunswick allows net metering for installations up to 100\xa0kw  credits from excess generated power can be carried over until march at which time any excess credits are lost  [36   saskpower allows net metering for installations up to 100\xa0kw  credits from excess generated power can be carried over until the customer s annual anniversary date  at which time any excess credits are lost   denmark established net-metering for privately owned pv systems in mid-1998 for a pilot-period of four years  in 2002 the net-metering scheme was extended another four years up to end of 2006  net-metering has proved to be a cheap  easy to administer and effective way of stimulating the deployment of pv in denmark  however the relative short time window of the arrangement has so far prevented it from reaching its full potential  during the political negotiations in the fall of 2005 the net-metering for privately owned pv systems was made permanent  37   the netherlands has net-metering since 2004.[38  initially there was a limit of 3000kwh per year  later this limit was increased to 5000kwh  the limit was removed altogether on january 1  2014.[39   italy offers a support scheme  mixing net-metering and a well segmented premium fit  40   slovenia has annual net-metering since january 2016 for up to 11 kva  in a calendar year up to 10 mva can be installed in the country  41   in 2010 spain  net-metering has been proposed by the asociaci xf3n de la industria fotovoltaica  asif  to promote renewable electricity  without requiring additional economic support  42  but net-metering for privately owned systems is not yet established   some form of net metering is now proposed by \xc9lectricit xe9 de france  according to their website  energy produced by home-owners is bought at a higher price than what is charged as consumers  hence  some recommend to sell all energy produced  and buy back all energy needed at a lower price  the price has been fixed for 20 years by the government  43][44   net metering was pioneered in the united states as a way to allow solar and wind to provide electricity whenever available and allow use of that electricity whenever it was needed  beginning with utilities in idaho in 1980  and in arizona in 1981.[5  in 1983  minnesota passed the first state net metering law  4  as of march 2015  44 states and washington  d c  have developed mandatory net metering rules for at least some utilities  45   net metering policies are determined by states  which have set policies varying on a number of key dimensions  the energy policy act of 2005 required state electricity regulators to  consider   but not necessarily implement  rules that mandate public electric utilities make available upon request net metering to their customers  46  several legislative bills have been proposed to institute a federal standard limit on net metering  they range from h r  729  which sets a net metering cap at 2  of forecasted aggregate customer peak demand  to h r  1945 which has no aggregate cap  but does limit residential users to 10\xa0kw  a low limit compared to many states  such as new mexico  with an 80,000\xa0kw limit  or states such as arizona  colorado  new jersey  and ohio which limit as a percentage of load  47   arizona  california  colorado  connecticut  delaware  maryland  massachusetts  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  ohio  oregon  pennsylvania  utah  vermont  and west virginia are considered the most favorable states for net metering  as they are the only states to receive an  a  rating from freeing the grid in 2015.[48   regulators in multiple states are acting as \u201creferees u201d in debates between utility companies and advocates of distributed resources  such as solar panel arrays  in 2016 the national association of regulatory utility commissioners  naruc  published the manual on distributed energy resources compensation as a way to help states decide on rate structures dealing with homes and businesses that generate their own power and send excess power back to the electric grid  the intention behind the manual is to  provide a consistent framework for evaluating rate design decisions in the age of distributed energy resources   49  the president of naruc  when he commissioned the manual  said his instructions to the committee writing the manual were to write a  practical  expert and most importantly ideologically neutral guide that offers advice  to states  49  a draft of the manual was released in july  which generated more than 70 public comments from stakeholder groups  those comments were reviewed  and the final version of the manual was designed  the updated manual covers various issues that state regulators have been struggling with including net metering  the value of solar energy  and cost shifting from der to non-der customers  der is being integrated into the national grid at a rapid pace  and the system of electricity generation  delivery  and utilization are constantly changing with new technology  50   the edison electric institute and the solar energy industries association both supported the manual  however  the main point of contention between utility companies and the solar industry is the question of whether distributed generation systems represent cost shift from those with the systems  people with solar panels  to those without them  everyone else who uses electricity   49   phil moeller of the edison electric institute said   we want to der  distributed energy resources  but we want to make sure the rate structure is right to minimize cost shifts   49  moeller is a former member of the federal energy regulatory commission  ferc   a federal government regulatory agency  sean gallaher of the solar energy industries association said   there seems to be an assumption that revenue erosion from der results in an inadequacy of cost recovery for the utility and therefore a shift of costs to non-participating customers  you can u2019t just assume that   49   note  some additional minor variations not listed in this table may

green mountain energy  green mountain energy is not a utility but a retail electric provider  according to www powertochoose com   54   in late 2015  three utilities in california proposed alternative methods of compensation to solar users for the excess energy recycled back to the grid  this follows new regulatory decisions on solar net metering policies  in december 2015  a policy that would protect retail net metering for rooftop solar consumers was proposed by the california public utilities commission  cpuc   when asked for their commentary  the utilities responded with lower remuneration rates for solar consumers in exchange for contributing to grid upkeep costs  55   in an attempt to establish fairness and balance between solar installers and utilities  the cpuc proposed to continue with retail rate net metering with minimal changes for rooftop solar customers in california  according to the los angeles times  solar energy supporters rallied at a hearing at cpuc vowing to \u201cgut u201d net metering and complicate newly proposed utility policies  california utilities were dissatisfied with the proposal  according to san diego gas  amp  electric  the proposal did not address the \u201cgrowing cost burden u201d on their customers  which is estimated at $100 per month or  collectively  $160 million per year  55   a proposal set forth by the utilities offered to charge both residential and commercial net metering customers their \u201cotherwise applicable rate u201d for the kwh u2019s of electricity used from the grid  a fixed export compensation rate for exported energy over a 10-year period would also be imposed  the export rate would amount to $0.15 kwh for installations until the distributed power exceeded 7  of the utility u2019s customer demand  subsequently  the rate would fall to $0.13/kwh  55   in early 2016  lawmakers in florida  with encouragement from both houses  voted to put amendment 4 on the ballot  in a state that is presently faced with various renewable energy issues  the idea of terminating personal property taxes on solar panels was widely supported  one of the sponsor u2019s of the bill backing amendment 4  state senator jeff brandes  r   said that the decision will aid in the development of renewable and solar energy statewide and lead to the creation of thousands of job opportunities  56   on august 30  2016  a proposition that will dispose of property taxes on both commercial and industrial solar panels was approved by florida voters  the initiative to revitalize renewable energy efforts garnered overwhelming bipartisan support  according to florida politics  on august 30  2016  amendment 4 accumulated almost 75 percent of the votes cast  surpassing the 60 percent minimum required  the ongoing debate regarding solar energy remains a major issue  with utility-supported policies expected to face scrutiny and resistance  56   in the maine legislature  assistant majority leader sara gideon  d-freeport  introduced a new bill to increase maine u2019s solar industry tenfold and implement a market-based program  replacing the current net metering policy  in 2015-2016 in maine  a collective group of environmentalists  consumer representatives  installers of solar power  and utilities proposed a bill in the state legislature suggesting the replacement of net metering with a market-based \u201cpay for production u201d program  one provision of the bill proposes that central maine power  cmp  and emera  maine u2019s two main utilities  establish long-term contracts with utility developers and solar owners allowing them to purchase solar power generation  subsequently  they would bid the generation into new england electricity markets  this arrangement could last existing net metering customers up to 12 years  a competitively set regulated price would be paid by the aggregators in order to compensate for owner costs  in turn  the utility aggregators would capitalize on the return on sales  57   in maine  the two major issues regarding retail rates and net metering programs were how to deal with cmp reaching 1 percent of peak load net metering cap and the real value of solar  the alliance for solar choice stated that it would prefer to see net metering kept intact until the policy produces solar growth  57   in january 2017  the energy and technology interim committee  etic  in the montana legislature passed hb 52  a bill which grandfathers net metering rates to solar customers  the bill passed with unanimous support  the bill was supported by northwestern energy  however  a second bill did not have as much success  bill hb 34 would have raised the net metering cap from 50\xa0kw to 250\xa0kw for government buildings  58   as of february 2017  the net metering policy in montana gives credits on energy bills for energy produced that flows back to the grid for customers with wind  solar  or hydropower systems  the credits given to customers are equivalent to the retail rate of electricity  59   there are at least two bills in the state legislature that would change that rate  senate bill 7  sponsored by sen  pat connell  r-hamilton  would ban net metering customers from being subsidized other customers of the utility company  senate bill 78  sponsored by sen  keith regier  r-kalispell  would require the montana public service commission to create a separate rate class for net metering customers by january 1  2018  under the bill  power produced by net metering customers would be valued at the wholesale rate and net metering customers to pay a monthly service charge to help pay for the fixed costs of the public utility s operation  59   the state of nevada implemented net metering in 1997.[60  up until 2016  utility companies in nevada paid the retail electricity rate to net metering consumers  61  nevada u2019s utilities pay net metering customers an average of $623 per year in southern nevada and $471 per year in northern nevada  61   the major utility company in nevada is nv energy  60][62    the nevada legislature passed legislation in 2015 that required the nevada public utilities commission to study the electric rate structure and come up with ways to shift costs  63  in december 2015  the commission updated the regulations so that utility companies would pay the wholesale rate to net metering consumers  62   the group greenpeace and senator harry reid  the democratic leader in the u s  senate  expressed opposition to the commission u2019s ruling  62][64  on february 8  2016  during a commission hearing  three individuals with guns attempted to enter the hearing  security guards turned them back  the individuals said they would return to the next commission hearing and would be armed  65   on december 22  2016  the nevada public utilities commission unanimously decided to eliminate the previous rate structure that went into effect in 2015  which contributed to the collapse of nevada u2019s rooftop solar industry  the decision allows the state u2019s solar market to be restored  the ruling determined that the rate would decrease from 11 cents per kilowatt-hour to 2.6 cents  while the monthly service fee increase from $12.75 to $38.51.[66   recently  it has become a popular trend for utilities in several states to dramatically increase their consumers  fixed charges in order to account for the cost-shift created by the growing number of net metering customers who do not cover their share of grid upkeep costs  which  subsequently  places the burden onto non-solar panel customers  the average increase of fixed charges is estimated at 20 percent   in ohio  american electric power  aep  proposed to more than double its fixed charges from $8.40 per month to $18.40 per month  affecting nearly 1.5 million customers in order to accommodate for the increase costs due to net metering  67   aep was under investigation by the public utilities commission of ohio  puco  for allegedly double-charging their customers a total of $120 million to supposedly cover fuel costs for one of their power plants in lawerenceburg  indiana and for two other power plants operated by ohio valley electric corp  68  the double-charge would have affected 67 percent or 1 million customers who had opted out of an alternate supplier  in 2014  puco enlisted an outside firm to conduct an audit focusing on their consumers  charges  the findings concluded that the customers were indeed overpaying  at the same time  aep was being reimbursed for their fuel costs twice in a period from 2013-2015   the office of the ohio consumer s council  under the auditor s advice  requested aep to disclose additional records  which was  in turn  denied by a puco administrative law judge  who agreed with aep s stance that their confidentiality be protected until the audit process was resolved  68  pablo vegas  the president and chief operating officer of aep ohio  insisted at the time that rates are based on actual costs of system operations  solidifying the company s claim that no deceptive action had taken place  68   in maine  solar companies and major utility companies came to a legislative agreement in 2016 over net metering issues  the two sides said that their deal might increase solar power in maine  tenfold in five years   69  in response  several national solar companies paid for lobbyists to travel to maine and attempt to persuade state legislators to stop the deal  the legislation would replace net metering with a concept referred to as  next metering   under next metering  regulators would set the rates that utilities pay residential solar customers for the customers  excess energy   under normal net metering  utilities would pay the wholesale rate   the legislation includes a grandfather clause for existing solar customers  69   maine is considering changing its net metering energy billing rules  on september 13  2016  the maine public utilities commission proposed a new rule  and then held a public hearing on october 17  the proposal would consider changing net metering billing rules and is expected to be completed in early 2017.[70   in the spring of 2016  the city of mt  vernon  missouri created a local net metering program  the local board of aldermen passed a measure on may 16  2016 that allows for residents and businesses to apply to  generate their own electricity while staying connected to the mt  vernon power grid   71  the board took up the issue after city residents asked about regulations regarding hooking up their own solar panels  the town u2019s program would allow net metering  but consumers must pay for their own equipment including a bi-directional meter  participants would pay for power from the city at the regular rate that any other city consumer would pay  participants who create excess power would receive a credit on their utility bill  equal to what the city pays for the electricity at a wholesale rate from the distributor empire  71   the state of utah offers tax credit for customers of residential solar panels  in february 2017  there was a compromise in the state legislature to phase out the solar tax credit by the year 2021 by limiting how much of a tax credit each person can get  the bill  hb 23  passed out of a state house of representatives committee and is headed to debate on the floor of the house  72   tax credits currently cost the state of utah $6 million per year  this is due to the growth in residential installations  rooftop solar customers can currently get $2,000 in tax credits on their state income tax return  if the bill is passed into law  that amount will be reduced by $400 per year starting in 2018  the solar power industry doesn t like the bill  however  they did not contest it  72   the largest threat to solar power in utah is rate design and changes to net metering  net metering changes are currently under negotiations between solar stakeholders and rocky mountain power  a utility company  72   indian states of tamil nadu  karnataka  and andhra pradesh have started implementation of net metering  and the policy has been announced by the respective state electricity boards in 2014  feasibility study will be done by the electricity boards  and after inspection the meters will be replaced by bidirectional ones and will be installed  applications are taken up for up to 30  of the distribution transformer capacity on a first-come  first-served basis and technical feasibility  73   net purchase and sale is a different method of providing power to the electricity grid that does not offer the price symmetry of net metering  making this system a lot less profitable for home users of small renewable electricity systems   under this arrangement  two uni-directional meters are installed u2014one records electricity drawn from the grid  and the other records excess electricity generated and fed back into the grid  the user pays retail rate for the electricity they use  and the power provider purchases their excess generation at its avoided cost  wholesale rate   there may be a significant difference between the retail rate the user pays and the power provider s avoided cost  74   germany  spain  ontario  canada   some states in the usa  and other countries  on the other hand  have adopted a price schedule  or feed-in tariff  fit   whereby customers get paid for any electricity they generate from renewable energy on their premises  the actual electricity being generated is counted on a separate meter  not just the surplus they feed back to the grid  in germany  for the solar power generated  a feed-in tariff is being paid in order to boost solar power  figure from 2009   germany once paid several times the retail rate for solar but has successfully reduced the rates drastically while actual installation of solar has grown exponentially at the same time due to installed cost reductions  wind energy  in contrast  only receives around a half of the domestic retail rate  because the german system pays what each source costs  including a reasonable profit margin    sources that produce direct current  such as solar panels must be coupled with an electrical inverter to convert the output to alternating current  for use with conventional appliances  the phase of the outgoing power must be synchronized with the grid  and a mechanism must be included to disconnect the feed in the event of grid failure  this is for safety xa0\u2013 for example  workers
