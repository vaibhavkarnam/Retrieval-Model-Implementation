 renewable energy in portugal was the source for 25.7  of energy consumption in 2013  [1  in 2014  63  of portugal s electricity needs were supplied by renewable sources  [2  in 2016  58%[3  of power produced in portugal came from renewable sources  an increase against the previous year (50.4    while renewable energy consumption represented 27.2   early data  of total consumption  4   in 2001  the portuguese government launched a new energy policy instrument \u2013 the e4 programme  energy efficiency and endogenous energies   consisting of a set of multiple  diversified measures aimed at promoting a consistent  integrated approach to energy supply and demand  by promoting energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy  endogenous  sources  the programme sought to upgrade the competitiveness of the portuguese economy and to modernize the country u2019s social fabric  while preserving the environment by reducing gas emissions  especially the carbon dioxide  5   while from 2002-2007 the main priorities were focused on the introduction of natural gas  aiming at progressively replacing oil and coal in the energy balance  and liberalization of the energy market  by opening this former state-owned sector to competition and private investment   the emphasis shifted for the next 5 years was on energy efficiency  supply and demand sides  and use of endogenous  renewable  energy  5   during february 2016  an equivalent to 95  of electricity consumed in portugal was produced by renewable sources such as biomass  hydropower  wind power and solar power  a total of 4139 gwh was produced by these sources  6  in may 2016  all of portugal s electricity was produced renewably for a period of over four days  a landmark achievement for a modern european country  7       the largest hydroelectric power station is at the alto lindoso dam  with a capacity of 630 mw  portugal has about 100 small hydro systems  with a capacity of 256 mw  which produce 815 gwh year  8   from march 2007 to december 2010  wind power nameplate capacity grew from 1,874 to 3,937 mw in  excluding madeira and azores  portugal  the major wind turbine manufacturers in the portuguese market are enercon  vestas and gamesa  9   the 240 mw alto minho wind farm in the viana do castelo district became fully operational in november  2008.[10  at the time of completion it was europe s largest on-shore wind farm  11   other major wind farms which are operating  or under construction  include  arada-montemuro wind farm (112 mw   gardunha wind farm (106 mw   pinhal interior wind farm (144 mw  and ventominho wind farm (240 mw    portugal combines wind and hydropower by using nighttime winds to pump water uphill and sending the water back through generators to produce power the next day  the so-called pumped-storage hydroelectricity  12   a large photovoltaic power project  the serpa solar power plant  was completed in portugal  one of europe s sunniest areas  13  the 11 megawatt plant covered 150 acres (0.61\xa0km2  and employs 52,000 pv panels  the panels are raised 2 metres off the ground allowing grazing to continue  the plant provides enough energy for 8,000 homes and saves an estimated 30,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year  14][15   not far from there  moura photovoltaic power station is under construction  with more than 376,000 solar modules  it will have an installed capacity of 62mwp when finished  the first stage of construction is scheduled for completion in 2008  a solar panel factory is also being built in the city of moura  where there are plans to build a research lab  citation needed   portugal s main investment for the use of this type of energy is in the azores  small scale use of this energy source began in the 1980s in chaves and s  pedro do sul  continental portugal providing 3 mwt   in the azores the use of geothermal energy is widespread  with production in 8 of the 9 islands  collectively producing some 235.5 mwt  in 2003  25  of the electricity consumed in s xe3o miguel was produced by geothermal energy  1   agu xe7adoura wave farm was the world s first commercial wave farm when it opened on 23 september 2008  it was located three miles (5\xa0km  offshore near p xf3voa de varzim north of porto  the farm used three pelamis wave energy converters to convert the motion of the ocean surface waves into electricity  16][17  the wave farm was shut down in november 2008  just over two months after the official opening  18][19   in 2011  portugal produced 45 ktoe  kiloton of oil equivalent  of biogas  20
