 wind farm   transmission assets   the london array is a 175 turbine 630\xa0mw round 2 offshore wind farm located 20\xa0km off the kent coast in the outer thames estuary in the united kingdom  it is the largest offshore wind farm in the world  and the largest wind farm in europe by megawatt capacity   construction of phase 1 of the wind farm began in march 2011 and was completed by mid 2013  being formally inaugurated by the prime minister of the united kingdom  david cameron on 4 july 2013   the second phase of the project was refused planning consent in 2014 due to concerns on the impact to sea birds       the wind farm site is more than 20 kilometres (12\xa0mi  off the north foreland on the kent coast in the area between long sand and kentish knock  between margate in kent and clacton in essex  3  the site has water depths of no more than 25\xa0m 1  and is mostly away from shipping lanes  4   the first phase consisted of 175 siemens wind power swt-3.6 turbines and two offshore substations  giving a wind farm with a peak rated power of 630\xa0mw  5  each turbine and offshore substation is erected on a monopile foundation  and connected together by 210\xa0km (130\xa0mi  of 33\xa0kv array cables  the two offshore substations are connected to an onshore substation at cleve hill  near graveney  on the north kent coast  by four 150\xa0kv subsea export cables  in total 220\xa0km (140\xa0mi   5  it is named after london because the power goes to the london grid  6   the smaller thanet wind farm is to the south of it   the array is intended to reduce annual co2 emissions by about 900,000 tons  equal to the emissions of 300,000 passenger cars  7   in 2001 environmental studies identified areas of the outer thames estuary as potential sites for offshore wind farm  8  the department of trade and industry published the paper future offshore \u2014 a strategic framework for the offshore wind industry  which identified the outer thames estuary as one of three potential areas for future wind farm development  round 2 wind farms   9  the crown estate awarded a 50-year lease to london array ltd   a consortium of e on uk renewables  shell windenergy  and core limited  note 1   in december 2003.[8][12  a planning application was submitted in 2005,[12][13  which was approved in december 2006.[14  planning permission for the onshore electricity substation was received in november 2007.[11   in may 2008  shell announced that it was pulling out of the project  15  it was announced in july 2008 that e on uk and dong energy would buy shell s stake  16  subsequently on 16 october 2008  london array announced the abu dhabi based masdar would join e on as a joint venture party in the scheme  under the agreement  masdar purchased 40  of e on s half share of the scheme  giving masdar a 20  stake in the project overall  17][18  the resultant ownership was 50  dong energy  30  e on uk renewables and 20  masdar  19   in march 2009  the backers agreed on an initial investment of \u20ac2.2\xa0billion  20  financing of phase 1 was achieved through the european investment bank and the danish export credit fund with \xa3250 million  19   in 2013  in response to ofgem  offshore transmission owner  regulations  the consortium divested the electrical transmission assets of the wind farm  valued at \xa3459 million  to  blue transmission london array limited  \u2013 an entity incorporated by barclays infrastructure funds management limited  barclays  and diamond uk transmission corporation  mitsubishi corporation subsidiary   21   in january 2014 dong sold half its stake to quebec public pension plan manager caisse de d xe9p xf4t et placement du qu xe9bec   la caisse    22   at the time of its construction it was the largest offshore wind farm in the world  23   offshore work began in march 2011;[24  the first foundation was installed in march 2011[25   turbines were supplied by siemens wind power  26  their foundations were built by the joint-venture between per aarsleff and bilfinger berger ingenieurbau gmbh  the same company supplied and installed the monopiles  27  generators were installed by mpi and a2sea by using an installation vessel tiv xa0mpi adventure and a jack-up barge sea worker  28  two offshore substations were designed  fabricated and installed by future energy  a joint venture between fabricom  iemants and geosea  while electrical systems and onshore substation work was undertaken by siemens transmission  amp  distribution  the subsea export cable was supplied by nexans and array cables by jdr cable systems  the array cables and the export cables were installed by vsmc  27   the wind farm started producing electricity at the end of october 2012.[24  all 175 turbines of phase 1 were confirmed fully operational on 8 april 2013,[29  and the wind farm was formally inaugurated by the prime minister david cameron on 4 july 2013.[30  in december 2015 it produced 369 gwh  a monthly capacity factor of 78.9   it produced 2.5 twh in 2015  during two days of january 2016  production varied from 3 mw to 619 mw  31][32   a second phase was planned which would have seen a further 166 turbines installed to increase the capacity to 1000\xa0mw  33  however  the second phase was scaled back and finally cancelled in february 2014 after concerns were raised by the royal society for the protection of birds about its effect on a local population of red-throated divers  33][34
