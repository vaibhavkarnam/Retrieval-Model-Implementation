RenewableenergyinCostaRica
 renewable energy in costa rica supplied about 98,1  of the energy output for the entire nation in 2016.[1  in 2014  99  of its electrical energy was derived from renewable energy sources  about 80  of which from hydroelectric power  2  for the first 75 days of 2015  100  of its electrical energy was derived from renewable energy sources 3  and in mid 2016 that feat was accomplished for 110 consecutive days despite suboptimal weather conditions  4  as a country  costa rica has a geographic advantage over others in that its high concentration per capita of rivers  dams  and volcanoes allow for a high renewable energy output  in addition  costa rica is the fourth highest nation in terms of rainfall per capita  it receives an average of 2,926mm of precipitation per year  5  as a smaller nation with a population of only 5 million and no major industry  the need for strong energy infrastructure is less than for larger countries of higher population density  the 1948 elimination of the military of costa rica freed up millions of dollars from the government defense budget which are now invested in social programs and renewable energy generation  1  as president of costa rica in 1948  jos xe9 figueres announced that the nation s former military budget would be refocused specifically in healthcare  education  and environmental protection  6   while costa rica s largest source of energy is hydroelectricity  other sources include geothermal energy  biomass  solar power  and wind power  2       the commercial consumption of energy in costa rica has tripled from 1980 to 2009  the electricity consumption has increased by 4.2 times due to a high level of electrification  7  according with the world bank  99.5%[8  of the country u2019s population has access to electricity  meanwhile  fossil fuel u2019s consumption has increased by 2.4 times  caused by a significant growth of the number of vehicles   the average yearly growing of hydrocarbons consumption in the last 20 years has been about 4.7  and electricity of 5.3   at this rate  demand of electricity will double in 13 years and hydrocarbons in 15 years  the dependency of costa rica for fossil fuels reached in 2009 the 64  of commercial energy while electricity 22   the rest of the basket consumption is completed by biomass (12   and other energy products (2    according with the world bank  as of 2013  the energy use per capita of costa rica was 1029\xa0kg 9  of oil equivalent and the electric power consumption per capita 1955 kwh  10   costa rica receives about 65%[11  of its energy from hydroelectric plants alone due to its extreme amounts of rainfall and multiple rivers  12  as the largest source of energy  hydropower represents the most important source of energy in the country  but after inauguration of the reventazon dam  the only big hydro project remaining in the planning stage by the instituto costarricense de electricidad  costa rican institute of electricity  is the el diqu xeds hydroelectric project  which has been suffering significant delays 13  due to pending environmental studies and the indigenous consultation that the state-owned company should conduct in the framework of the united nations procedures   costa rica u2019s largest dams include the lake arenal dam  lake cachi dam  the rio macho dam  the pirris dam  the reventaz xf3n dam and the proposed el diqu xeds hydroelectric project  the lake arenal dam was built in 1979 as the first dam intended solely for hydroelectric power usage  it is located on lake arenal next to the famous arenal volcano  one of the major tourist attractions in costa rica  at about 33 square miles  lake arenal provides enough electricity to power 12  of the country  14  the lake cachi  rio macho  and pirris dams are all powered by the rio reventaz xf3n (reventaz xf3n river  and its tributaries   the cachi dam is situated on an artificial lake that was built in the 1970s and produces enough energy to power about 330,000 homes in costa rica  it also controls floods and provides recreational activities in the lake  upstream of cachi  the rio macho hydroelectric power plant has been operating since 1963 to provide hydroelectric power for central costa rica  15  on the downstream  the pirris dam is one of the largest dams in costa rica and has the potential to power 160,000 homes  it also employes 3,000 costa ricans and provides drinking water to 40  of the metropolitan city area  the el diqu xeds hydroelectric project is a proposed hydroelectric system that costa rica plans to build as one of the largest central american hydroelectric plant  located in the southern pacific area of the country and is intended to provide the nation with 631mw  enough energy to reach at least one million consumers  the recently opened reventaz xf3n dam  the current largest hydroelectric project of central america is located on the reventaz xf3n river  with a generation contribution of 305.5mw to the national electric system  enough for providing electricity to more than 500,000 families  16][17   geothermal power is a natural energy source that provides subterranean heat and power as a byproduct of volcanic energy  costa rica has six currently active volcanoes and dozens of inactive volcanoes  18  unlike many other forms of renewable energy  geothermal can be continuously generated and is not dependent on weather  geothermal energy contributes to about 15  of the energy in the country  19   the north volcanic mountain ridge in guanacaste is the region of costa rica with the most potential for geothermal power generation  volcanoes in the region include miravalles  rinc xf3n de la vieja  and tenorio   the miravalles geothermal field  opened in 1994  contains five plants and results in the production of 14  of the national electric system s power capacity  or about 163 mw  20  the pailas geothermal power plant  established in july 2011  produces a total of 55mw 21  and is located just outside rinc xf3n de la vieja national park  rinc xf3n de la vieja is a 600,000 year old volcano and the largest in the northwestern region of costa rica  in 2014  costa rica s government approved legislation for a $958 million geothermal project in the region to offset the country s reliance on hydropower  22   while costa rica is not known specifically for its wind power  there have been a few different wind energy projects developed in the past decade  in march 2015  the costa rican institute of electricity stated that they plan on doubling the installed wind capacity in the nation by 2017.[23  as of 2011  only 2.1  of energy produced in the nation came from wind power  24   wind power is primarily used in costa rica during the months of december to march  or the dry season  during this period  there is a general decreased rainfall in the nation and hydropower output decreases   costa rica finished 2015 with an additional 59 mw of power generation in wind energy  after the inauguration of the orosi plant (50 mw  in october and \u201cvientos del oeste u201d project (9 mw   as such  the wind power total capacity in the country is planned to grow from 194 mw in 2015 to 393 mw by 2017  an increase that would represent approximately 10,5  of total electricity production  25   between 1996 and 1999 the first three private wind power plants began operation and in 2002 tejona plant  built by the instituto costarricense de electricidad  later  the following plants were opened  guanacaste  private 2009   los santos  built by the public cooperative coopesantos in 2011 in the heart of \u201clos santos u201d region  in san jos xe9   the \u201cvalle central u201d  built by the compa xf1 xeda nacional de fuerza y luz  or cnfl  a grupo ice subsidiary in 2011  and \u201cchiripa u201d  private  2015    in addition  the construction of five private plants during 2016  altamira  campos azules  mogote  vientos de la perla y vientos de miramar is planned  as well as another by the compa xf1 xeda nacional de fuerza y luz in 2017  ventus project    currently  there are nine large wind farms operating in costa rica  the tejona wind power project  twpp  is a 19.8 mw project  fully operational since 2003  that consists of thirty wind turbines  most recently  tila wind  an even larger 20-mw farm  opened in 2015  three of the remaining eight are owned by ice and compania nacional de fuerza y luz sa  cnfl  and coopesantos rl  the remaining five are privately owned  and nearly all of the wind power plants are in the province of guanacaste  23   like wind power  solar power is another newer energy source in the country  the first solar power projects in the country were established in 1978 by just a few researchers from public universities at the solar power laboratory at the national university  though still on a smaller scale and mostly privately owned  plans for larger more commercial projects are beginning to break through  26   despite the country has a privileged position near the equator that  combined with the sunny weather during the year  made a solar power potential of more than 144 million mwh year  27  solar energy in costa rica is in its early stages  and is even falling shorter than the rest of its central american neighbors  according with a instituto costarricense de electricidad  ice  study in 2006  the national photovoltaic potential of electric generation for the projected population for 2015 is 222,000 mwh year  28   in 2012  costa rica inaugurated the miravalles solar plant on the hillside of the miravalles volcano  at that time  it was the first of its kind in costa rica and the largest solar project in central america  29  it was built with the help of the japanese international cooperation agency  jica   the project u2019s totaling was $11.5 million ($10 million from jica and $1.5 million from ice 30    this plant of 1mw only represents 0.03  of all the capacity installed in the country of 2872 mw   in 2013  china and costa rica signed agreements of usd $30 million for financing the installation of 50 thousand solar panels  including a power plant of 10 mw  31  in addition  in 2014  ice announced a pilot program for solar energy use in housing that aimed to reach 600,000 clients  32  but in 2015  the institution ended the plan arguing that the maximum capacity was already reached  rising criticism from the solar energy distributed generation sector  according with acesolar  33  more than 1000 jobs were at risk for such a decision   differences of bureaucracy procedures and technical aspects related to the official national norm \u201cplaneaci xf3n  operaci xf3n y acceso al sistema el xe9ctrico nacional u201d  poasen  in spanish  on introducing distributed generation have been occurring and causing delays 34][35  in its implementation through the last years among the main actors of the solar sector  the ministry of environment and energy  minae   the autoridad reguladora de servicios p xfablicos  aresep  in spanish  a public entity that fixes prices and standards on public services   the electricity agencies of the country and the private companies that supply solar panels  one of the main discrepancies between minae and aresep was the legal nature of net metering  being solved by the attorney general of the republic  procuradur xeda general de la rep xfablica  in spanish  in june 2015.[36  the final resolution stated that distributed generation for self-consumption is not considered a public service in costa rica  in october 2015  the government finally published 37  the required regulatory framework that entered into operation in april 2016   by 2015  countries like guatemala or honduras have 85 mw and 388 mw of solar power capacity installed respectively  and nicaragua and panama are also ahead of costa rica with 1.4 mw and 42.7 mw  according with a report 38  released in july 2016 by the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean  cepal  in spanish   ice s position is that the maximum capacity that could be allowed in the national electric system is 60 mw  distributed in plants of no more than 5 mw across the territory  39  however  the institution is not reporting to develop more solar projects in the next 10 years in their expansion plan   as of 2011  only .25  of energy produced in costa rica came from biomass  the jorge manuel dengo obregon national development plan proposes the development of sustainable biomass for energy  currently  biomass is primarily used for cooking and heating kitchen appliances to reduce the reliance on petroleum in the household  24   the ministry of environment and energy of costa rica  minae  in english   is the governmental institution responsible of the management of the resources of costa rica in the environmental and energy field  the president of costa rica  luis guillermo solis rivera  appointed 40  engineer irene ca xf1az d xedaz \u2013 a former consultant of the deutsche gesellschaft f xfcr internationale zusammenarbeit - as vice-minister of energy in may 2014  according with the ministry u2019s goals  the energy agenda of costa rica aims to generate a more rational and efficient use of energy resources  reduce the dependency to international markets and prepare the country to face climate change and oil depletion  41  the viceministry of energy has three general departments  sectoral energy  hydrocarbons and transportation and fuels marketing   the sectoral energy department (direcci xf3n sectorial de energ xeda  or dse in spanish  is responsible to create and promote the integral energy planning  using policies and strategic actions for guaranteeing the supply and quality of energy of costa rica  among the objectives of the dse  they are responsible 42  of creating the national energy plan taking into account the national development plan of costa rica  as well as the demands of the ministry of environment and energy   the costa rican institute of electricity  instituto costarricense de electricidad  ice  in spanish  was created on april 8  1949[43  as an autonomous state-owned institution  as a way to solve the issues of electric energy availability that the country was faced during the 40\u2019s  since then  the ice has been executing the electrical development of costa rica  in the last years  the institution has evolved as a corporation  grupo ice  clustering other public companies that include \u201cradiogr xe1fica costarricense u201d  racsa  and the national company of power and illumination (compa xf1 xeda nacional de fuerza y luz  cnfl    \u201cgrupo ice u201d has used as primary source the hydroelectricity for developing its infrastructure  but it has also built  and is currently building  several geothermal  wind and solar energy projects  it has more than 15,000[44  workers and has customer service offices in the whole country  although the first large-scale hydroelectric station began to function at the beginning of the 1900s  large-scale hydroelectric power and electricity did not begin to be developed until the formation of grupo ice  45   the costa rican petroleum refinery  refinadora costarricense de petr xf3leo  recope in spanish  is a state-owned institution  considered the biggest company in central america  since its creation in 1963  and nationalized in 1974   recope focuses its operations on import and distribution of fossil fuels in costa rica  46   in the research field  recope has an experimental plant of biodiesel and through internships and agreements  works with public universities of costa rica and research centers in the developing of alternative fuels like biofuels  natural gas and hydrogen   in 2011  the board of directors of recope signed a partnership with ad astra rocket company  an american rocket propulsion company with facilities in costa rica  for jointly research in hydrogen technologies for the transport sector  47   the project comprehends three phases  phase a  focused in the development of a feasibility study and to generate capacities for designing a station of compression and storage of hydrogen  delivered in 2012   phase b  designing and implementation of the storage system  delivered in 2013  and phase c  development of the integrated and autonomous system of energy supply from hydrogen    the research work has been stranded since 2014  when the new administration of recope decided to not continue with the initiative arguing doubts about the legal authority of recope to invest in clean energy  in march 2015  the ceo of ad astra rocket company and former costa rican-american astronaut  dr  franklin chang diaz  announced the end of relations 48  with recope due their lack of definition and the delays the project was suffering  the announcement was followed by harsh criticism of the population and national media against recope u2019s board of directors as well as other governmental institutions involved in the decision  49][50   asociaci xf3n costarricense de productores de energ xeda  acope  was founded in 1989 and represents more than 40 private hydroelectric  wind  and biomass units generating in the country  though there are a few large private energy companies in costa rica  most primarily generate power to sell to ice   consorcio nacional de empresas de electrificacion de costa rica  conelectricas   formed in 1989  is a union that aims to develop hydroelectric projects  the union consists of four smaller agencies  coopeguanacaste  r l  coope alfaro ruiz  r l  coopelesca  r l  and coopesantos  r l  together  these four cooperatives provide electricity to around 500,000 people  or 22  of the country  24   the asociaci xf3n costarricense de energ xeda solar  acesolar  in spanish  51  is a ngo which its main objective is to promote the use and development of solar energy in the country  the organization collaborate with the private and public representatives related to the sector   at the start of january 2015  costa rica u2019s 4.9 million person population ran entirely on renewable energy power for 75 days straight  this was a record-breaking achievement in that costa rica was the first nation to power itself completely clean of fossil fuels for this long a timeframe  this summer was an exceptionally rainy one for costa rica  while usually the dry season  the sheer amount of power provided from an unusually high amount of precipitation led to a higher than usual amount of hydroelectricity generated  12   in 2007  the administration of former president of costa rica oscar arias s xe1nchez announced the national goal to become costa rica the first carbon neutral country in the world by 2021  the same year when the country will celebrate 200 years of independence from spain  the proposal was officially presented to the united nations framework for climate change convention  unfccc  in 2010  the initiative has been kept 52  by the next administrations of president laura chinchilla miranda and luis guillermo sol xeds rivera and aims to evolve the national economy u2019s carbon footprint to no more than 1 ton of co2 emissions per capita   costa rica aims to be 100  carbon neutral by 2021.[45  apart from relying 99  on renewable resources  carbon neutrality is achieved by adopting electric and hybrid transportation  53  in addition  the costa rican government is also beginning to offset the country s carbon dioxide emissions with new budgeting  laws  and incentives  including measures to promote biofuels  hybrid vehicles  and clean energy  another way of offsetting emissions will be a  c-neutral  tax which will certify that ecotourism and other industrial practices are offsetting their carbon emissions  at $10 per one ton of carbon  the money will fund conservation  reforestation  and research  54   the proposal requires to substitute the use of fossil fuels in the country and the transformation of the transport subsector \u2013 which represents 66  of national hydrocarbons consumption and 54%[55  of the total co2 emissions \u2013 into clean technologies such as electric vehicles  biofuels  hybrid cars and hydrogen vehicles  as well as the promotion among the population to use more the public transport system  41  of the total co2 emissions in the transport subsector comes from particular vehicles  according with the government  these measures could allow the country to save between usd $1.5 and usd $2 billion dollars per year  56  in order to achieve the goal  costa rica also needs to improve its waste management practices and agriculture methods that represents significant proportions of the national ghg emissions   in the last years  the private sector has been actively involved adopting energy efficiency policies and developing low carbon certifications  the national institute of technical norms of costa rica  inteco  in spanish  published the regulations that private companies should follow to get carbon neutral certified   the energy policy of the current administration is guided by the concept of energy sustainability with low emissions  the \u201cvii plan nacional de energ xeda 2015-2030\u201d 57  was designed according the priorities of the national development plan 2015-2018 and the government plan of president luis guillermo sol xeds rivera   the plan is based in five main objectives that are  1  introducing changes in the national power system for increasing energy efficiency  savings and improve the management of electricity demand  2  encouraging the development of distributed generation and self-consumption electricity  3  to update the law and institutional framework specialized in promoting energy efficiency  4  to improve the calculation methods of electricity tariffs and 5  to raise the management efficiency of public entities of the electricity sector   regarding the transport sector  the national energy plan is also including as its main goals to promote \u201ccleaner systems and clients of collective transport for hence mitigate the effects of global warming as well as encouraging the use of alternative fuels in the transport system  reducing the dependency of hydrocarbons  the emission of polluting gases and improve the regulations for importing new and used vehicles in order to promote energy efficiency and polluting reduction u201d   in addition  the national development plan of costa rica 2015-2018[58  establish the sectoral objectives for the energy policy  1  \u201cto promote actions facing global climate change through citizens u2019 participation  technological change  innovation processes  research and knowledge for ensuring the welfare  human security and

efficient use of energy for keeping and improve the competitiveness of the country u201d   utility private scale projects 59  are regulated by the law 7200[60  (\u201cley que autoriza la generaci xf3n el xe9ctrica aut xf3noma o paralela u201d  in spanish   approved by the legislative assembly of costa rica in 1990  the private sector provides to instituto costarricense de electricidad  ice  nearly a quarter of the electricity generation capacity available and 10  of generated  however  there u2019s still debate about how much private participation should be in the market   by 2013  approximately 14.5  of the total generation in the country was provided by private companies and 23  of installed capacity in the national power system  according with ice  61  the law 7200 establishes that ice has two ways to buy private electric generation  in chapter i it is defined the regimen of autonomous or parallel generation  that regulates the boo  build  own and operate  contracts  article 7 of the law states that the \u201cice will be able to declare eligible a project for the use of a plant of limited capacity  meanwhile the power  with the exception of parallel generation  doesn u2019t represent more than 15  of the collective power of electric plants that constitutes the national power system u201d   in chapter ii it is defined the competitive regimen that regulates the bot  build  operate and transfer  contracts  article 20 allows the ice to \u201cbuy electric energy from private companies up to an additional 15  of the limit specified in article 7  this authorization is entitled for acquiring energy from hydro  geothermal  wind and any other non-conventional source  in bundles equal or smaller than 50,000 kw of maximum power  added by law 7508 on may 9  1995)\u201d  by 2014  ice had 25 boo contracts and 9 bot contracts   despite political pressure to increase the participation of private companies and opening the market for reducing the costs of electricity  ice is opposing the idea arguing their expansion plan is already solving the demand for 20 years ahead and the costs of the generation matrix are the lowest  according to ice  62  until 2020 the country will need 850 mw of power generation  and all this demand is already considered with the current on-going projects   although the country has abundant renewable energy resources  more than 25  of costa rican territory has been entitled as natural protected land  reducing and limiting the possibility to explore and exploit these renewable sources  like geothermal energy in national parks  63   in 2016  continuous discussions in the legislative assembly of costa rica have been occurring for a reform that would allow the ice to exploit geothermal energy in protected areas  the project 19.233 was presented by the former candidate to the presidency of the republic and incumbent congress representative  ott xf3n sol xeds from the citizen action party  in turn  the ice would compensate land used for the projects with land outside the parks  the bill addresses concerns over geothermal electricity generation in rinc xf3n de la vieja  tenorio  and arenal volcano national parks  64  this initiative has raising concerns from some activists that claim the environmental controls led in the country by the national technical bureau of environment  secretar xeda t xe9cnica nacional del ambiente  setena in spanish  are weak  the activists also argue the process of exploration for geothermal energy is similar than those used in oil and mining  65   however  in june 2015  the minister of environment and energy  edgar gutierrez espeleta  alleged minae is not currently planning to exploit geothermal energy in national parks and will postpone the decision until further research about its impact in the country and its biodiversity is made  66   the biggest obstacle to carbon neutrality is the transportation sector  vehicles consume 70  of the petroleum consumed in the nation  which is 40  of the total carbon emissions  the primary mode of public transportation is diesel-powered buses  more than 50  of costa rica s personal passenger cars are over 20 years old with high polluting engines  though the government is beginning to propose new hybrid and plug-in electric vehicle initiatives  other proposed solutions include trains  gondolas  and trolleys in the metropolitan costa rican central valley  67   though hydroelectricity from dams is a high-density and high-power energy source  it is also highly dependent on weather conditions  hydropower is reliant on rainfall and is therefore not the most reliable form of energy during seasons of drought  after an extreme season of drought in 2014  costa rica was forced to resort to diesel generators since sufficient rainfall was unavailable to power any of the hydroelectric dams  1   wind and solar are both energy sources that are highly dependent on weather conditions and have therefore been used on a much smaller scale than both hydroelectric and geothermal energy  12   one main barrier to extensive geothermal power is the abundance of national parks and protected areas that prevent excavation near many of costa rican u2019s volcanoes  for example  though rincon de la vieja has the potential to fuel a high density of geothermal energy  costa rican law currently prohibits the extraction of resources inside national parks in order to preserve the land  20  hydroelectric dams have also been criticized for their effects on the surrounding ecosystems  controversy around hydroelectric dam usage stems from both environmental impact on a surrounding region and from human displacement of land  hydroelectric dams have been equated to interference in fish migration patterns  ecosystem disrupt  interference in water quality  and land degradation from flooding the land  68   the pirr xeds dam especially caused much controversy regarding the displacement of people who lived in the area  especially in relation to the indigenous peoples of costa rica  though dams provide job opportunities for locals  they also displace large populations of humans  15   the el diqu xeds hydroelectric project has been one of the most important projects for the instituto costarricense de electricidad  it will be the biggest hydropower dam of the central american region and it u2019s designed to provide stability and reliability to the costa rican electricity generation grid  diqu xeds will produce 655 mw  for a total of 3050 mw per year  its reservoir will extent to an area of approximately 7.407 ha (900 ha of it in indigenous protected lands  and its tunnel of 9 m diameter will have more than 11\xa0km length  the project will require to move seven communities from the area  that is more than a thousand families  the project total expected cost is around usd $2 billion  69   the size of the project and its impact on the local population have raised concerns throughout the years  among the actions deployed by the activists against the project are lawsuits for environmental damages  protests and communications breaks with the government and grupo ice u2019s authorities  70  the diqu xeds u2019s reservoir is projected to flood 10  of the china kich xe1 territory (104 ha  and 8  of t xe9rraba land (726 ha   71   diquis is currently in the pre-investment phase but its impact over culture  environment and life in general for the indigenous made involved the united nations committee on the elimination of racial discrimination  cerd  as a key actor since 2011,[72  after a letter sent by representatives of the indigenous t xe9rraba community  in their notification letter  cerd reminded to costa rica the obligations of consult and participation to all indigenous communities that would be affected by the project  the country replied to the u n  informing the status of the project and highlighting that the construction has not initiated yet   in july 2015  a usd $200 million lawsuit against ice and the government of costa rica set by one of the associations representing the indigenous communities  alleging presumed environmental damage during the preliminary exploration works  was dismissed 73  by a justice court   in october 2016  after a failed meeting with authorities of the government of costa rica led by the vice-minister of the presidency ana gabriel zu xf1iga  a group of indigenous representatives and local leaders confirmed their non-negotiable position against the project  74  the government argued that they are currently working in a decree to facilitate the consultation process that should be released by january 2017   in november 2016  the constitutional court of costa rica declared unconstitutional 75  the article 8 of the presidential decree that establish that the ice is allowed to exploit materials for the dam  the powerhouse and collateral works in the areas where indigenous communities are located
