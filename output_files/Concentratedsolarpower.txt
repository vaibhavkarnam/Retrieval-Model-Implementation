Concentratedsolarpower
 concentrated solar power  also called concentrating solar power  concentrated solar thermal  and csp  systems generate solar power by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight  or solar thermal energy  onto a small area  electricity is generated when the concentrated light is converted to heat  which drives a heat engine  usually a steam turbine  connected to an electrical power generator 1][2][3  or powers a thermochemical reaction  experimental as of 2013[update    4][5][6  heat storage in molten salts allows some solar thermal plants to continue to generate after sunset and adds value to such systems when compared to photovoltaic panels   csp is being commercialized and the csp market saw about 740 megawatt  mw  of generating capacity added between 2007 and the end of 2010  more than half of this  about 478\xa0mw  was installed during 2010  bringing the global total to 1095\xa0mw  spain added 400\xa0mw in 2010  taking the global lead with a total of 632\xa0mw  while the us ended the year with 509\xa0mw after adding 78\xa0mw  including two fossil u2013csp hybrid plants  7  the middle east is also ramping up their plans to install csp based projects  shams-i has been installed in abu dhabi  by masdar  8  the largest csp projects in the world is ivanpah solar power facility in the united states  which uses solar power tower technology  and mojave solar project  which uses parabolic troughs    as of january 2014  spain had a total capacity of 2,300\xa0mw making this country the world leader in csp  united states follows with 1,740\xa0mw  interest is also notable in north africa and the middle east  as well as india and china  in italy  a handful of companies are trying to get authorization for 14 plants  totalling 392\xa0mw  despite a strong local and political opposition  9  the global market has been dominated by parabolic-trough plants  which account for 90  of csp plants  7   in most cases  csp technologies currently cannot compete on price with photovoltaics  solar panels   which have experienced huge growth in recent years due to falling prices of the panels and much smaller operating costs  10  however  the chile copiap xf3 reached \xa26.3/kwh  11  in 2015  csp represented less than 2  of worldwide installed capacity of solar electricity plants   csp is not to be confused with concentrator photovoltaics  cpv   in cpv  the concentrated sunlight is converted directly to electricity via the photovoltaic effect       a legend has it that archimedes used a  burning glass  to concentrate sunlight on the invading roman fleet and repel them from syracuse  in 1973 a greek scientist  dr  ioannis sakkas  curious about whether archimedes could really have destroyed the roman fleet in 212 bc  lined up nearly 60 greek sailors  each holding an oblong mirror tipped to catch the sun s rays and direct them at a tar-covered plywood silhouette 160 feet away  the ship caught fire after a few minutes  however  historians continue to doubt the archimedes story  12   in 1866  auguste mouchout used a parabolic trough to produc u0435 steam for the first solar steam engine  the first patent for a solar collector was obtained by the italian alessandro battaglia in genoa  italy  in 1886  over the following years  inv u0435ntors such as john ericsson and frank shuman developed concentrating solar-powered d u0435vices for irrigation  refrig u0435ration  and locom u043etion  in 1913 shuman finished a 55\xa0hp parabolic solar thermal energy station in maadi  egypt for irrigation  13][14][15][16  the first solar-power system using a mirror dish was built by dr  r h  goddard  who was already well known for his research on liquid-fueled rockets and wrote an article in 1929 in which he asserted that all the previous obstacles had been addressed  17   professor giovanni francia (1911\u20131980  designed and built the first concentrated-solar plant  which entered into operation in sant ilario  near genoa  italy in 1968  this plant had the architecture of today s concentrated-solar plants with a solar receiver in the center of a field of solar collectors  the plant was able to produce 1\xa0mw with superheated steam at 100 bar and 500\xa0\xb0c  18  the 10\xa0mw solar one power tower was developed in southern california in 1981  but the parabolic-trough technology of the nearby solar energy generating systems  segs   begun in 1984  was more workable  the 354\xa0mw segs is still the largest solar power plant in the world  and will remain so until the 390\xa0mw ivanpah power tower project reaches full power   csp is used to produce electricity  sometimes called solar thermoelectricity  usually generated through steam   concentrated-solar technology systems use mirrors or lenses with tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight onto a small area  the concentrated light is then used as heat or as a heat source for a conventional power plant  solar thermoelectricity   the solar concentrators used in csp systems can often also be used to provide industrial process heating or cooling  such as in solar air conditioning   concentrating technologies exist in five common forms  namely parabolic trough  enclosed trough  dish stirlings  concentrating linear fresnel reflector  and solar power tower  19  although simple  these solar concentrators are quite far from the theoretical maximum concentration  20][21  for example  the parabolic-trough concentration gives about \u2153 of the theoretical maximum for the design acceptance angle  that is  for the same overall tolerances for the system  approaching the theoretical maximum may be achieved by using more elaborate concentrators based on nonimaging optics  20][21][22   different types of concentrators produce different peak temperatures and correspondingly varying thermodynamic efficiencies  due to differences in the way that they track the sun and focus light  new innovations in csp technology are leading systems to become more and more cost-effective  23   a parabolic trough consists of a linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector s focal line  the receiver is a tube positioned directly above the middle of the parabolic mirror and filled with a working fluid  the reflector follows the sun during the daylight hours by tracking along a single axis  a working fluid  e g  molten salt 24   is heated to 150\u2013350\xa0\xb0c (300\u2013660\xa0\xb0f  as it flows through the receiver and is then used as a heat source for a power generation system  25  trough systems are the most developed csp technology  the solar energy generating systems  segs  plants in california  the world s first commercial parabolic trough plants  acciona s nevada solar one near boulder city  nevada  and andasol  europe s first commercial parabolic trough plant are representative  along with plataforma solar de almer xeda s ssps-dcs test facilities in spain  26   the design encapsulates the solar thermal system within a greenhouse-like glasshouse  the glasshouse creates a protected environment to withstand the elements that can negatively impact reliability and efficiency of the solar thermal system  27  lightweight curved solar-reflecting mirrors are suspended from the ceiling of the glasshouse by wires  a single-axis tracking system positions the mirrors to retrieve the optimal amount of sunlight  the mirrors concentrate the sunlight and focus it on a network of stationary steel pipes  also suspended from the glasshouse structure  28  water is carried throughout the length of the pipe  which is boiled to generate steam when intense solar radiation is applied  sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up on the mirrors  27   glasspoint solar  the company that created the enclosed trough design  states its technology can produce heat for enhanced oil recovery  eor  for about $5 per million british thermal units in sunny regions  compared to between $10 and $12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies  29   a solar power tower consists of an array of dual-axis tracking reflectors  heliostats  that concentrate sunlight on a central receiver atop a tower  the receiver contains a fluid deposit  which can consist of sea water  the working fluid in the receiver is heated to 500\u20131000\xa0\xb0c (773\u20131,273\xa0k (932\u20131,832\xa0\xb0f   and then used as a heat source for a power generation or energy storage system  25  an advantage of the solar tower is the reflectors can be adjusted instead of the whole tower  power-tower development is less advanced than trough systems  but they offer higher efficiency and better energy storage capability   the solar two in daggett  california and the cesa-1 in plataforma solar de almeria almeria  spain  are the most representative demonstration plants   the planta solar 10 (ps10  in sanlucar la mayor  spain  is the first commercial utility-scale solar power tower in the world   the 377\xa0mw ivanpah solar power facility  located in the mojave desert  is the largest csp facility in the world  and uses three power towers  30  unfortunately  ivanpah generated only 0.652 twh (63   of its energy from solar means  and the other 0.388 twh (37   was generated by burning natural gas  [31][32][33   the national solar thermal test facility  nsttf located in albuquerque  new mexico  is an experimental solar thermal test facility with a heliostat field capable of producing 6\xa0mw  34   fresnel reflectors are made of many thin  flat mirror strips to concentrate sunlight onto tubes through which working fluid is pumped  flat mirrors allow more reflective surface in the same amount of space than a parabolic reflector  thus capturing more of the available sunlight  and they are much cheaper than parabolic reflectors  fresnel reflectors can be used in various size csps  35][36   a dish stirling or dish engine system consists of a stand-alone parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned at the reflector s focal point  the reflector tracks the sun along two axes  the working fluid in the receiver is heated to 250\u2013700\xa0\xb0c (480\u20131,300\xa0\xb0f  and then used by a stirling engine to generate power  25  parabolic-dish systems provide high solar-to-electric efficiency  between 31  and 32    and their modular nature provides scalability  the stirling energy systems  ses   united sun systems  uss  and science applications international corporation  saic  dishes at unlv  and australian national university s big dish in canberra  australia are representative of this technology  a world record for solar to electric efficiency was set at 31.25  by ses dishes at the national solar thermal test facility  nsttf  in new mexico on january 31  2008  a cold  bright day  37  according to its developer  ripasso energy  a swedish firm  in 2015 its dish sterling system being tested in the kalahari desert in south africa showed 34  efficiency  38  the ses installation in maricopa  phoenix was the largest stirling dish power installation in the world until it was sold to united sun systems  subsequently  larger parts of the installation have been moved to china as part of the huge energy demand   heat from the sun can be used to provide steam used to make heavy oil less viscous and easier to pump  solar power tower and parabolic troughs can be used to provide the steam which is used directly so no generators are required and no electricity is produced  solar thermal enhanced oil recovery can extend the life of oilfields with very thick oil which would not otherwise be economical to pump   the commercial deployment of csp plants started by 1984 in the us with the segs plants  the last segs plant was completed in 1990  from 1991 to 2005 no csp plants were built anywhere in the world  global installed csp-capacity has increased nearly tenfold since 2004 and grew at an average of 50 percent per year during the last five years  40]:51 in 2013  worldwide installed capacity increased by 36 percent or nearly 0.9 gigawatt  gw  to more than 3.4\xa0gw  spain and the united states remained the global leaders  while the number of countries with installed csp were growing  there is a notable trend towards developing countries and regions with high solar radiation   csp is also increasingly competing with the cheaper photovoltaic solar power and with concentrator photovoltaics  cpv   a fast-growing technology that just like csp is suited best for regions of high solar insolation  41][42  in addition  a novel solar cpv csp hybrid system has been proposed recently  43   the conversion efficiency \n n n n u03b7 n n n   displaystyle   eta   n n of the incident solar radiation into mechanical work \u2212 without considering the ultimate

percent shortfall in projected production  a pilot 5 megawatt csp power tower  solar one  was converted to a 10 megawatt csp power tower  solar two  decommissioned in 1999  due to the success of solar two  a commercial power plant  called solar tres power tower  was built in spain  renamed gemasolar thermosolar plant  gemasolar s results have paved the way for the crescent dunes project  ivanpah difficulties arise also from not having considered the lessons about the benefits of thermal storage  solana in arizona is at 25 percent below projected numbers  ivanpah in california  is at 40 percent below projected numbers  a slightly bigger photovoltaic power station  like the 290\xa0mw agua caliente solar project peaked at most to 741\xa0gw xb7h in 2014  comparing with the 280\xa0mw solana growing 719\xa0gw xb7h  another operator  that of the 280\xa0mw genesis solar  projected only 580\xa0gw xb7h production and instead made 621\xa0gw xb7h in 2015   csp was once thought to be economically superior to photovoltaics  up to 2015 it has proven not to be the case  recent pv commercial power is selling for \u2153 recent csp contracts  48][49   as of 9 september 2009 update   the cost of building a csp station was typically about us 2.50 to $4 per watt  50  while the fuel  the sun s radiation  is free  thus a 250\xa0mw csp station would have cost $600\u20131000 million to build  that works out to $0.12 to 0.18 usd kwh  50  new csp stations may be economically competitive with fossil fuels  nathaniel bullard  a solar analyst at bloomberg new energy finance  has calculated that the cost of electricity at the ivanpah solar power facility  a project under construction in southern california  will be lower than that from photovoltaic power and about the same as that from natural gas  51  however  in november 2011  google announced that they would not invest further in csp projects due to the rapid price decline of photovoltaics  google invested us 168 million on brightsource  52][53  irena has published on june 2012 a series of studies titled   renewable energy cost analysis   the csp study shows the cost of both building and operation of csp

projects currently accepted are not affected  except that a 6  tax on feed-in-tariffs has been adopted  effectively reducing the feed-in-tariff  58   at the federal level  under the large-scale renewable energy target  lret   in operation under the renewable energy electricity act 2000  large scale solar thermal electricity generation from accredited ret power stations may be entitled to create large-scale generation certificates  lgcs   these certificates can then be sold and transferred to liable entities  usually electricity retailers  to meet their obligations under this tradeable certificates scheme  however  as this legislation is technology neutral in its operation  it tends to favour more established re technologies with a lower levelised cost of generation  such as large scale onshore wind  rather than solar thermal and csp  59  at state level  renewable energy feed-in laws typically are capped by maximum generation capacity in kwp  and are open only to micro or medium scale generation and in a number of instances are only open to solar pv  photovoltaic  generation  this means that larger scale csp projects would not be eligible for payment for feed-in incentives in many of the state and territory jurisdictions   a study done by greenpeace international  the european solar thermal electricity association  and the international energy agency s solarpaces group investigated the potential and future of concentrated solar power  the study found that concentrated solar power could account for up to 25  of the world s energy needs by 2050  the increase in investment would be from 2 billion euros worldwide to 92.5 billion euros in that time period  60  spain is the leader in concentrated solar power technology  with more than 50 government-approved projects in the works  also  it exports its technology  further increasing the technology s stake in energy worldwide  because the technology works best with areas of high insolation  solar radiation   experts predict the biggest growth in places like africa  mexico  and the southwest united states  it indicates that the thermal storage systems based in nitrates  calcium  potassium  sodium      will make the csp plants more and more profitable  the study examined three different outcomes for this technology  no increases in csp technology  investment continuing as it has been in spain and the us  and finally the true potential of csp without any barriers on its growth  the findings of the third part are shown in the table below   finally  the study acknowledged how technology for csp was improving and how this would result in a drastic price decrease by 2050  it predicted a drop from the current range of \u20ac0.23\u20130.15 kwh to \u20ac0.14\u20130.10/kwh  60  recently the eu has begun to look into developing a \u20ac400 billion ($774 billion  network of solar power plants based in the sahara region using csp technology known as desertec  to create  a new carbon-free network linking europe  the middle east and north africa   the plan is backed mainly by german industrialists and predicts production of 15  of europe s power by 2050  morocco is a major partner in desertec and as it has barely 1  of the electricity consumption of the eu  it will produce more than enough energy for the entire country with a large energy surplus to deliver to europe  61   algeria has the biggest area of desert  and private algerian firm cevital has signed up for desertec  61  with its wide desert  the highest csp potential in the mediterranean and middle east regions   about 170 twh year  and its strategic geographical location near europe algeria is one of the key countries to ensure the success of desertec project  moreover  with the abundant natural-gas reserve in the algerian desert  this will strengthen the technical potential of algeria in acquiring solar-gas hybrid power plants for 24-hour electricity generation   other organizations expect csp to cost $0.06 us  kwh by 2015 due to efficiency improvements and mass production of equipment  62  that would make csp as cheap as conventional power  investors such as venture capitalist vinod khosla expect csp to continuously reduce costs and actually be cheaper than coal power after 2015   in 2009  scientists at the national renewable energy laboratory  nrel  and skyfuel teamed to develop large curved sheets of metal that have the potential to be 30  less expensive than today s best collectors of concentrated solar power by replacing glass-based models with a silver polymer sheet that has the same performance as the heavy glass mirrors  but at much lower cost and weight  it also is much easier to deploy and install  the glossy film uses several layers of polymers  with an inner layer of pure silver   telescope designer roger angel  univ  of arizona  has turned his attention to cpv  and is a partner in a company called rehnu  angel utilizes a spherical concentrating lens with large-telescope technologies  but much cheaper materials and mechanisms  to create efficient systems  63   recent experience with csp technology in 2014 - 2015 at solana in arizona  and ivanpah in nevada indicate large production shortfalls in electricity generation between 25 and 40 percent  producers blame clouds and stormy weather  but critics seem to think there are technological issues  these problems are causing utilities to pay inflated prices for wholesale electricity  and threaten the long-term viability of the technology  as photovoltaic costs continue to plummet  many think csp has a limited future in utility-scale electricity production  64   there are several proposals for gigawatt size  very large scale solar power plants  they include the euro-mediterranean desertec proposal and project helios in greece (10 gigawatt   both now canceled  a 2003 study concluded that the world could generate 2,357,840 twh each year from very large scale solar power plants using 1  of each of the world s deserts  total consumption worldwide was 15,223 twh year 65   in 2003   the gigawatt size projects are arrays of single plants  the largest single

killed  burned  if the birds fly near the point where light is being focused  this can also affect raptors who hunt the birds  67][68][69][70  federal wildlife officials have begun calling these power towers  mega traps  for wildlife  71][72][73   according to rigorous reporting  in over six months  actually only 133 singed birds were counted  74  by focusing no more than four mirrors on any one
