Exhaustgas
 exhaust gas or flue gas is emitted as a result of the combustion of fuels such as natural gas  gasoline  petrol  biodiesel blends  1  diesel fuel  fuel oil  or coal  according to the type of engine  it is discharged into the atmosphere through an exhaust pipe  flue gas stack  or propelling nozzle  it often disperses downwind in a pattern called an exhaust plume   it is a major component of motor vehicle emissions  and from stationary internal combustion engines   which can also include   motor vehicle emissions contribute to air pollution and are a major ingredient in the creation of smog in some large cities  a 2013 study by mit indicates that 53,000 early deaths occur per year in the united states alone because of vehicle emissions  2  according to another study from the same university  traffic fumes alone cause the death of 5,000 people every year just in the united kingdom  3       the largest part of most combustion gas is nitrogen (n2   water vapor (h2o   except with pure-carbon fuels   and carbon dioxide (co2   except for fuels without carbon   these are not toxic or noxious  although carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming   a relatively small part of combustion gas is undesirable  noxious  or toxic substances  such as carbon monoxide  co  from incomplete combustion  hydrocarbons  properly indicated as cxhy  but typically shown simply as  hc  on emissions-test slips  from unburnt fuel  nitrogen oxides  nox  from excessive combustion temperatures  and particulate matter  mostly soot    exhaust gas temperature  egt  is important to the functioning of the catalytic converter of an internal combustion engine  it may be measured by an exhaust gas temperature gauge  egt is also a measure of engine health in gas-turbine engines  see below    during the first two minutes after starting the engine of a car that has not been operated for several hours  the amount of emissions can be very high  this occurs for two main reasons   comparable with the european emission standards euro iii as it was applied on october 2000  in 2000  the united states environmental protection agency began to implement more stringent emissions standards for light duty vehicles  the requirements were phased in beginning with 2004 vehicles and all new cars and light trucks were required to meet the updated standards by the end of 2007   in spark-ignition engines the gases resulting from combustion of the fuel and air mix are called exhaust gases  the composition varies from petrol to diesel engines  but is around these levels   the 10  oxygen for  diesel  is likely if the engine was idling  e g  in a test rig  it is much less if the engine is running under load  citation needed   exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine whose fuel includes nitromethane will contain nitric acid vapour  which is corrosive  and when inhaled causes a muscular reaction making it impossible to breathe  people exposed to it should wear a gas mask  8   in jet engines and rocket engines  exhaust from propelling nozzles which in some applications shows shock diamonds  citation needed   in steam engine terminology the exhaust is steam that is now so low in pressure that it can no longer do useful work   mono-nitrogen oxides no and no2  whether produced this way or naturally by lightning  react with ammonia  moisture  and other compounds to form nitric acid vapor and related particles  small particles can penetrate deeply into sensitive lung tissue and damage it  causing premature death in extreme cases  inhalation of such particles may cause or worsen respiratory diseases such as emphysema and bronchitis  it may also aggravate existing heart disease  9][10][11  in a 2005 u s  epa study the largest emissions of nox came from on road motor vehicles  with the second largest contributor being non-road equipment which is mostly gasoline and diesel stations  11   the resulting nitric acid may be washed into soil  where it becomes nitrate  which is useful to growing plants   when oxides of nitrogen  nox  and volatile organic compounds  vocs  react in the presence of sunlight  ground level ozone is formed  a primary ingredient in smog  a 2005 u s  epa report gives road vehicles as the second largest source of vocs in the u s  at 26  and 19  are from non road equipment which is mostly gasoline and diesel stations  12  27  of voc emissions are from solvents which are used in the manufacturer of paints and paint thinners and other uses  13   ozone is beneficial in the upper atmosphere  14  but at ground level ozone irritates the respiratory system  causing coughing  choking  and reduced lung capacity  15  it also has many bad effects throughout the ecosystem  16   carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries  17  carbon monoxide is colorless  odorless and tasteless  but highly toxic  it combines with hemoglobin to produce carboxyhemoglobin  which is ineffective for delivering oxygen to bodily tissues  in 2011  52  of carbon monoxide emissions were created by mobile vehicles in the u s  18   chronic  long-term  exposure to benzene (c6h6  damages bone marrow  it can also cause excessive bleeding and depress the immune system  increasing the chance of infection  benzene causes leukemia and is associated with other blood cancers and pre-cancers of the blood  19][20   the health effects of inhaling airborne particulate matter have been widely studied in humans and animals and include asthma  lung cancer  cardiovascular issues  and premature death  because of the size of the particles  they can penetrate the deepest part of the lungs  21  a 2011 uk study estimates 90 deaths per year due to passenger vehicle pm  22  in a 2006 publication  the u s  federal highway administration  fhwa  state that in 2002 about 1 per-cent of all pm10 and 2 per-cent of all pm2.5 emissions came from the exhaust of on-road motor vehicles  mostly from diesel engines   23   carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas  motor vehicle co2 emissions are part of the anthropogenic contribution to the growth of co2 concentrations in the atmosphere which according to the vast majority of the scientific community is causing climate change  24  motor vehicles are calculated to generate about 20  of the european union s man-made co2 emissions  with passenger cars contributing about 12%.[25  european emission standards limit the co2 emissions of new passenger cars and light vehicles  the european union average new car co2 emissions figure dropped by 5.4  in the year to the first quarter of 2010  down to 145.6 g km  26   vehicle exhaust contains much water vapour   there has been research into ways that troops in deserts can recover drinkable water from their vehicles  exhaust gases  27   emission standards focus on reducing pollutants contained in the exhaust gases from vehicles as well as from industrial flue gas stacks and other air pollution exhaust sources in various large-scale industrial facilities such as petroleum refineries  natural gas processing plants  petrochemical plants and chemical production plants  28][29  however  these are often referred to as flue gases  catalytic converters in cars intend to break down the pollution of exhaust gases using a catalyst  scrubbers in ships intend to remove the sulfur dioxide (so2  of marine exhaust gases  the regulations on marine sulfur dioxide emissions are tightening  however only a small number of special areas worldwide have been designated for low sulfur diesel fuel use only   one of the advantages claimed for advanced steam technology engines is that they produce smaller quantities of toxic pollutants  e g  oxides of nitrogen  than petrol and diesel engines of the same power  citation needed  they produce larger quantities of carbon dioxide but less carbon monoxide due to more efficient combustion   researchers from the university of california  los angeles school of public health say preliminary results of their statistical study of children listed in the california cancer registry born between 1998 and 2007 found that traffic pollution may be associated with a 5  to 15  increase in the likelihood of some cancers  30  a world health organization study found that diesel fumes cause an increase in lung cancer  31   the california air resources board  c a r b   found in studies that 50  or more of the air pollution  smog  in southern california is due to car emissions  citation needed
