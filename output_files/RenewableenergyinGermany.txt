 germany s renewable energy sector is among the most innovative and successful worldwide  needs verification   net-generation from renewable energy sources in the german electricity sector has increased from 6.3  in 2000 to about 34  in 2016.[1   on sunday 15 may 2016 at 14:00 hours  renewables supplied nearly all of domestic electricity demand  2   while peak-generation from combined wind and solar reached a previous all-time high of 74  in april 2014,[3  wind power saw its best day ever on december 12  2014  generating 562 gwh  4  germany has been called  the world s first major renewable energy economy   5][6   more than 23,000 wind turbines and 1.4 million solar pv systems are distributed all over the country s area of 357,000\xa0square kilometers  7][8  as of 2011  germany s federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization  9  with a particular focus on offshore wind farms  10  a major challenge is the development of sufficient network capacities for transmitting the power generated in the north sea to the large industrial consumers in southern parts of the country  11   according to official figures  some 370,000 people were employed in the renewable energy sector in 2010  especially in small and medium-sized companies  this is an increase of around 8  compared to 2009  around 339,500 jobs   and well over twice the number of jobs in 2004 (160,500   about two-thirds of these jobs are attributed to the renewable energy sources act  12][13   germany s energy transition  the energiewende  designates a significant change in energy policy from 2011  the term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation  for example  producing heat and power in very small cogeneration units   which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency       since the passage of the directive on electricity production from renewable energy sources in 1997  germany and the other states of the european union were working towards a target of 12  renewable electricity by 2010  germany passed this target early in 2007  when the renewable energy share in electricity consumption in germany reached 14%.[14  in september 2010  the german government announced ambitious energy targets  15]:5 after the 2013 elections  the new cdu csu and spd coalition government continued the energy transition  with only minor modifications of its targets in the coalition agreement  16  these targets include  for renewable energy   the german government reported  in 2011  renewable energy  mainly wind turbines and biomass plants  generated more than 123\xa0twh of electricity  providing nearly 20  of the 603\xa0twh of electricity supplied  18   in 2012  all renewable energy accounted for 21.9  of electricity  with wind turbines and photovoltaic providing 11.9  of the total  19   chancellor angela merkel  along with a vast majority of her compatriots  believes   as the first big industrialized nation  we can achieve such a transformation toward efficient and renewable energies  with all the opportunities that brings for exports  developing new technologies and jobs   20   as of 2016  renewable sources account for 33.9  of the net electricity production  compared to the same period of 2015  energy production from renewable energy sources remained on the same level  while it increased for gas by 15.1 twh and decreased for the remaining fossil fuels by 16.6 twh  the increase in energy production from gas can be traced back to low gas prices  1]:4,5  as of 2015 germany s primary energy consumption of 13\u2009218 petajoules or 3\u2009672 terawatt-hours refers to the total energy used by the nation  the final renewable energy consumption  split by the sectors  and with their relative share  are  21]:4,5,10  as of the end of 2015  renewable energy sources  such as biomass  biogas  biofuels  hydro  wind and solar  accounted for 12.4  of the country s primary energy consumption  a more than doubling compared to 2004  when renewables only contributed 4.5%.[21]:5  although the terms  energy  and  electricity  are often used interchangeably  they should not be confused with one another  as electricity is only one form of energy and does not account for the energy consumed by combustion engines and heat boilers  used in transportation by vehicles and for the heating of buildings   a travel guide to renewable energy destinations in germany was published in 2016.[22   in 2013  wind power generated a total of 53.4 twh of electricity and more than 3.2 gw of new capacity was added to the grid  24  in 2011  the country s installed capacity of wind power reached 29,075 megawatts  mw   about 8  of the overall capacity  25  according to ewea  in a normal wind year  installed wind capacity in germany will meet 10.6  at end 2011 and 9.3  at end 2010 of the german electricity needs  26][27   more than 21,607 wind turbines are located in the german federal area and the country has plans to build more  28][29  as of 2011  germany s federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization  9  with a particular focus on offshore wind farms  10  a major challenge is the development of sufficient network capacities for transmitting the power generated in the north sea to the large industrial consumers in southern germany  11  in 2016  germany decided to replace feed-in tariffs with auctions from 2017.[30   the key provider of biomass supply in germany is supposed to be agriculture  moreover  40  of german wood production is also used as a biomass feedstock  31  the german federal research centre for forestry and forest products claims that there are also reserves which may assist in enlarging the part of forestry in biomass production  agriculture is the main source of rapeseed oil  which is used for the production of biodiesel and making substrates for the production of biogas  32   biomass used for the production of biogas and biofuels are some of germany s most important sources of renewable energy  in 2010  biomass accounted for 30  of renewable electricity generation and for 70  of all renewable energy  mostly wood   33   germany has committed to blending 6.25  biofuels in petroleum by 2014 with the biofuels quota act  34][35   solar photovoltaic  pv  technology generates electricity from sunlight  and it can be used in grid-connected and off-grid applications  they were first mass-produced in the year 2000  when german environmentalists and eurosolar have succeeded in obtaining the government support for the 100,000 roofs program  37  in july 2012  a cumulative installed total solar pv power of 29.7 gw was in place  38  solar pv provided 18\xa0tw xb7h in 2011  3  of the total electricity demand  as solar power installations rise quickly  in first half of 2012  about 5.3  of the total electricity demand was covered by solar power  39  on saturday may 25  2012  solar power broke a new record high  feeding 22 gw into the power grid  or as much as 20 nuclear power stations  this jump above the 20 gw level was due to increased capacity and excellent weather conditions countrywide  and made up for half of the nation s electricity demand at midday  40  germany was also the biggest expanding market for solar pv 2012  with 7.6 gw of newly connected systems  41  some market analysts expect the solar electricity share could reach 25  by 2050.[42  price of pv systems has decreased more than 50  in 5\xa0years since 2006.[43   the total installed hydroelectic capacity in germany at the end of 2006 was 4.7 gw  hydropower meets 3.5  of the electricity demand  latest estimates show  in germany in 2007  about 9,400 people were employed in the hydropower sector which generated a total turnover of \u20ac1.23 billion  44   geothermal power in germany is expected to grow  mainly because of a law that benefits the production of geothermal electricity and guarantees a feed-in tariff  but after a renewable energy law that introduced a tariff scheme of \u20ac0.15 [us 0.23  per kilowatt-hour  kwh  for electricity produced from geothermal sources came into effect that year  a construction boom was sparked and the new power plants are now starting to come online   germany s renewable energy sector is among the most innovative and successful worldwide  enercon  nordex  repower systems  siemens  and fuhrl xe4nder are wind-power companies based in germany  solarworld  q-cells  and conergy are solar-power companies based in germany  these companies dominate clarification needed  the world market  every third solar panel and every second wind rotor in germany are german  and german turbines and generators used in hydro energy generation are among the most popular worldwide  45   nearly 800,000 people work in the german environment technology sector  an estimated 214,000 people work with renewables in germany  up from 157,000 in 2004  an increase of 36%.[45   siemens chief executive peter l xf6scher believes germany u2019s target of generating 35  of its energy from renewables by 2020 is achievable \u2013 and  most probably  profitable for europe u2019s largest engineering company  its \u201cenvironmental solutions u201d portfolio  which is firmly focused on renewables  is \u201calready generating more than \u20ac27 billion a year  35 per cent of siemens u2019 total revenue  and the plan is to grow this to \u20ac40 billion by 2015\u201d  ending its involvement in nuclear industry will boost the credibility of siemens as a purveyor of \u201cgreen technology u201d  46   germany s main competitors in solar electricity are japan  the us  and china  in the wind industry  it is denmark  spain  and the us   the renewable energy sector benefited when the alliance '90 the greens party joined the federal government between 1998 and 2005  support for renewable energy continued under all following governments  regardless of composition  including the current cdu csu and spd coalition government starting in 2013.[16  the renewable energy sector was aided especially by the renewable energy sources act that promotes renewable energy mainly by stipulating feed-in tariffs and recently also market premiums that grid operators must pay for renewable energy fed into the power grid  people who produce renewable energy can sell their  product  at fixed prices for a period of 20 or 15\xa0years  this has created a surge in the production of renewable energy  47  in 2012  siemens estimated the total cost of renewable energy would come to at least \u20ac1.4\xa0trillion (us 1.8\xa0trillion  by 2030.[48   for the 2011\u20132014 period  the federal government set aside 3.5\xa0billion euros for scientific research in the country  49  additionally  in 2001 a law was passed requiring the closing of all nuclear power plants within a period of 32\xa0years  the shutdown time was extended to 2040 by a new government in 2010  after the fukushima incident  the law was abrogated and the end of nuclear energy was set to 2022.[50  after the 2013 federal elections  the new cdu csu and spd coalition in important areas continued the energiewende of the previous government  but also agreed on a major revision of the eeg  51   the german energy policy is framed within the european union  and the march 2007 european council in brussels approved a mandatory energy plan that requires a 20  reduction of carbon dioxide emissions before the year 2020 and the consumption of renewable energies to be 20  of total eu consumption  compared to 7  in 2006).[52  the accord indirectly acknowledged the role of nuclear energy \u2014 which is not commonly regarded as renewable  but emissions-free \u2014 in the reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases  allowing each member state to decide whether or not to use nuclear-generated electricity  53   also  a compromise was reached to achieve a minimum quota of 10  biofuels in the total consumption of gasoline and diesel in transport in 2020   energiewende   energy transition   designates a significant change in energy policy  the term encompasses a reorientation of policy from demand to supply and a shift from centralized to distributed generation  for example  producing heat and power in very small cogeneration units   which should replace overproduction and avoidable energy consumption with energy-saving measures and increased efficiency   the key policy document outlining the energiewende was published by the german government in september 2010  some six months before the fukushima nuclear accident  15  legislative support was passed in september 2010  important aspects include   to \u221295   in addition  there will be an associated research and development drive   the policy has been embraced by the german federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables  particularly wind power  germany s share of renewables has increased from around 5  in 1999 to 22.9  in 2012  reaching close to the oecd average of 18  usage of renewables  54  producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for 20 years  guaranteeing a fixed income  energy co-operatives have been created  and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits  the large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market  nuclear power plants were closed  and the existing nine plants will close earlier than planned  in 2022   in may 2013  the international energy agency commended germany for its commitment to developing a comprehensive energy transition strategy  ambitious renewable energy goals  and plans to increase efficient energy use and supported this approach  nevertheless  the scale of germany u2019s energy policy ambitions  coupled with the large size and energy intensity of its economy  and its central location in europe u2019s energy system  mean further policy measures must be developed if the country u2019s ambitious energy transition is to maintain a workable balance between sustainability  affordability  and competitiveness  55   subsidies aimed at stimulating the growth of renewables have driven up consumer energy prices by 12.5  in 2013.[56  to date  german consumers have absorbed the costs of the energiewende  but the iea says the debate over the social and economic impacts of the new approach has become more prominent as the share of renewable energy has continued to grow alongside rising electricity prices  the transition to a low-carbon energy sector requires public acceptance  and  therefore  retail electricity prices must remain at an affordable level  presently  german electricity prices are among the highest in europe  despite relatively low wholesale prices  55  at the same time  the iea said the new energy policy is based on long-term investment decisions  and a strong policy consensus in germany in favour of large-scale renewable energy commercialisation exists  55   in germany  almost half of renewable power capacity was citizen-owned as of 2013  and about 20 million germans lived in so-called 100  renewable energy regions  57   estimated german jobs in renewable energy in 2012\u20132013 were about 370,000.[58   increases in installed renewable electric power capacity and generation in recent years is shown in the charts and table below  21   the energiewende has be subject to a number of computer studies  most concentrate on electricity generation and consumption as this sector is undergoing a rapid transition in terms of technologies and institutions
