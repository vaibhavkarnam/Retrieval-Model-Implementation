Humanimpactontheenvironment
 human impact on the environment or anthropogenic impact on the environment includes impacts on biophysical environments  biodiversity  and other resources  1][2  the term anthropogenic designates an effect or object resulting from human activity  the term was first used in the technical sense by russian geologist alexey pavlov  and was first used in english by british ecologist arthur tansley in reference to human influences on climax plant communities  3  the atmospheric scientist paul crutzen introduced the term  anthropocene  in the mid-1970s  4  the term is sometimes used in the context of pollution emissions that are produced as a result of human activities but applies broadly to all major human impacts on the environment  5       the applications of technology often result in unavoidable and unexpected environmental impacts  which according to the i   pat equation is measured as resource use or pollution generated per unit gdp  environmental impacts caused by the application of technology are often perceived as unavoidable for several reasons  first  given that the purpose of many technologies is to exploit  control  or otherwise \u201cimprove u201d upon nature for the perceived benefit of humanity while at the same time the myriad of processes in nature have been optimized and are continually adjusted by evolution  any disturbance of these natural processes by technology is likely to result in negative environmental consequences  6  second  the conservation of mass principle and the first law of thermodynamics  i e   conservation of energy  dictate that whenever material resources or energy are moved around or manipulated by technology  environmental consequences are inescapable  third  according to the second law of thermodynamics  order can be increased within a system  such as the human economy  only by increasing disorder or entropy outside the system  i e   the environment   thus  technologies can create \u201corder u201d in the human economy  i e   order as manifested in buildings  factories  transportation networks  communication systems  etc   only at the expense of increasing \u201cdisorder u201d in the environment  according to a number of studies  increased entropy is likely to be correlated to negative environmental impacts  7][8][9][10   the environmental impact of agriculture varies based on the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world  ultimately  the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers  the connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect  as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature   there are two types of indicators of environmental impact   means-based   which is based on the farmer s production methods  and  effect-based   which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment  an example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater  that is effected by the amount of nitrogen applied to the soil  an indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-based  11   the environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors from the soil  to water  the air  animal and soil diversity  plants  and the food itself  some of the environmental issues that are related to agriculture are climate change  deforestation  genetic engineering  irrigation problems  pollutants  soil degradation  and waste   the environmental impact of fishing can be divided into issues that involve the availability of fish to be caught  such as overfishing  sustainable fisheries  and fisheries management  and issues that involve the impact of fishing on other elements of the environment  such as by-catch and destruction of habitat such as coral reefs  12   these conservation issues are part of marine conservation  and are addressed in fisheries science programs  there is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be caught and humanity u2019s desire to catch them  a problem that gets worse as the world population grows   similar to other environmental issues  there can be conflict between the fishermen who depend on fishing for their livelihoods and fishery scientists who realize that if future fish populations are to be sustainable then some fisheries must reduce or even close  13   the journal science published a four-year study in november 2006  which predicted that  at prevailing trends  the world would run out of wild-caught seafood in 2048  the scientists stated that the decline was a result of overfishing  pollution and other environmental factors that were reducing the population of fisheries at the same time as their ecosystems were being degraded  yet again the analysis has met criticism as being fundamentally flawed  and many fishery management officials  industry representatives and scientists challenge the findings  although the debate continues  many countries  such as tonga  the united states  australia and new zealand  and international management bodies have taken steps to appropriately manage marine resources  14][15   the environmental impact of irrigation includes the changes in quantity and quality of soil and water as a result of irrigation and the ensuing effects on natural and social conditions at the tail-end and downstream of the irrigation scheme   the impacts stem from the changed hydrological conditions owing to the installation and operation of the scheme   an irrigation scheme often draws water from the river and distributes it over the irrigated area  as a hydrological result it is found that   these may be called direct effects   effects on soil and water quality are indirect and complex  and subsequent impacts on natural  ecological and socio-economic conditions are intricate  in some  but not all instances  water logging and soil salinization can result  however  irrigation can also be used  together with soil drainage  to overcome soil salinization by leaching excess salts from the vicinity of the root zone  16][17   irrigation can also be done extracting groundwater by  tube wells  as a hydrological result it is found that the level of the water descends  the effects may be water mining  land soil subsidence  and  along the coast  saltwater intrusion   irrigation projects can have large benefits  but the negative side effects are often overlooked  18][19  agricultural irrigation technologies such as high powered water pumps  dams  and pipelines are responsible for the large-scale depletion of fresh water resources such as aquifers  lakes  and rivers  as a result of this massive diversion of freshwater  lakes  rivers  and creeks are running dry  severely altering or stressing surrounding ecosystems  and contributing to the extinction of many aquatic species  20   lal and stewart estimated global loss of agricultural land by degradation and abandonment at 12 million hectares per year  21  in contrast  according to scherr  glasod  global assessment of human-induced soil degradation  under the un environment programme  estimated that 6 million hectares of agricultural land per year had been lost to soil degradation since the mid-1940s  and she noted that this magnitude is similar to earlier estimates by dudal and by rozanov et al  22  such losses are attributable not only to soil erosion  but also to salinization  loss of nutrients and organic matter  acidification  compaction  water logging and subsidence  23  human-induced land degradation tends to be particularly serious in dry regions  focusing on soil properties  oldeman estimated that about 19 million square kilometers of global land area had been degraded  dregne and chou  who included degradation of vegetation cover as well as soil  estimated about 36 million square kilometers degraded in the world u2019s dry regions  24  despite estimated losses of agricultural land  the amount of arable land used in crop production globally increased by about 9  from 1961 to 2012  and is estimated to have been 1.396 billion hectares in 2012.[25   global average soil erosion rates are thought to be high  and erosion rates on conventional cropland generally exceed estimates of soil production rates  usually by more than an order of magnitude  26  in the us  sampling for erosion estimates by the us nrcs  natural resources conservation service  is statistically based  and estimation uses the universal soil loss equation and wind erosion equation  for 2010  annual average soil loss by sheet  rill and wind erosion on non-federal us land was estimated to be 10.7 t ha on cropland and 1.9 t ha on pasture land  the average soil erosion rate on us cropland had been reduced by about 34  since 1982.[27  no-till and low-till practices have become increasingly common on north american cropland used for production of grains such as wheat and barley  on uncultivated cropland  the recent average total soil loss has been 2.2 t ha per year  27  in comparison with agriculture using conventional cultivation  it has been suggested that  because no-till agriculture produces erosion rates much closer to soil production rates  it could provide a foundation for sustainable agriculture  26   environmental impacts associated with meat production include use of fossil energy  water and land resources  greenhouse gas emissions  and in some instances  rainforest clearing  water pollution and species endangerment  among other adverse effects  28  [29  steinfeld et al  of the fao estimated that 18  of global anthropogenic ghg  greenhouse gas  emissions  estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents  are associated in some way with livestock production  28  a more recent fao analysis estimated that all agriculture  including the livestock sector  in 2011 accounted for 12  of global anthropogenic ghg emissions expressed as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents  30  similarly  the intergovernmental panel on climate change has estimated that about 10 to 12  of global anthropogenic ghg emissions  expressed as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents  were assignable to all of agriculture  including the livestock sector  in 2005[31  and again in 2010.[32  the percentage assignable to livestock would be some fraction of the percentage for agriculture  the amount assignable to meat production would be some fraction of that assigned to livestock  fao data indicate that meat accounted for 26  of global livestock product tonnage in 2011  however  many estimates use different sectoral assignment of some emissions  [25  environmental specialists jeff anhang and robert goodland with the ifc and world bank  have put the ghg associated with livestock at 51   pointing out the fao report failed to account for the 8,769 metric tons of respiratory co2 produced each year  undercounted methane production and land use associated with livestock  and failed to properly categorize emissions related to the slaughtering  processing  packaging  storing and transporting of animals and animal products  [33  [34   globally  enteric fermentation  mostly in ruminant livestock  accounts for about 27  of anthropogenic methane emissions  35  despite methane u2019s 100-year global warming potential  recently estimated at 28 without and 34 with climate carbon feedbacks  35  methane emission is currently contributing relatively little to global warming  over the decade 2000 through 2009  atmospheric methane content increased by an average of only 6 tg per year  because nearly all natural and anthropogenic methane emission was offset by degradation   while atmospheric carbon dioxide increased by nearly 15,000 tg per year  35  at the currently estimated rate of methane degradation  slight reduction of anthropogenic methane emissions  to about 98  of that decade u2019s average  would be expected to result in no further increase of atmospheric methane content  although reduction of methane emissions would have a rapid effect on warming  the expected effect would be small  36  other anthropogenic ghg emissions associated with livestock production include carbon dioxide from fossil fuel consumption  mostly for production  harvesting and transport of feed   and nitrous oxide emissions associated with use of nitrogenous fertilizers  growing of nitrogen-fixing legume vegetation and manure management  management practices that can mitigate ghg emissions from production of livestock and feed have been identified  37][38][39][40][41   livestock production  including feed production and grazing  uses about 30  of the earth u2019s ice-free terrestrial surface  about 26  for grazing and about 4  for other feed production  28  the intensity and duration of grazing use vary greatly 42  and these  together with terrain  vegetation and climate  influence the nature and importance of grazing u2019s environmental impact  which can range from severe to negligible  and in some cases  as noted below  beneficial  excessive use of vegetation by grazing can be especially conducive to land degradation in dry areas  43   considerable water use is associated with meat production  mostly because of water used in production of vegetation that provides feed  there are several published estimates of water use associated with livestock and meat production  but the amount of water use assignable to such production is seldom estimated  for example  \u201cgreen water u201d use is evapotranspirational use of soil water that has been provided directly by precipitation  and \u201cgreen water u201d has been estimated to account for 94  of global beef cattle production u2019s \u201cwater footprint u201d  44  and on rangeland  as much as 99.5  of the water use associated with beef production is \u201cgreen water u201d  however  it would be misleading simply to assign that associated rangeland green water use to beef production  partly because that evapotranspirational use occurs even in the absence of cattle  even when cattle are present  most of that associated water use can be considered assignable to production of terrestrial environmental values  because it produces root and residue biomass important for erosion control  stabilization of soil structure  nutrient cycling  carbon sequestration  support of numerous primary consumers  many of which support higher trophic levels  etc  withdrawn water  from surface and groundwater sources  is used for livestock watering  and in some cases is also used for irrigation of forage and feed crops  whereas all irrigation in the us  including loss in conveyance  is estimated to account for about 38  of us withdrawn freshwater use  45  irrigation water for production of livestock feed and forage has been estimated to account for about 9%;[46  other withdrawn freshwater use for the livestock sector  for drinking  washdown of facilities  etc   is estimated at about 0.7%.[45  because of the preponderance of non-meat products from the livestock sector 25  only some fraction of this water use is assignable to meat production   impairment of water quality by manure and other substances in runoff and infiltrating water is a concern  especially where intensive livestock production is carried out  in the us  in a comparison of 32 industries  the livestock industry was found to have a relatively good record of compliance with environmental regulations pursuant to the clean water act and clean air act  47  but pollution issues from large livestock operations can sometimes be serious where violations occur  various measures have been suggested by the us environmental protection agency  among others  which can help reduce livestock damage to streamwater quality and riparian environments  48   data of a usda study indicate that  in 2002  about 0.6  of non-solar energy use in the united states was accounted for by production of meat-producing livestock and poultry  49  this estimate included embodied energy used in production  such as energy used in manufacture and transport of fertilizer for feed production   non-solar energy is specified  because solar energy is used in such processes as photosynthesis and hay-drying    changes in livestock production practices influence the environmental impact of meat production  as illustrated by some beef data  in the us beef production system  practices prevailing in 2007 are estimated to have involved 8.6  less fossil fuel use  16.3  less greenhouse gas emissions  estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents   12.1  less withdrawn water use and 33.0  less land use  per unit mass of beef produced  than in 1977.[50  from 1980 to 2012 in the us  while population increased by 38   the small ruminant inventory decreased by 42   the cattle-and-calves inventory decreased by 17   and methane emissions from livestock decreased by 18%;[25  yet despite the reduction in cattle numbers  us beef production increased over that period  51   some impacts of meat-producing livestock may be considered environmentally beneficial  these include waste reduction by conversion of human-inedible crop residues to food  use of livestock as an alternative to herbicides for control of invasive and noxious weeds and other vegetation management  52  use of animal manure as fertilizer as a substitute for those synthetic fertilizers that require considerable fossil fuel use for manufacture  grazing use for wildlife habitat enhancement  53  and carbon sequestration in response to grazing practices  54][55  among others  conversely  according to some studies appearing in peer-reviewed journals the growing demand for meat is contributing to significant biodiversity loss as it is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction  56][57][58   palm oil  produced from the oil palm  is a basic source of income for many farmers in southeast asia  central and west africa  and central america  it is locally used as a cooking oil  exported for use in many commercial food and personal care products and is converted into biofuel  it produces up to 10 times more oil per unit area as soyabeans  rapeseed or sunflowers  oil palms produce 38  of vegetable oil output on 5  of the world u2019s vegetable-oil farmland  59  palm oil is under increasing scrutiny in relation to its effects on the environment   introductions of species  particularly plants into new areas  by whatever means and for whatever reasons have brought about major and permanent changes to the environment over large areas  examples include the introduction of caulerpa taxifolia into the mediterranean  the introduction of oat species into the california grasslands  and the introduction of privet  kudzu  and purple loosestrife to north america  rats  cats  and goats have radically altered biodiversity in many islands  additionally  introductions have resulted in genetic changes to native fauna where interbreeding has taken place  as with buffalo with domestic cattle  and wolves with domestic dogs   the environmental impact of energy harvesting and consumption is diverse  in recent years there has been a trend towards the increased commercialization of various renewable energy sources   in the real world  consumption of fossil fuel resources leads to global warming and climate change  however  little change is being made in many parts of the world  if the peak oil theory proves true  more explorations of viable alternative energy sources  could be more friendly to the environment   rapidly advancing technologies can achieve a transition of energy generation  water and waste management  and food production towards better environmental and energy usage practices using methods of systems ecology and industrial ecology  60][61   the environmental impact of biodiesel includes energy use  greenhouse gas emissions and some other kinds of pollution  a joint life cycle analysis by the us department of agriculture and the us department of energy found that substituting 100  biodiesel for petroleum diesel in buses reduced life cycle consumption of petroleum by 95   biodiesel reduced net emissions of carbon dioxide by 78.45   compared with petroleum diesel  in urban buses  biodiesel reduced particulate emissions 32 percent  carbon monoxide emissions 35 percent  and emissions of sulfur oxides 8   relative to life cycle emissions associated with use of petroleum diesel  life cycle emissions of hydrocarbons were 35  higher and emission of various nitrogen oxides  nox  were 13.5  higher with biodiesel  62  life cycle analyses by the argonne national laboratory have indicated reduced fossil energy use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions with biodiesel  compared with petroleum diesel use  63  biodiesel derived from various vegetable oils  e g  canola or soybean oil   is readily biodegradable in the environment compared with petroleum diesel  64   the environmental impact of coal mining and -burning is diverse  65  legislation passed by the us congress in 1990 required the united states environmental protection agency  epa  to issue a plan to alleviate toxic air pollution from coal-fired power plants  after delay and litigation  the epa now has a court-imposed deadline of march 16  2011  to issue its report   the environmental impact of electricity generation is significant because modern society uses large amounts of electrical power  this power is normally generated at power plants that convert some other kind of energy into electricity  each such system has advantages and disadvantages  but many of them pose environmental concerns   the environmental impact of nuclear power results from the nuclear fuel cycle processes including mining  processing  transporting and storing fuel and radioactive fuel waste  released radioisotopes pose a health danger to human populations  animals and plants as radioactive particles enter organisms through various transmission routes   radiation is a carcinogen and causes numerous effects on living organisms and systems  the environmental impacts of nuclear power plant disasters such as the chernobyl disaster  the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster and the three mile island accident  among others  persist indefinitely  though several other factors contributed to these events including improper management of fail safe systems and natural disasters putting uncommon stress on the generators  the radioactive decay rate of particles varies greatly  dependent upon the nuclear properties of a particular isotope  radioactive plutonium-244 has a half-life of 80.8 million years  which indicates the time duration required for half of a given sample to decay  though very little plutonium-244 is produced in the nuclear fuel cycle and lower half-life materials have lower activity thus giving off less dangerous radiation  66   the environmental impact of the oil shale industry includes the consideration of issues such as land use  waste management  and water and air pollution caused by the extraction and processing of oil shale  surface mining of oil shale deposits causes the usual environmental impacts of open-pit mining  in addition  the combustion and thermal processing generate waste material  which must be disposed of  and harmful atmospheric emissions  including carbon dioxide  a major greenhouse gas  experimental in-situ conversion processes and carbon capture and storage technologies may reduce some of these concerns in future  but may raise others  such as the pollution of groundwater  67   the environmental impact of petroleum is often negative because it is toxic to almost all forms of life  climate change exists  petroleum  commonly referred to as oil  is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society  especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities   the environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases   dams and the reservoirs can be used to supply drinking water  generate hydroelectric power  increasing the water supply for irrigation  provide recreational opportunities and flood control  however  adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions  although the impact varies greatly between different dams and reservoirs  common criticisms include preventing sea-run fish from reaching their historical mating grounds  less access to water downstream  and a smaller catch for fishing communities in the area  advances in technology have provided solutions to many negative impacts of dams but these advances are often not viewed as worth investing in if not required by law or under the threat of fines  whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimental u2014to both the environment and surrounding human populations u2014 has been debated since the 1960s and probably long before that  in 1960 the construction of llyn celyn and the flooding of capel celyn provoked political uproar which continues to this day  more recently  the construction of three gorges dam and other similar projects throughout asia  africa and latin america have generated considerable environmental and political debate   compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources  the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor  wind powered electricity generation consumes no fuel  and emits no air pollution  unlike fossil fuel power sources  the energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months  while a wind farm may cover a large area of land  many land uses such as agriculture are compatible  with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use  68   there are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines  as there are around other artificial structures  the scale of the ecological impact may 69  or may not 70  be significant  depending on specific circumstances  prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities  and protection of peat bogs  71  affect the siting and operation of wind turbines   there are conflicting reports about the effects of noise on people who live very close to a wind turbine   artificial light at night is one of the most obvious physical changes that humans have made to the biosphere  and is the easiest form of pollution to observe from space  72  the main environmental impacts of artificial light are due to light s use as an information source  rather than an energy source   the hunting efficiency of visual predators generally increases under artificial light  changing predator prey interactions  artificial light also affects dispersal  orientation  migration  and hormone levels  resulting in disrupted circadian rhythms  73   the environmental impact of cleaning agents is diverse  in recent years  measures have been taken to reduce these effects   nanotechnology s environmental impact can be split into two aspects  the potential for nanotechnological innovations to help improve the environment  and the possibly novel type of pollution that nanotechnological materials might cause if released into the environment  as nanotechnology is an emerging field  there is great debate regarding to what extent industrial and commercial use of nanomaterials will affect organisms and ecosystems   the environmental impact of paint is diverse  traditional painting materials and processes can have harmful effects on the environment  including those from the use of lead and other additives  measures can be taken to reduce environmental impact  including accurately estimating paint quantities so that wastage is minimized  use of paints  coatings  painting accessories and techniques that are environmentally preferred  the united states environmental protection agency guidelines and green star ratings are some of the standards that can be applied   the environmental impact of paper is significant  which has led to changes in industry and behaviour at both business and personal levels  with the use of modern technology such as the printing press and the highly mechanised harvesting of wood  paper has become a cheap commodity  this has led to a high level of consumption and waste  with the rise in environmental awareness due to the lobbying by environmental organizations and with increased government regulation there is now a trend towards sustainability in the pulp and paper industry   the environmental impact of pesticides is often greater than what is intended by those who use them  over 98  of sprayed insecticides and 95  of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species  including nontarget species  air  water  bottom sediments  and food  74  pesticide contaminates land and water when it escapes from production sites and storage tanks  when it runs off from fields  when it is discarded  when it is sprayed aerially  and when it is sprayed into water to kill algae  75   the amount of pesticide that migrates from the intended application area is influenced by the particular chemical s properties  its propensity for binding to soil  its vapor pressure  its water solubility  and its resistance to being broken down over time  76  factors in the soil  such as its texture  its ability to retain water  and the amount of organic matter contained in it  also affect the amount of pesticide that will leave the area  76  some pesticides contribute to global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer  77   the environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products  ppcps  is largely speculative  ppcps are substances used by individuals for personal health or cosmetic reasons and the products used by agribusiness to boost growth or health of livestock  ppcps have been detected in water bodies throughout the world  the effects of these chemicals on humans and the environment are not yet known  but to date there is no scientific evidence that they affect human health  78   the environmental impact of mining includes erosion  formation of sinkholes  loss of biodiversity  and contamination of soil  groundwater and surface water by chemicals from mining processes  in some cases  additional forest logging is done in the vicinity of mines to increase the available room for the storage of the created debris and soil  79  besides creating environmental damage  the contamination resulting from leakage of chemicals also affect the health of the local population  80  mining companies in some countries are required to follow environmental and rehabilitation codes  ensuring the area mined is returned to close to its original state  some mining methods may have significant environmental and public health effects   the environmental impact of transport is significant because it is a major user of energy  and burns most of the world s petroleum  this creates air pollution  including nitrous oxides and particulates  and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide  81  for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector  82  by subsector  road transport is the largest contributor to global warming  81   environmental regulations in developed countries have reduced the individual vehicles emission  however  this has been offset by an increase in the number of vehicles  and more use of each vehicle  81  some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied  83  energy use and emissions vary largely between modes  causing environmentalists to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport  and increase transport electrification and energy efficiency   other environmental impacts of transport systems include traffic congestion and automobile-oriented urban sprawl  which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands  by reducing transportation emissions globally  it is predicted that there will be significant positive effects on earth s air quality  acid rain  smog and climate change  84   the health impact of transport emissions is also of concern  a recent survey of the studies on the effect of traffic emissions on pregnancy outcomes has linked exposure to emissions to adverse effects on gestational duration and possibly also intrauterine growth  85   the environmental impact of aviation occurs because aircraft engines emit noise  particulates  and gases which contribute to climate change 86][87  and global dimming  88  despite emission reductions from automobiles and more fuel-efficient and less polluting turbofan and turboprop engines  the rapid growth of air travel in recent years contributes to an increase in total pollution attributable to aviation  in the eu  greenhouse gas emissions from aviation increased by 87  between 1990 and 2006.[89  among other factors leading to this phenomenon are the increasing number of hypermobile travellers 90  and social factors that are making air travel commonplace  such as frequent flyer programs  90   there is an ongoing debate about possible taxation of air travel and the inclusion of aviation in an emissions trading scheme  with a view to ensuring that the total external costs of aviation are taken into account  91   the environmental impact of roads includes the local effects of highways  public roads  such as on noise  light pollution  water pollution  habitat destruction disturbance and local air quality  and the wider effects including climate change from vehicle emissions  the design  construction and management of roads  parking and other related facilities as well as the design and regulation of vehicles can change the impacts to varying degrees   the environmental impact of shipping includes greenhouse gas emissions and oil pollution  in 2007  carbon dioxide emissions from shipping were estimated at 4 to 5  of the global total  and estimated by the international maritime organisation  imo  to rise by up to 72  by 2020 if no action is taken  92  there is also a potential for introducing invasive species into new areas through shipping  usually by attaching themselves to the ship s hull   the first intersessional meeting of the imo working group on greenhouse gas emissions 93  from ships took place in oslo  norway on 23\u201327 june 2008  it was tasked with developing the technical basis for the reduction mechanisms that may form part of a future imo regime to control greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping  and a draft of the actual reduction mechanisms themselves  for further consideration by imo u2019s marine environment protection committee (mepc   94   as well as the cost to human life and society  there is a significant environmental impact of war  scorched earth methods during  or after war have been in use for much of recorded history but with modern technology war can cause a far greater devastation on the environment  unexploded ordnance can render land unusable for further use or make access across it dangerous or fatal   human impact on biodiversity is significant  humans have caused the extinction of many species  including the dodo and  potentially  large megafaunal species during the last ice age  95  though most experts agree that human beings have accelerated the rate of species extinction  the exact degree of this impact is unknown  perhaps 100 to 1000 times the normal background rate of extinction  96][97  some scholars have postulated that without human interference the biodiversity of the earth would continue to grow at an exponential rate  1   human impact on coral reefs is significant  coral reefs are dying around the world  98  in particular  coral mining  pollution  organic and non-organic   overfishing  blast fishing and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are serious threats to these ecosystems  coral reefs also face high dangers from pollution  diseases  destructive fishing practices and warming oceans  99  in order to find answers for these problems  researchers study the various factors that impact reefs  the list of factors is long  including the ocean s role as a carbon dioxide sink  atmospheric changes  ultraviolet light  ocean acidification  biological virus  impacts of dust storms carrying agents to far flung reefs  pollutants  algal blooms and others  reefs are threatened well beyond coastal areas   general estimates show approximately 10  world s coral reefs are already dead  100][101][102  it is estimated that about 60  of the world s reefs are at risk due to destructive  human-related activities  the threat to the health of reefs is particularly strong in southeast asia  where 80  of reefs are endangered   global warming is the result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations which is caused primarily by the combustion of fossil energy sources such as petroleum  coal  and natural gas  and to an unknown extent by destruction of forests  increased methane  volcanic activity and cement production  such massive alteration of the global carbon cycle has only been possible because of the availability and deployment of advanced technologies  ranging in application from fossil fuel exploration  extraction  distribution  refining  and combustion in power plants and automobile engines and advanced farming practices  livestock contributes to climate change both thru the production of greenhouse gases and thru destruction of carbon sinks such as rain-forests  according to the 2006 united nations fao report  18  of all greenhouse gas emissions found in the atmosphere are due to livestock  the raising of livestock and the land needed to feed them has resulted in the destruction millions of acres of rainforest and as global demand for meat rises  so too will the demand for land  ninety-one percent of all rainforest land deforested since 1970 is now used for livestock  [103  potential negative environmental impacts caused by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are rising global air temperatures  altered hydrogeological cycles resulting in more frequent and severe droughts  storms  and floods  as well as sea level rise and ecosystem disruption  104   human impact on the nitrogen cycle is diverse  agricultural and industrial nitrogen  n  inputs to the environment currently exceed inputs from natural n fixation  105][106  as a consequence of anthropogenic inputs  the global nitrogen cycle  fig  1  has been significantly altered over the past century  global atmospheric nitrous oxide (n2o  mole fractions have increased from a pre-industrial value of ~270 nmol mol to ~319 nmol mol in 2005.[107  human activities account for over one-third of n2o emissions  most of which are due to the agricultural sector  107
