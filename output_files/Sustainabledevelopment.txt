Sustainabledevelopment
 sustainable development is the organizing principle for meeting human development goals while at the same time sustaining the ability of natural systems to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services upon which the economy and society depends  the desirable end result is a state of society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural systems   while the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 brundtland report  it is also rooted in earlier ideas about sustainable forest management and twentieth century environmental concerns  as the concept developed  it has shifted to focus more on economic development  social development and environmental protection for future generations  it has been suggested that  the term  sustainability  should be viewed as humanity s target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium  homeostasis   while  sustainable development  refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability   1   the concept of sustainable development has been \u2014 and still is \u2014 subject to criticism  what  exactly  is to be sustained in sustainable development  it has been argued that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a non-renewable resource  since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth s finite stock  this perspective renders the industrial revolution as a whole unsustainable  it has also been argued that the meaning of the concept has opportunistically been stretched from  conservation management  to  economic development   and that the brundtland report promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development  with an ambiguous and insubstantial concept attached as a public relations slogan       sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining processes of productivity indefinitely u2014natural or human made u2014by replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems  3  sustainable development ties together concern for the carrying capacity of natural systems with the social  political  and economic challenges faced by humanity  sustainability science is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science  there is an additional focus on the present generations  responsibility to regenerate  maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations  4   sustainable development has its roots in ideas about sustainable forest management which were developed in europe during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries  5][6  in response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in england  john evelyn argued that  sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner  in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources  in his 1662 essay sylva  in 1713 hans carl von carlowitz  a senior mining administrator in the service of elector frederick augustus i of saxony published sylvicultura oeconomica  a 400-page work on forestry  building upon the ideas of evelyn and french minister jean-baptiste colbert  von carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for sustained yield  5  his work influenced others  including alexander von humboldt and georg ludwig hartig  eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry  this in turn influenced people like gifford pinchot  first head of the us forest service  whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources  and aldo leopold whose land ethic was influential in the development of the environmental movement in the 1960s  5][6   following the publication of rachel carson s silent spring in 1962  the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation  kenneth e  boulding in his influential 1966 essay the economics of the coming spaceship earth identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources  6  one of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the club of rome in 1972 in its classic report on the limits to growth  written by a group of scientists led by dennis and donella meadows of the massachusetts institute of technology  describing the desirable  state of global equilibrium   the authors wrote   we are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people   4   in 1980 the international union for the conservation of nature published a world conservation strategy that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority 7  and introduced the term  sustainable development   8  two years later  the united nations world charter for nature raised five principles of conservation by which human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged  9  in 1987 the united nations world commission on environment and development released the report our common future  commonly called the brundtland report  the report included what is now one of the most widely recognised definitions of sustainable development  10][11   since the brundtland report  the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of  socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth   12  in 1992  the un conference on environment and development published the earth charter  which outlines the building of a just  sustainable  and peaceful global society in the 21st century  the action plan agenda 21 for sustainable development identified information  integration  and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars  it emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information  it stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes  furthermore  agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development  13   under the principles of the united nations charter the millennium declaration identified principles and treaties on sustainable development  including economic development  social development and environmental protection  broadly defined  sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural  produced  and social capital for the welfare of their own and future generations  the term sustainable development as used by the united nations incorporates both issues associated with land development and broader issues of human development such as education  public health  and standard of living  citation needed   a 2013 study concluded that sustainability reporting should be reframed through the lens of four interconnected domains  ecology  economics  politics and culture  14   in september 2015  the united nations general assembly formally adopted the  universal  integrated and transformative  2030 agenda for sustainable development  a set of 17 sustainable development goals  sdgs   the goals are to be implemented and achieved in every country from the year 2016 to 2030   sustainable development  or sustainability  has been described in terms of three spheres  dimensions  domains or pillars  i e  the environment  the economy and society  the three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist ren xe9 passet in 1979.[15  it has also been worded as  economic  environmental and social  or  ecology  economy and equity   16  this has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture  17][18  institutions or governance  16   the ecological stability of human settlements is part of the relationship between humans and their natural  social and built environments  19  also termed human ecology  this broadens the focus of sustainable development to include the domain of human health  fundamental human needs such as the availability and quality of air  water  food and shelter are also the ecological foundations for sustainable development  20  addressing public health risk through investments in ecosystem services can be a powerful and transformative force for sustainable development which  in this sense  extends to all species  21   environmental sustainability concerns the natural environment and how it endures and remains diverse and productive  since natural resources are derived from the environment  the state of air  water  and the climate are of particular concern  the ipcc fifth assessment report outlines current knowledge about scientific  technical and socio-economic information concerning climate change  and lists options for adaptation and mitigation  22  environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet  this  for example  entails using water sustainably  utilizing renewable energy  and sustainable material supplies  e g  harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity   citation needed   an unsustainable situation occurs when natural capital  the sum total of nature s resources  is used up faster than it can be replenished  sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature s resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally  inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity  theoretically  the long-term result of environmental degradation is the inability to sustain human life  such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support  citation needed  if the degradation continues beyond a certain tipping point or critical threshold it would lead to eventual extinction for humanity  citation needed   integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities  a telling example is the european environmental research and innovation policy  which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development  research and innovation in europe is financially supported by the programme horizon 2020  which is also open to participation worldwide  23  a promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible  24][25   pollution of the public resources is really not a different action  it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons  in that instead of taking something out  something is put into the commons  when the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed  then it becomes only natural to pollute  as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons  so  the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it  through taxes or fines  more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge  26   so  one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual  but in the absence of any direct consequences  the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public  once again  this issue needs to be addressed  because  left unaddressed  the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way  so  this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use   sustainable agriculture consists of environment friendly methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems  it involves preventing adverse effects to soil  water  biodiversity  surrounding or downstream resources u2014as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas  the concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally  passing on a conserved or improved natural resource  biotic  and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted  27  elements of sustainable agriculture include permaculture  agroforestry  mixed farming  multiple cropping  and crop rotation  28   numerous sustainability standards and certification systems exist  including organic certification  rainforest alliance  fair trade  utz certified  bird friendly  and the common code for the coffee community (4c   29][30   it has been suggested that because of rural poverty and overexploitation  environmental resources should be treated as important economic assets  called natural capital  31  economic development has traditionally required a growth in the gross domestic product  this model of unlimited personal and gdp growth may be over  32  sustainable development may involve improvements in the quality of life for many but may necessitate a decrease in resource consumption  33  according to ecological economist malte faber  ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature  justice  and time  issues of intergenerational equity  irreversibility of environmental change  uncertainty of long-term outcomes  and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation  34   as early as the 1970s  the concept of sustainability was used to describe an economy  in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems   35  scientists in many fields have highlighted the limits to growth  36][37  and economists have presented alternatives  for example a  steady-state economy   38  to address concerns over the impacts of expanding human development on the planet  in 1987 the economist edward barbier published the study the concept of sustainable economic development  where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other  39   a world bank study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings  policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability  in macroeconomics or purely environmental  40  a study from 2001 noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare  eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state  41  the study  interpreting sustainability in economic terms  found three pillars of sustainable development  interlinkage  intergenerational equity  and dynamic efficiency  42   but gilbert rist points out that the world bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem  he writes   from this angle   sustainable development  looks like a cover-up operation      the thing that is meant to be sustained is really  development   not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies   43   the world bank  a leading producer of environmental knowledge  continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts  44  herman daly  an economist for the bank from 1988 to 1994  writes   when authors of wdr '92  the highly influential 1992 world development report that featured the environment  were drafting the report  they called me asking for examples of  win-win  strategies in my work  what could i say  none exists in that pure form  there are trade-offs  not  win-wins   but they want to see a world of  win-wins  based on articles of faith  not fact  i wanted to contribute because wdrs are important in the bank   because  task managers read  them  to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects  but they did not want to hear about how things really are  or what i find in my work     45   a meta review in 2002 looked at environmental and economic valuations and found a lack of  sustainability policies   46  a study in 2004 asked if we consume too much  47  a study concluded in 2007 that knowledge  manufactured and human capital  health and education  has not compensated for the degradation of natural capital in many parts of the world  48  it has been suggested that intergenerational equity can be incorporated into a sustainable development and decision making  as has become common in economic valuations of climate economics  49  a meta review in 2009 identified conditions for a strong case to act on climate change  and called for more work to fully account of the relevant economics and how it affects human welfare  50  according to free-market environmentalist john baden  the improvement of environment quality depends on the market economy and the existence of legitimate and protected property rights   they enable the effective practice of personal responsibility and the development of mechanisms to protect the environment  the state can in this context  create conditions which encourage the people to save the environment   51   misum  mistra center for sustainable markets  based at stockholm school of economics  aims to provide policy research and advice to swedish and international actors on sustainable markets  misum is a cross-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder knowledge center dedicated to sustainability and sustainable markets and contains three research platforms  sustainability in financial markets  mistra financial systems   sustainability in production and consumption and sustainable socio-economic development  52   the total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth  air  and water  but also human interactions with these things  with nature  and what humans have created as their surroundings  53   as countries around the world continue to advance economically  they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth  therefore  solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow  but not at the expense of the public good  in the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource  this is a resource to be protected  one common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis  this type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and  based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions  the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited  54   benefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution  based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action  and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place  further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action  sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action  due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis  citation needed   sustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time  unlike fossil fuels and biofuels that provide the bulk of the worlds energy  renewable energy sources like hydroelectric  solar and wind energy produce far less pollution  55][56  solar energy is commonly used on public parking meters  street lights and the roof of buildings  57  wind power has expanded quickly  its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1%.[58  most of california s fossil fuel infrastructures are sited in or near low-income communities  and have traditionally suffered the most from california s fossil fuel energy system  these communities are historically left out during the decision-making process  and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area  these toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities  as renewable energy becomes more common  fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables  providing better social equity to these communities  59  overall  and in the long run  sustainable development in the field of energy is also deemed to contribute to economic sustainability and national security of communities  thus being increasingly encouraged through investment policies  60   one of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people meet their developmental needs  technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as appropriate technology  which is an ideological movement  and its manifestations  originally articulated as intermediate technology by the economist e  f  schumacher in his influential work  small is beautiful  and now covers a wide range of technologies  61  both schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasise the technology as people-centered  62  today appropriate technology is often developed using open source principles  which have led to open-source appropriate technology  osat  and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the internet  63  osat has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for sustainable development  64][65   transportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions  it is said that one-third of all gasses produced are due to transportation  66  motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change  67   sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development  according to a series of reports by the low emission development strategies global partnership  leds gp   sustainable transport can help create jobs  68  improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways  69  make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient  it also offers a practical opportunity to save people s time and household income as well as government budgets  70  making investment in sustainable transport a  win-win  opportunity   some western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations  71  an example is the modifications in available transportation in freiburg  germany  the city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation  cycling  and walking  along with large areas where cars are not allowed  66   since many western countries are highly automobile-orientated areas  the main transit that people use is personal vehicles  about 80  of their travel involves cars  66  therefore  california  is one of the highest greenhouse gases emitters in the united states  the federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission  such as   other states and nations have built efforts to translate knowledge in behavioral economics into evidence-based sustainable transportation policies  citation needed   the most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm s efficient use of natural capital  this eco-efficiency is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact  74  this idea has been popularised by the world business council for sustainable development  wbcsd  under the following definition   eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life  while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth s carrying capacity    desimone and popoff  1997  47)[75   similar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability  socio-efficiency 76  describes the relation between a firm s value added and its social impact  whereas  it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative  apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees  this is not true for social impacts  these can be either positive  e g  corporate giving  creation of employment  or negative  e g  work accidents  mobbing of employees  human rights abuses   depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts  i e  accidents per value added  or maximise positive social impacts  i e  donations per value added  in relation to the value added  citation needed   both eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability  in this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations  however  as dyllick and hockerts 76  point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development  they point towards eco-effectiveness  socio-effectiveness  sufficiency  and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached  citation needed   casi global  new york  csr  amp  sustainability together lead to sustainable development  csr as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits  but is the way you make profits  this means csr is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of hr   independent department  sustainability as in effects towards human resources  environment and ecology has to be measured within each department of the company  http   casiglobal us   at the present time  sustainable development  along with the solidarity called for in catholic social teaching  can reduce poverty  while over many thousands of years the \u2018stronger u2019

classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction  that appreciates and develops smart growth  architectural tradition and classical design  78][79  this in contrast to modernist and international style architecture  as well as opposing to solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl  with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints  80  both trends started in the 1980s   it should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain   citation needed   a study concluded that social indicators and  therefore  sustainable development indicators  are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making  81  the international institute for sustainable development has similarly developed a political policy framework  linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics  the framework consists of six core areas  international trade and investment  economic policy  climate change and energy  measurement and assessment  natural resource management  and the role of communication technologies in sustainable development   the united nations global compact cities programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance  the political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation  authorisation  legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common  this definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic  ecological and cultural challenges  it also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed  they have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics  82   this accords with the brundtland commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles  see above    working with a different emphasis  some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development  since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic  environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society  in this context  the agenda 21 for culture and the united cities and local governments  uclg  executive bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement  culture  fourth pillar of sustainable development   passed on 17 november 2010  in the framework of the world summit of local and regional leaders xa0\u2013 3rd world congress of uclg  held in mexico city  this document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach  developing a solid cultural policy and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies  the circles of sustainability approach distinguishes the four domains of economic  ecological  political and cultural sustainability  83][84][85   other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development  the network of excellence  sustainable development in a diverse world   86  sponsored by the european union  integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets cultural diversity as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development  the fourth pillar of sustainable development theory has been referenced by executive director of imi institute at unesco vito di bari 87  in his manifesto of art and architectural movement neo-futurism  whose name was inspired by the 1987 united nations u2019 report our common future  the circles of sustainability approach used by metropolis defines the  fourth  cultural domain as practices  discourses  and material expressions  which  over time  express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning  82   the united nations conference on sustainable development  uncsd  also known as rio 2012  was the third international conference on sustainable development  which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community  an outcome of this conference was the development of the sustainable development goals that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world  however  few nations met the world wide fund for nature s definition of sustainable development criteria established in 2006.[88  although some nations are more developed than others  all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities  inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms  89   in 2007 a report for the u s  environmental protection agency stated   while much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators  none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable  at best  they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction  or that our current activities are not sustainable  more often  they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems  doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them   90  nevertheless  a majority of authors assume that a set of well defined and harmonised indicators is the only way to make sustainability tangible  those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations  trial and error   91   the most common critiques are related to issues like data quality  comparability  objective function and the necessary resources  92  however a more general criticism is coming from the project management community  how can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project  93][94   the cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur sonia bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral  long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project  activity or enterprise  95][96  furthermore  this concept aims to be a practical guideline towards sustainable development following the principle of conservation and increment of value rather than restricting the consumption of resources  citation needed   reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen u s  green building council s  usgbc  leadership in energy and environmental design  leed   this design incorporates some ecological  economic  and social elements  the goals presented by leed design goals are sustainable sites  water efficiency  energy and atmospheric emission reduction  material and resources efficiency  and indoor environmental quality  although amount of structures for sustainability development is many  these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building  citation needed   recent research efforts created also the sdewes index to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy  water and environment systems  the sdewes index consists of 7 dimensions  35 indicators  and close to 20 sub-indicators  it is currently applied to 58 cities  97   the sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital  economic  social  and natural   which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible  98  leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist herman daly  38  for example  points to the fact that natural capital can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital  while it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources  it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services  such as the protection provided by the ozone layer  or the climate stabilizing function of the amazonian forest  in fact natural capital  social capital and economic capital are often complementarities  a further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources  forests  for example  not only provide the raw material for paper  which can be substituted quite easily   but they also maintain biodiversity  regulate water flow  and absorb co2  citation needed   another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility  the loss of biodiversity  for example  is often definitive  the same can be true for cultural diversity  for example  with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates  moreover  the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences  consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached  a lake can  for example  absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity  however  once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake s ecosystem to break down suddenly  citation needed   if the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it  cohen and winn 99  point to four types of market failure as possible explanations  first  while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised  the costs are often externalised  i e  they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general   second  natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital  information asymmetry is a third reason u2014often the link between cause and effect is obscured  making it difficult for actors to make informed choices  cohen and winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers  they postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a  business as usual  mentality  citation needed   main page  education for sustainable development  education must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable  this vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social  environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education  \u2018an empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive  to continue to learn  to solve problems  to be creative  and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony  when nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives  a quiet revolution is set in motion  education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world  u2019[100][101   higher education

argued that since the 1960s  the concept of sustainable development has changed from  conservation management  to  economic development   whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat  102]:48\u201354  in the 1960s  the international community realised that many african countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats  and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil  climate and water availability  this was a strategy of conservation management  in the 70s  however  the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs  community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries  and not just in africa   this was a strategy of economic development  and the strategy was carried even further by the the brundtland commission s report on our common future when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application  102]:48\u201354 in effect  the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers   but shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of sustainable yield from the use of renewable resources only  like forestry   to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources  like minerals   103]:13 this stretching of the term has been questioned  thus  environmental economist kerry turner has argued that literally  there can be no such thing as overall  sustainable development  in an industrialised world economy that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth s finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources   in effect  it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable  104]:20f [38]:22f [105]:61\u201367 [106]:52  one critic has argued that the brundtland commission promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development

issue demanded more economic growth  also in the rich countries  who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out \u2014 as usual  when the discussion switched to global ecological limits to growth  the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency  or what was termed  a change in the quality of growth   however  most countries in the west had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early 20th century already and as usual  only  this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion  to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before \u2014 and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report  taken together  the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact  since the publication of the report  the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of  sustainable development  has marched on
