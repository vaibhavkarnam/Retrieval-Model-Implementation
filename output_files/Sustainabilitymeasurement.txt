Sustainabilitymeasurement
 sustainability measurement is the quantitative basis for the informed management of sustainability  1  the metrics used for the measurement of sustainability  involving the sustainability of environmental  social and economic domains  both individually and in various combinations  are still evolving  they include indicators  benchmarks  audits  indexes and accounting  as well as assessment  appraisal 2  and other reporting systems  they are applied over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales  3][4   some of the best known and most widely used sustainability measures include corporate sustainability reporting  triple bottom line accounting  and estimates of the quality of sustainability governance for individual countries using the environmental sustainability index and environmental performance index  an alternative approach  used by the united nations global compact cities programme and explicitly critical of the triple-bottom-line approach is circles of sustainability       the principal objective of sustainability indicators is to inform public policy-making as part of the process of sustainability governance  5  sustainability indicators can provide information on any aspect of the interplay between the environment and socio-economic activities  6  building strategic indicator sets generally deals with just a few simple questions  what is happening   descriptive indicators   does it matter and are we reaching targets   performance indicators   are we improving   efficiency indicators   are measures working   policy effectiveness indicators   and are we generally better off   total welfare indicators   one popular general framework used by the european environment agency uses a slight modification of the organisation for economic co-operation and development dpsir system  7  this breaks up environmental impact into five stages  social and economic developments  consumption and production   d rive or initiate environmental  p ressures which  in turn  produces a change in the  s tate of the environment which leads to  i mpacts of various kinds  societal  r esponses  policy guided by sustainability indicators  can be introduced at any stage of this sequence of events   the united nations has developed extensive sustainability measurement tools in relation to sustainable development [8  as well as a system of integrated environmental and economic accounting  9   in the last couple of decades there has arisen a crowded toolbox of quantitative methods used to assess sustainability \u2014 including measures of resource use like life cycle assessment  measures of consumption like the ecological footprint and measurements of quality of environmental governance like the environmental performance index  the following is a list of quantitative  tools  used by sustainability scientists - the different categories are for convenience only as defining criteria will intergrade  it would be too difficult to list all those methods available at different levels of organisation so those listed here are at for the global level only   part of this process can relate to resource use such as energy accounting or to economic metrics or price system values as compared to non-market economics potential  for understanding resource use  21  an important task for resource theory  energy economics  is to develop methods to optimize resource conversion processes  22  these systems are described and analyzed by means of the methods of mathematics and the natural sciences  23  human factors  however  have dominated the development of our perspective of the relationship between nature and society since at least the industrial revolution  and in particular have influenced how we describe and measure the economic impacts of changes in resource quality  a balanced view of these issues requires an understanding of the physical framework in which all human ideas  institutions  and aspirations must operate  24   when oil production first began in the mid-nineteenth century  the largest oil fields recovered fifty barrels of oil for every barrel used in the extraction  transportation and refining  this ratio is often referred to as the energy return on energy investment  eroi or eroei   currently  between one and five barrels of oil are recovered for each barrel-equivalent of energy used in the recovery process  as the eroei drops to one  or equivalently the net energy gain falls to zero  the oil production is no longer a net energy source  this happens long before the resource is physically exhausted   note that it is important to understand the distinction between a barrel of oil  which is a measure of oil  and a barrel of oil equivalent  boe   which is a measure of energy  many sources of energy  such as fission  solar  wind  and coal  are not subject to the same near-term supply restrictions that oil is  accordingly  even an oil source with an eroei of 0.5 can be usefully exploited if the energy required to produce that oil comes from a cheap and plentiful energy source  availability of cheap  but hard to transport  natural gas in some oil fields has led to using natural gas to fuel enhanced oil recovery  similarly  natural gas in huge amounts is used to power most athabasca tar sands plants  cheap natural gas has also led to ethanol fuel produced with a net eroei of less than 1  although figures in this area are controversial because methods to measure eroei are in debate   insofar as economic growth is driven by oil consumption growth  post-peak societies must adapt  m  king hubbert believed  25   some economists describe the problem as uneconomic growth or a false economy  at the political right  fred ikle has warned about  conservatives addicted to the utopia of perpetual growth   26  brief oil interruptions in 1973 and 1979 markedly slowed - but did not stop - the growth of world gdp  27   between 1950 and 1984  as the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe  world grain production increased by 250   the energy for the green revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers  natural gas   pesticides  oil   and hydrocarbon fueled irrigation  28   david pimentel  professor of ecology and agriculture at cornell university  and mario giampietro  senior researcher at the national research institute on food and nutrition  inran   place in their study food  land  population and the u s  economy the maximum u s  population for a sustainable economy at 200 million  to achieve a sustainable economy world population will have to be reduced by two-thirds  says the study  29  without population reduction  this study predicts an agricultural crisis beginning in 2020  becoming critical c  2050  the peaking of global oil along with the decline in regional natural gas production may precipitate this agricultural crisis sooner than generally expected  dale allen pfeiffer claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level such as never experienced before  30][31   although hubbert peak theory receives most attention in relation to peak oil production  it has also been applied to other natural resources   doug reynolds predicted in 2005 that the north american peak would occur in 2007.[32  bentley (p  xa0189  predicted a world  decline in conventional gas production from about 2020".[33   peak coal is significantly further out than peak oil  but we can observe the example of anthracite in the usa  a high grade coal whose production peaked in the 1920s  anthracite was studied by hubbert  and matches a curve closely  34  pennsylvania s coal production also matches hubbert s curve closely  but this does not mean that coal in pennsylvania is exhausted u2014far from it  if production in pennsylvania returned at its all-time high  there are reserves for 190 years  hubbert had recoverable coal reserves worldwide at 2500 \xd7 109 metric tons and peaking around 2150 depending on usage    more recent estimates suggest an earlier peak  coal  resources and future production  pdf 630kb [35    published on april 5  2007 by the energy watch group  ewg   which reports to the german parliament  found that global coal production could peak in as few as 15 years  36  reporting on this richard heinberg also notes that the date of peak annual energetic extraction from coal will likely come earlier than the date of peak in quantity of coal  tons per year  extracted as the most energy-dense types of coal have been mined most extensively  37  a second study  the future of coal by b  kavalov and s  d  peteves of the institute for energy  ife   prepared for european commission joint research centre  reaches similar conclusions and states that   coal might not be so abundant  widely available and reliable as an energy source in the future   36   work by david rutledge of caltech predicts that the total of world coal production will amount to only about 450 gigatonnes  38  this implies that coal is running out faster than usually assumed   finally  insofar as global peak oil and peak in natural gas are expected anywhere from imminently to within decades at most  any increase in coal production  mining  per annum to compensate for declines in oil or ng production  would necessarily translate to an earlier date of peak as compared with peak coal under a scenario in which annual production remains constant   in a paper in 1956,[39  after a review of us fissionable reserves  hubbert notes of nuclear power   technologies such as the thorium fuel cycle  reprocessing and fast breeders can  in theory  considerably extend the life of uranium reserves  roscoe bartlett claims [40   caltech physics professor david goodstein has stated 41  that  hubbert applied his theory to  rock containing an abnormally high concentration of a given metal  42  and reasoned that the peak production for metals such as copper  tin  lead  zinc and others would occur in the time frame of decades and iron in the time frame of two centuries like coal  the price of copper rose 500  between 2003 and 2007[43  was by some attributed to peak copper  44][45  copper prices later fell  along with many other commodities and stock prices  as demand shrank from fear of a global recession  46  lithium availability is a concern for a fleet of li-ion battery using cars but a paper published in 1996 estimated that world reserves are adequate for at least 50 years  47  a similar prediction [48  for platinum use in fuel cells notes that the metal could be easily recycled   phosphorus supplies are essential to farming and depletion of reserves is estimated at somewhere from 60 to 130 years  49  individual countries supplies vary widely  without a recycling initiative america s supply [50  is estimated around 30 years  51  phosphorus supplies affect total agricultural output which in turn limits alternative fuels such as biodiesel and ethanol   hubbert s original analysis did not apply to renewable resources  however over-exploitation often results in a hubbert peak nonetheless  a modified hubbert curve applies to any resource that can be harvested faster than it can be replaced  52   for example  a reserve such as the ogallala aquifer can be mined at a rate that far exceeds replenishment  this turns much of the world s underground water [53  and lakes [54  into finite resources with peak usage debates similar to oil  these debates usually center around agriculture and suburban water usage but generation of electricity [55  from nuclear energy or coal and tar sands mining mentioned above is also water resource intensive  the term fossil water is sometimes used to describe aquifers whose water is not being recharged
