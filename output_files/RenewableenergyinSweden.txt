electricity  heating cooling  and transportation - by 2020.[11  eurostat reported that sweden had already exceeded the directive s 2020 target in 2014[12  reaching 52.6  of total final energy consumption provided by renewables  it was just 38.7  in 2004).[4  this makes sweden the leading country within the eu-28 group in terms of renewable energy use by share  followed by finland and latvia on 38.7   austria on 33.1  and denmark on 29.2%.[4  the two other signaturies to the directive  iceland and norway  remain ahead of sweden on 77.1  and 69.2  respectively  4   the 2014 52.6  overall share of final energy consumption in sweden breaks down as renewable energy providing the following shares to each sector  68.1  of the heating and cooling sector  63.3  of the electricity sector and 19.2  of the transport sector  13   the share of renewable electricity use is high in sweden  hydro  wind  and solar power together accounted for 49.8  of the electricity produced in the country in 2014  when measured against national electricity consumption  however  this amount rises to 55.5%).[14  since 2003  sweden has supported renewable energy in the electricity sector with a  green electricity certificate  obligation for retail power suppliers  15][16  the current plan of the certificate system is to support 25 twh of new renewable electricity generation by 2020.[17   in june 2016  the swedish center-left minority coalition government reached a cross-party energy deal with three opposition parties  the moderate party  centre party  sweden   and christian democrats  sweden    with the agreement targeting 100  renewable electricity production by 2040.[18][19   in 2013 renewable energy investment was more than us 1 billion in sweden  20   wind power accounted for 10  of the electricity generated in sweden in 2015  up from 5  in 2012 and 2.4  in 2010.[21][22][23][24   sweden has wind power potential of 510 twh a at land and 46 twh a at sea  25  consumption was 140 twh of power in 2010   in 2013 sweden was second top country for wind power capacity per inhabitant in the world  488 w per person  26  in correlation one must note that swedish use of energy per inhabitant is much higher than average in europe   sweden has a wave power station outside lysekil   hydroelectric power in sweden accounts for more than half of energy production  more than 1900 power stations operate all over the country  forty-five produce 100 mw and over  17 produce 200 mw and over  and 6 produce 400 mw and over  the largest station  which is located on the upper lule river  has a maximum production capacity of 977 mw  the lule river is also the most productive river  with almost 18  of the swedish installed effect  almost all of the medium to large plants are located in northern sweden   while installations have historically been minimal  solar power has recently been growing quickly in sweden with the country s cumulative pv capacity nearly doubling in 2014 to 79 mw  34   sweden aims for a fossil fuel free vehicle fleet by 2030.[35   sweden published the sustainability criteria for biofuels (2011  which consider the areas with high biological values to be protected in respect to fuels production  the feedstock origin used for production of bioliquids in sweden during 2011 was sweden 49  the netherlands 17  united states 17  finland 6  belgium 3  and other 8   brazil  malaysia and russia   palm oil is often pointed out as a dirty feed-stock for biofuels  none of the swedish companies used palm oil in 2011  the largest share of feedstock for bioliquids comes from the forest industry in the form of tall oil pitch  tall oil and methanol  36   in 2013 the bus fleets in more than a dozen cities relied entirely on biomethane  local plants produced more than 60  of the total biomethane used in swedish natural gas vehicles  and more filling stations were opened in 2012 and 2013  goteborg energi  gothenburg energy  has a 20 mw facility that gasifies forest residues and then converts the synthesis gases u2014hydrogen and carbon monoxide u2014into biomethane  37   nuclear is dominating in this sector  the other operational plant is  in almost all cases  fueled with renewable fuels  oil plants are few  and are either decommissioned or used as a reserve   more than 35  of the swedish electricity is produced by 10 nuclear reactors  spread out on 3 power stations   before 2005  there were 12 reactors  but the two bwr reactors (~1,2 gw  at the barseb xe4ck nuclear power plant were decommissioned in 1999 and 2005   according to energy information administration the co2 emissions from energy consumption of sweden were in 2009 54.77 mt  slightly below finland 54.86 mt  despite the difference in the population  38  the emissions per capita were in sweden 5.58 and in finland 9.93 tonnes per capita in 2009.[39
