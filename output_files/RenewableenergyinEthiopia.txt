 ethiopia generates most of its electricity from renewable energy  mainly hydropower on the blue nile  in 2011  over 96  of ethiopia s electricity was from hydropower  1  the country began a large program to expand electricity supply in the 2010s from 2,000 mw to 10,000 mw  this was to be done mainly with renewable sources  wind and geothermal were included to offset seasonal differences in water levels  ethiopia plans to export electricity to neighboring countries but transmission lines will need to be upgraded and expanded   most of the energy needs of ethiopia are filled by biofuels for cooking  heating  and off-grid lighting  petroleum  including gasoline  diesel and kerosene supply less than 7  of the countries energy supply  1  solar photovoltaics is being promoted to replace fuel-based lighting and off-grid electrical supply with a solar panel assembly plant opening in addis ababa in early 2013  the majority of the ethiopia s population live in rural areas and very few have access to electricity   ethiopia is planning for a carbon-neutral status by 2025.[2       dams built in ethiopia provided over 1,500 mw of capacity by 2010  the four largest dams were built between 2004-2010   the grand ethiopian renaissance dam will be the largest hydropower dam in africa and among the largest in the world  when completed it will be able to generate 6,000 mw  almost triple ethiopia s entire national capacity   egypt has expressed concerns that their water rights are being violated by these upstream dams but ethiopia has no water treaty with egypt   ethiopia plans 800 mw of wind power  citation needed  as the dry season is also the windy season  wind power is a good complement to hydropower  the first wind installation in the country was the 51 mw adama i wind farm  built in 2011  citation needed  the 120 mw ashegoda wind farm opened in october 2013 and was the largest wind farm in africa at that time  3  the larger 153 mw adama ii wind farm went online in may 2015  bringing ethiopia s installed wind capacity to 324mw total  4   solar photovoltaics are being promoted to replace fuel-based lighting and off-grid electrical needs  ethiopia is thought to have about 5 mw of off-grid solar  citation needed  almost all current solar power is used for telecommunications  citation needed  other uses include village well pumps  health care and school lighting  a current government initiative plans to bring solar power to 150,000 households by 2015  the first phase included 1 mw of panels  5  the first large installation of solar was a village grid of 10 kw in 1985  expanded to 30 kw in 1989  a solar panel assembly plant opened in addis ababa in early 2013 capable of making 20 mw of panel per year  6   ethiopia has one geothermal plant  the 7mw aluto langano geothermal pilot plant  this is being expanded to 70mw in 2015.[7   ethiopia is planning to build geothermal plants to offset restraints on power production by hydroplants due to seasonal water variation  american-icelandic company reykjavik geothermal has an agreement to develop a 1000 mw geothermal farm  8  the first 500 mw would be completed by 2018   a study funded by the climate and development knowledge network found that the ethiopian approach to geothermal development puts little focus on involving the private sector in risk mitigation and fails to build the capacity needed for flows of significant private sector finance  the study found that that that international  multilateral and bilateral institutions should   the majority of ethiopia s energy needs are met by biofuels  fuelwood  for cooking  the government plans to distribute 9 million more efficient stoves by 2015 to reduce wood use while improving air quality and lowering co2 emissions  2  reduced use of firewood should also help the government s goal of reforestation   as ethiopia produces more power than it consumes  it has become a regional power exporter  in 2015  it sells electricity to kenya  sudan and djibouti and has future contracts for power sales to tanzania  rwanda  south sudan and yemen  10  the eastern african power pool will expand transmission lines to make this possible  exports to egypt and sudan are possible after the completion of the grand ethiopian renaissance dam  11
