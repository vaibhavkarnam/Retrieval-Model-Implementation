Seasonalthermalenergystorage
 seasonal thermal energy storage  or stes  is the storage of heat or cold for periods of up to several months  the thermal energy can be collected whenever it is available and be used whenever needed  such as in the opposing season  for example  heat from solar collectors or waste heat from air conditioning equipment can be gathered in hot months for space heating use when needed  including during winter months  waste heat from industrial process can similarly be stored and be used much later  1  or the natural cold of winter air can be stored for summertime air conditioning  2][3  stes stores can serve district heating systems  as well as single buildings or complexes  among seasonal storages used for heating  the design peak annual temperatures generally are in the range of 27 to 80\xa0\xb0c (80.6 to 176.0\xa0\xb0f   and the temperature difference occurring in the storage over the course of a year can be several tens of degrees  some systems use a heat pump to help charge and discharge the storage during part or all of the cycle  for cooling applications  often only circulation pumps are used  a less common term for stes technologies is interseasonal thermal energy storage 4   examples for district heating include drake landing solar community where ground storage provides 97  of yearly consumption without heat pumps  5  and danish pond storage with boosting  6       there are several types of stes technology  covering a range of applications from single small buildings to community district heating networks  generally  efficiency increases and the specific construction cost decreases with size   the international energy agency s energy conservation through energy storage  eces  programme 27][28  has held triennial global energy conferences since 1981  the conferences originally focused exclusively on stes  but now that those technologies are mature other topics such as phase change materials  pcm  and electrical energy storage are also being covered  since 1985 each conference has had  stock   for storage  at the end of its name  e g  ecostock  thermastock  29  they are held at various locations around the world  most recent was innostock 2012  the 12th international conference on thermal energy storage  in lleida  spain  30  greenstock 2015 will be held in beijing  31   the iea-eces programme continues the work of the earlier international council for thermal energy storage which from 1978 to 1990 had a quarterly newsletter and was initially sponsored by the u s  department of energy  the newsletter was initially called ates newsletter  and after btes became a feasible technology it was changed to stes newsletter  32][33   small passively heated buildings typically use the soil adjoining the building as a low-temperature seasonal heat store that in the annual cycle reaches a maximum temperature similar to average annual air temperature  with the temperature drawn down for heating in colder months  such systems are a feature of building design  as some simple but significant differences from  traditional  buildings are necessary  at a depth of about 20 feet (6.1\xa0m  in the soil  the temperature is naturally stable within a year-round range  34  if the draw down does not exceed the natural capacity for solar restoration of heat  such storage systems operate within a narrow range of storage temperatures over the course of a year  as opposed to the other stes systems described above for which large annual temperature differences are intended   two basic passive solar building technologies were developed in the us during the 1970s and 1980s  they utilize direct heat conduction to and from thermally isolated  moisture-protected soil as a seasonal storage medium for space heating  with direct conduction as the heat return method  in one method   passive annual heat storage  (pahs   35  the building u2019s windows and other exterior surfaces capture solar heat which is transferred by conduction through the floors  walls  and sometimes the roof  into adjoining thermally buffered soil   when the interior spaces are cooler than the storage medium  heat is conducted back to the living space  36][37  the other method  \u201cannualized geothermal solar u201d  ags  uses a separate solar collector to capture heat  the collected heat is delivered to a storage device  soil  gravel bed or water tank  either passively by the convection of the heat transfer medium  e g  air or water  or actively by pumping it  this method is usually implemented with a capacity designed for six months of heating   a number of examples of the use of solar thermal storage from across the world include  suffolk one a college in east anglia  england that uses a thermal collector of pipe buried in the bus turning area to collect solar energy that is then stored in 18 100 metres (330\xa0ft  boreholes for use in winter heating  drake landing solar community in canada uses solar thermal collectors on the garage roofs of 52 homes  which is then stored in an array of 35 metres (115\xa0ft  deep boreholes  the ground can reach temperatures in excess of 70\xa0\xb0c which is then used to heat the houses passively  the scheme has been running successfully since 2007  in br xe6dstrup  denmark some 8,000 square metres (86,000\xa0sq xa0ft  of solar thermal collectors are used to collect some 4,000,000 kwh a similarly stored in an array of 50 metres (160\xa0ft  deep boreholes   architect matyas gutai 38  obtained an eu grant to construct a house in hungary 39  which uses extensive water filled wall panels as heat collectors and reservoirs with underground heat storage water tanks  the design uses microprocessor control   a number of homes and small apartment buildings have demonstrated combining a large internal water tank for heat storage with roof-mounted solar-thermal collectors  storage temperatures of 90\xa0\xb0c (194\xa0\xb0f  are sufficient to supply both domestic hot water and space heating  the first such house was mit solar house #1  in 1939  an eight-unit apartment building in oberburg  switzerland was built in 1989  with three tanks storing a total of 118\xa0m3 (4,167 cubic feet  that store more heat than the building requires  since 2011  that design is now being replicated in new buildings  40   in berlin  the \u201czero heating energy house u201d  was built in 1997 in as part of the iea task 13 low energy housing demonstration project  it stores water at temperatures up to 90\xa0\xb0c (194\xa0\xb0f  inside a 20\xa0m3 (706 cubic feet  tank in the basement   41   a similar example was built in ireland in 2009  as a prototype  the solar seasonal store 42  consists of a 23\xa0m3 (812\xa0cu xa0ft  tank  filled with water  43  which was installed in the ground  heavily insulated all around  to store heat from evacuated solar tubes during the year  the system was installed as an experiment to heat the world s first standardized pre-fabricated passive house 44  in galway  ireland  the aim was to find out if this heat would be sufficient to eliminate the need for any electricity in the already highly efficient home during the winter months   stes is also used extensively for the heating of greenhouses  45][46][47  ates is the kind of storage commonly in use for this application  in summer  the greenhouse is cooled with ground water  pumped from the \u201ccold well u201d in the aquifer  the water is heated in the process  and is returned to the \u201cwarm well u201d in the aquifer  when the greenhouse needs heat  such as to extend the growing season  water is withdrawn from the warm well  becomes chilled while serving its heating function  and is returned to the cold well  this is a very efficient system of free cooling  which uses only circulation pumps and no heat pumps
