Specifications
 there are different types of specifications  which generally are mostly types of documents  forms or orders or relates to information in databases  the word specification is defined as  to state explicitly or in detail  or  to be specific   a specification may refer to a type of technical standard  the main topic of this page    using a word  specification  without additional information to what kind of specification you refer to is confusing and considered bad practice within systems engineering   a requirement specification is a set of documented requirements to be satisfied by a material  design  product  or service  1   a functional specification is closely related to the requirement specification and may show functional block diagrams   a design or product specification describes the features of the solutions for the requirement specification  referring to the designed solution or final produced solution  sometimes the term specification is here used in connection with a data sheet  or spec sheet   this may be confusing  a data sheet describes the technical characteristics of an item or product as designed and or produced  it can be published by a manufacturer to help people choose products or to help use the products  a data sheet is not a technical specification as described in this article   a  in-service  or  maintained as  specification  specifies the conditions of a system or object after years of operation  including the effects of wear and maintenance  configuration changes    specifications may also refer to technical standards  which may be developed by any of various kinds of organizations  both public and private  example organization types include a corporation  a consortium  a small group of corporations   a trade association  an industry-wide group of corporations   a national government  including its military  regulatory agencies  and national laboratories and institutes   a professional association  society   a purpose-made standards organization such as iso  or vendor-neutral developed generic requirements  it is common for one organization to refer to  reference  call out  cite  the standards of another  voluntary standards may become mandatory if adopted by a government or business contract       in engineering  manufacturing  and business  it is vital for suppliers  purchasers  and users of materials  products  or services to understand and agree upon all requirements  2  a specification is a type of a standard which is often referenced by a contract or procurement document  it provides the necessary details about the specific requirements   specifications may be written by government agencies  standards organizations  astm  iso  cen  dod  etc    trade associations  corporations  and others   a product specification does not necessarily prove a product to be correct or useful  an item might be verified to comply with a specification or stamped with a specification number  this does not  by itself  indicate that the item is fit for any particular use  the people who use the item  engineers  trade unions  etc   or specify the item  building codes  government  industry  etc   have the responsibility to consider the choice of available specifications  specify the correct one  enforce compliance  and use the item correctly  validation of suitability is necessary   sometimes a guide or a standard operating procedure is available to help write and format a good specification  3][4][5  a specification might include   specifications in north america form part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of building  and infrastructure projects  specifications describe the quality and performance of building materials  using code citations and published standards  whereas the drawings or building information model  bim  illustrates quantity and location of materials  the guiding master document of names and numbers is the latest edition of masterformat  this is a consensus document that is jointly sponsored by two professional organizations  construction specifications canada and construction specifications institute based in the united states and updated every two years   while there is a tendency to believe that  specifications overrule drawings  in the event of discrepancies between the text document and the drawings  the actual intent must be made explicit in the contract between the owner and the contractor  the standard aia  american institute of architects  and ejcdc  engineering joint contract documents committee  states that the drawings and specifications are complementary  together providing the information required for a complete facility  many public agencies  such as the naval facilities command  navfac  state that the specifications overrule the drawings  this is based on the idea that words are easier for a jury  or mediator  to interpret than drawings in case of a dispute   the standard listing of construction specifications falls into 50 divisions  or broad categories of work types and work results involved in construction  the divisions are subdivided into sections  each one addressing a specific material type  concrete  or a work product  steel door  of the construction work  a specific material may be covered in several locations  depending on the work result  stainless steel  for example  can be covered as a sheet material used in flashing and sheet metal in division 07  it can be part of a finished product  such as a handrail  covered in division 05  or it can be a component of building hardware  covered in division 08  the original listing of specification divisions was based on the time sequence of construction  working from exterior to interior  and this logic is still somewhat followed as new materials and systems make their way into the construction process   each section is subdivided into three distinct parts   general    products  and  execution   the masterformat and section format [13 system can be successfully applied to residential  commercial  civil  and industrial construction  although many architects find the rather voluminous commercial style of specifications too lengthy for most residential projects and therefore either produce more abbreviated specifications of their own or use archspec  which was specifically created for residential projects   master specification systems are available from multiple vendors such as arcom  visispec  bsd  and spectext  these systems were created to standardize language across the united states and are usually subscription based   specifications can be either  performance-based   whereby the specifier restricts the text to stating the performance that must be achieved by the completed work   prescriptive  where the specifier states the specific criteria such as fabrication standards applicable to the item  or  proprietary  whereby the specifier indicates specific products  vendors and even contractors that are acceptable for each workscope  in addition  specifications can be  closed  with a specific list of products  or  open  allowing for substitutions made by the contractor  most construction specifications are a combination of performance-based and proprietrary types  naming acceptable manufacturers and products while also specifying certain standards and design criteria that must be met   while north american specifications are usually restricted to broad descriptions of the work  european ones and civil work can include actual work quantities  including such things as area of drywall to be built in square meters  like a bill of materials  this type of specification is a collaborative effort between a specwriter and a quantity surveyor  this approach is unusual in north america  where each bidder performs a quantity survey on the basis of both drawings and specifications  in many countries on the european continent  content that might be described as  specifications  in the united states are covered under the building code or municipal code  civil and infrastructure work in the united states often includes a quantity breakdown of the work to be performed as well   although specifications are usually issued by the architect s office  specification writing itself is undertaken by the architect and the various engineers or by specialist specification writers  specification writing is often a distinct professional trade  with professional certifications such as  certified construction specifier   ccs  available through the construction specifications institute and the registered specification writer (rsw  14  through construction specifications canada  specification writers are either employees of or sub-contractors to architects  engineers  or construction management companies  specification writers frequently meet with manufacturers of building materials who seek to have their products specified on upcoming construction projects so that contractors can include their products in the estimates leading to their proposals   in february 2015  archspec went live  from arch  architects creating homes   a nationwide american professional society of architects whose purpose is to improve residential architecture  archspec was created specifically for use by licensed architects while designing sfr  single family residential  architectural projects  unlike the more commercial csi (50  division commercial specifications   archspec utilizes the more recognizable 16 traditional divisions  plus a division 0  scope  amp  bid forms  and division 17  low voltage   many architects  up to this point  did not provide specifications for residential designs  which is one of the reasons archspec was created  to fill a void in the industry with more compact specifications for residential use  shorter form specifications documents suitable for residential use are also available through arcom  and follow the 50 division format  which was adopted in both the united states and canada starting in 2004  the 16 division format is no longer considered standard  and is not supported by either csi or csc  or any of the subscription master specification services  data repositories  product lead systems  and the bulk of governmental agencies   specifications in the uk are part of the contract documents that accompany and govern the construction of a building  they are prepared by construction professionals such as architects  architectural technologists  structural engineers  landscape architects and building services engineers  they are created from previous project specifications  in-house documents or master specifications such as the national building specification  nbs   the national building specification is owned by the royal institute of british architects  riba  through their commercial group riba enterprises  ribae   nbs master specifications provide content that is broad and comprehensive  and delivered using software functionality that enables specifiers to customize the content to suit the needs of the project and to keep up to date  uk project specification types fall into two main categories prescriptive and performance  prescriptive specifications define the requirements using generic or proprietary descriptions of what is required  whereas performance specifications focus on the outcomes rather than the characteristics of the components  specifications are an integral part of building information modeling and cover the non-geometric requirements   egypt xa0  specifications are part of contract documents  the housing and building national research center  hbrc  is responsible for developing construction specifications and codes  the hbrc had published more than 15 books which cover building activities like  earthworks - plastering - etc    pharmaceutical products can usually be tested and qualified by various pharmacopoeia  current existing pronounced standards include   if any pharmaceutical product is not covered by the above standards  it can be evaluated by the additional source of pharmacopoeia from other nations  from industrial specifications  or from a standardized formulary such as  a similar approach is adopted by the food manufacturing  of which codex alimentarius ranks the highest standards  followed by regional and national standards  15   the coverage of food and drug standards by iso is currently less fruitful and not yet put forward as an urgent agenda due to the tight restrictions of regional or national constitution 16][17   specifications and other standards can be externally imposed as discussed above  but also internal manufacturing and quality specifications  these exist not only for the food or pharmaceutical product but also for the processing machinery  quality processes  packaging  logistics  cold chain   etc  and are exemplified by iso 14134 and iso 15609[18][19   the converse of explicit statement of specifications is a process for dealing with observations that are out-of-specification  the united states food and drug administration has published a non-binding recommendation that addresses just this point  20   at the present time  much of the information and regulations concerning food and food products remain in a form which makes it difficult to apply automated information processing  storage and transmission methods and techniques   data systems that can process  store and transfer information about food and food products need formal specifications for the representations of data about food and food products in order to operate effectively and efficiently   development of formal specifications for food and drug data with the necessary and sufficient clarity and precision for use specifically by digital computing systems have begun to emerge from government agencies and standards organizations   the united states food and drug administration has published specifications for a  structured product label  which drug manufacturers must by mandate use to submit electronically the information on a drug label  21   recently  iso has made some progress in the area of food and drug standards and formal specifications for data about regulated substances through the publication of iso 11238[22   specifications are needed to avoid errors due to lack of compatibility  for instance  in interoperability issues   for instance  when two applications share unicode data  but use different normal forms or use them incorrectly  in an incompatible way or without sharing a minimum set of interoperability specification  errors and data loss can result  for example  mac os x has many components that prefer or require only decomposed characters  thus decomposed-only unicode encoded with utf-8 is also known as "utf8-mac    in one specific instance  the combination of os x errors handling composed characters  and the samba file- and printer-sharing software  which replaces decomposed letters with composed ones when copying file names   has led to confusing and data-destroying interoperability problems  23][24   applications may avoid such errors by preserving input code points  and only normalizing them to the application s preferred normal form for internal use   such errors may also be avoided with algorithms normalizing both strings before any binary comparison   however errors due to file name encoding incompatibilities have always existed  due to a lack of minimum set of common specification between software hoped to be inter-operable between various file system drivers  operating systems  network protocols  and thousands of software packages   a formal specification is a mathematical description of software or hardware that may be used to develop an implementation  it describes what the system should do  not  necessarily  how the system should do it  given such a specification  it is possible to use formal verification techniques to demonstrate that a candidate system design is correct with respect to that specification  this has the advantage that incorrect candidate system designs can be revised before a major investment has been made in actually implementing the design  an alternative approach is to use provably correct refinement steps to transform a specification into a design  and ultimately into an actual implementation  that is correct by construction   in  hardware  software  or enterprise  systems development  an architectural specification is the set of documentation that describes the structure  behavior  and more views of that system   a program specification is the definition of what a computer program is expected to do  it can be informal  in which case it can be considered as a user manual from a developer point of view  or formal  in which case it has a definite meaning defined in mathematical or programmatic terms  in practice  many successful specifications are written to understand and fine-tune applications that were already well-developed  although safety-critical software systems are often carefully specified prior to application development  specifications are most important for external interfaces that must remain stable   in software development  a functional specification  also  functional spec or specs or functional specifications document  fsd   is the set of documentation that describes the behavior of a computer program or larger software system  the documentation typically describes various inputs that can be provided to the software system and how the system responds to those inputs   web services specifications are often under the umbrella of a quality management system  25   these types of documents define how a specific document should be written  which may include  but is not limited to  the systems of a document naming  version  layout  referencing  structuring  appearance  language  copyright  hierarchy or format  etc  26][27  very often  this kind of specifications is complemented by a designated template  28][29][30
