Performanceperwatt
 in computing  performance per watt is a measure of the energy efficiency of a particular computer architecture or computer hardware  literally  it measures the rate of computation that can be delivered by a computer for every watt of power consumed  performance  unlike watt  isn t an objective thing  it depends on what the computer is working on  but the green500 list ranks the most efficient computers  according to one benchmark   system designers building parallel computers  such as google s hardware  pick cpus based on their  other than green500  performance per watt of power  because the cost of powering the cpu outweighs the cost of the cpu itself  1       the performance and power consumption metrics used depend on the definition  reasonable measures of performance are flops  mips  or the score for any performance benchmark  several measures of power usage may be employed  depending on the purposes of the metric  for example  a metric might only consider the electrical power delivered to a machine directly  while another might include all power necessary to run a computer  such as cooling and monitoring systems  the power measurement is often the average power used while running the benchmark  but other measures of power usage may be employed  e g  peak power  idle power    for example  the early univac i computer performed approximately 0.015 operations per watt-second  performing 1,905 operations per second  ops   while consuming 125\xa0kw   the fujitsu fr-v vliw vector processor system on a chip in the 4 fr550 core variant released 2005 performs 51 giga-ops with 3 watts of power consumption resulting in 17 billion operations per watt-second  2][3  this is an improvement by over a trillion times in 54 years   most of the power a computer uses is converted into heat  so a system that takes fewer watts to do a job will require less cooling to maintain a given operating temperature  reduced cooling demands makes it easier to quiet a computer  lower energy consumption can also make it less costly to run  and reduce the environmental impact of powering the computer  see green computing   if installed where there is limited climate control  a lower power computer will operate at a lower temperature  which may make it more reliable  in a climate controlled environment  reductions in direct power use may also create savings in climate control energy   computing energy consumption is sometimes also measured by reporting the energy required to run a particular benchmark  for instance eembc energybench  energy consumption figures for a standard workload may make it easier to judge the effect of an improvement in energy efficiency   performance  in operations second  per watt can also be written as operations watt-second  or operations joule  since 1 watt   1 joule second     flops  floating point operations per second  per watt is a common measure  like the flops it is based on  the metric is usually applied to scientific computing and simulations involving many floating point calculations   as of june 2016 update   the green500 list rates the two most efficient supercomputers highest

terms of energy efficiency  typically measured as linpack flops per watt  16][17   as of august 2015 update   the shoubu supercomputer of riken outside tokyo japan tops the green500 list with 7032 mflops w  the top three supercomputers of the list use pezy-sc accelerators  gpu-like that use opencl  18  by pezy computing with 1024 cores each and 6-7 gflops w efficiency  19][20   as of november

units  gpu  have continued to increase in energy usage  while cpus designers have recently focused on improving performance per watt  high performance gpus may draw large amount of power and hence  intelligent techniques are required to manage gpu power consumption  26  measures like 3dmark2006 score per watt can help identify more efficient gpus  27  however that may not adequately incorporate efficiency in typical use  where much time is spent doing less demanding tasks  28   with modern gpus  energy usage is an important constraint on the maximum computational capabilities that can be achieved  gpu designs are usually highly scalable  allowing the manufacturer to put multiple chips on the same video card  or to use multiple video cards that work in parallel  peak performance of any system is essentially limited by the amount of power it can draw and the amount of heat it can dissipate  consequently  performance per watt of a gpu design translates directly into peak performance of a system that uses that design   since gpus may also be used for some general purpose computation  sometimes their performance is measured in terms also applied to cpus  such as flops per watt   while performance per watt is useful  absolute power requirements are also important  claims of improved performance per watt may be used to mask increasing power demands  for instance  though newer generation gpu architectures may provide better performance per watt  continued performance increases can negate the gains in efficiency  and the gpus continue to consume large amounts of power  29   benchmarks that measure power under heavy load may not adequately reflect typical efficiency  for instance  3dmark stresses the 3d performance of a gpu  but many computers spend most of their time doing less intense display tasks  idle  2d tasks  displaying video   so the 2d or idle efficiency of the graphics system may be at least as significant for overall energy efficiency  likewise  systems that spend much of their time in standby or soft off are not adequately characterized by just efficiency under load  to help address this some benchmarks  like specpower  include measurements at a series of load levels  30   the efficiency of some electrical components  such as voltage regulators  decreases with increasing temperature  so the power used may increase with temperature  power supplies  motherboards  and some video cards are some of the subsystems affected by this  so their power draw may depend on temperature  and the temperature or temperature dependence should be noted when measuring  31][32   performance per watt also typically does not include full life-cycle costs  since computer manufacturing is energy intensive  and computers often have a relatively short lifespan  energy and materials involved in production  distribution  disposal and recycling often make up significant portions of their cost  energy use  and environmental impact  33][34   energy required for climate control of the computer s surroundings is often not counted in the wattage calculation  but it can be significant  35   swap  space  wattage and performance  is a sun microsystems
