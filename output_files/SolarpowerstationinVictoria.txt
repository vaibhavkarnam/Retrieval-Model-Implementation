 the mildura solar concentrator power station is a proposed 100\xa0megawatt  mw  concentrated photovoltaic  cpv  solar pv system to be built at carwarp  near mildura  victoria  australia  1  it was proposed by solar systems  2  which was acquired by silex systems in 2010  a 1.5\xa0mw demonstration plant was commissioned in april 2013  construction of the larger facility was expected to commence in 2014 and be completed in 2017.[3][4   the expansion plan was abandoned in august 2014 due to a number of factors  these included low wholesale electricity prices  a lack of commitment to clean energy by the australian government and uncertainty surrounding the renewable energy target  ret  in australia  5][6       the project to build a 154\xa0mw solar plant was announced in 2006 and expected to be completed in 2013.[7][8  it was delayed after solar systems went into administration as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis  4  the demonstration plant was completed in 2013   the "cs500  dish concentrator pv unit design has 112 curved reflecting mirrors  which track the sun throughout the day  the combination of mirror profile  mounting framework  and solar receiver will deliver concentrated solar energy to each pv module  the tracking mechanism allows electricity to be produced during the day whenever the sun is more than 5\xb0 above the horizon  direct current electricity from the receivers is passed through a solar inverter that produces grid-quality alternating current  transformers step up the voltage to the requirement of the local network at the point of connection  advantages claimed for this design include  9   the commercialisation of this technology has already seen four smaller solar power stations established in central australia  with support from the australian greenhouse office  11
