RenewableenergyinKenya
 the renewable energy sector in kenya is among the most active in africa  in kenya  investment grew from virtually zero in 2009 to us 1.3 billion in 2010 across technologies such as wind  geothermal  small-scale hydro and biofuels  this is not saying that kenya was never active in the renewable energy sector  kenya is africa s first geothermal power producer 1  and the world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita  it is still the largest producer of geothermal power in africa today at 200 mw [2  with only one other african country producing geothermal power  ethiopia  connectivity to the national grid in kenya currently stands at 28   in 2011  kenya was also the first country in africa to open a carbon exchange  3       currently geothermal energy accounts for 20  of total installed capacity of the kenyan grid  kenya is the first african country to tap geothermal power and the largest producer of geo-energy  harnessing power from steam released by hot rocks beneath the rift valley  the abundant sun and wind are also being harnessed in a variety of projects  of these  the lake turkana project is the most audacious  both because of the scale and the location  4  kenya has the capacity to produce 10 gw of geothermal energy  5   geothermal has a prominent place in kenya u2019s overarching development plans  these include the vision 2030  the national climate change action plan  nccap   and the current \u20185000  mw in 40 months initiative u2019  geothermal power has the potential to provide reliable  cost-competitive  baseload power with a small carbon footprint  and reduces vulnerability to climate by diversifying power supply away from hydropower  which currently provides the majority of kenya u2019s electricity  kenya has set out ambitious targets for geothermal energy  it aims to expand its geothermal power production capacity to 5,000 mw by 2030  with a medium-term target of installing 1,887 mw by 2017  as of october 2014  kenya has an installed geothermal capacity of approximately 340 mw  although there is significant political will and ambition  reaching these ambitions is a major challenge [6   hydro power accounts for 49.7  of kenya s energy needs     energy portal kenya  source  1   kenyans are a world leader in the number of solar power systems installed per capita  more kenyans are turning to solar power rather than connections to the country u2019s electric grid  this is due to relatively high connectivity costs to the grid and the abundance of solar power in kenya  7   kenya has several notable solar power distributors including m-kopa with locally adopted payment schemes including pay-as-you-go and microfinance  8  the world bank and international finance corporation  ifc  have partnered as part of a lighting africa initiative  9  western companies have also helped sponsor efforts to introduce decentralized solar power solutions in the country  10][11   kenya aims to produce 19,200 mw against a demand of 15,000 mw by 2030  all this is shown in the table below
