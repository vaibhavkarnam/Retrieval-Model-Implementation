EUEnergyEfficiencyDirective201227EU
 the energy efficiency directive 2012/27 eu  abbreviated eed  is a european union directive which mandates energy efficiency improvements within the european union  1  it was approved on 25\xa0october 2012 and entered into force on 4\xa0december 2012.[2]:2 the directive introduces legally binding measures to encourage efforts to use energy more efficiently in all stages and sectors of the supply chain  it establishes a common framework for the promotion of energy efficiency within the eu in order to meet its energy efficiency headline target of 20  by 2020  it also paves the way for further improvements thereafter  3   the directive provides for the establishment of indicative national energy efficiency targets for 2020  member states were to have submitted their national energy efficiency action plans  neeap  by 30\xa0april 2014  outlining the measures they have implemented to improve energy efficiency and their expected and or achieved energy savings  in addition  member states are required to report annually on progress toward their national targets  the policy requirements in the directive are minimum obligations and member states may introduce more stringent measures  3   the energy efficiency directive 2012/27 eu was preceded by the energy services directive 2006/32/ec  4][5  this earlier directive contained a target of a 9  reduction in energy usage within 9\xa0years of the directive coming into force  the earlier directive also required eu members to submit national energy efficiency action plans  with the first plan to be lodged by 30\xa0june 2007   on 23\xa0july 2014 the european commission announced a new target of a 30  improvement in energy efficiency by 2030.[6       documents leaked in mid-2012 show that the united kingdom repeatedly fought to water down key measures during the development of the directive and forced some measures to become voluntary rather than mandatory  7  as a result  a new version of the directive allows member states to set their own energy efficiency targets  instead of the original requirement of a mandatory eu-wide target of 20  improvement  8   the directive promotes rules to remove barriers in energy markets and to overcome market failures that may impede the uptake of energy efficiency  under the directive  the public sector is to play an exemplary role and consumers will have a right to know how much energy they consume  3   the following categories are covered by the directive  3   individual national energy efficiency action plans  neeap  for 2014 and annual reports for 2016 are available for download  4  some national action plans have wikipedia articles as well   a 2014 study finds that  despite the directive being technically complex and lacking binding targets  it is an improvement over earlier european union policy on energy efficiency  notwithstanding  the document is weakened by the number of exemptions and the number of passages it contains requiring interpretation  the process of implementation is also subject to problems  9]:3\u20134  a 2016 study examines the treatment of article xa07 of the directive u202f 1]:15 by each of the 28 member states  titled energy efficiency obligation schemes  this key article requires that countries  implement energy efficiency obligations and or alternative policy instruments in order to reach a reduction in final energy use of 1.5  per year   10]:1 to fulfill this requirement  the member states have proposed very different policy measures and adopted very different calculation methods and monitoring and verification schemes  the study analyses each national action plan and estimates whether the projected savings are likely to materialise and whether these will be sufficient to meet the article xa07 target  10
