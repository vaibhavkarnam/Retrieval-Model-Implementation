Electricpowerquality
 electric power quality  or simply power quality  involves voltage  frequency  and waveform  good power quality can be defined as a steady supply voltage that stays within the prescribed range  steady a c  frequency close to the rated value  and smooth voltage curve waveform  resembles a sine wave   in general  it is useful to consider power quality as the compatibility between what comes out of an electric outlet and the load that is plugged into it  1  the term is used to describe electric power that drives an electrical load and the load s ability to function properly  without the proper power  an electrical device  or load  may malfunction  fail prematurely or not operate at all  there are many ways in which electric power can be of poor quality and many more causes of such poor quality power   the electric power industry comprises electricity generation  ac power   electric power transmission and ultimately electric power distribution to an electricity meter located at the premises of the end user of the electric power  the electricity then moves through the wiring system of the end user until it reaches the load  the complexity of the system to move electric energy from the point of production to the point of consumption combined with variations in weather  generation  demand and other factors provide many opportunities for the quality of supply to be compromised   while  power quality  is a convenient term for many  it is the quality of the voltage u2014rather than power or electric current u2014that is actually described by the term  power is simply the flow of energy and the current demanded by a load is largely uncontrollable       the quality of electrical power may be described as a set of values of parameters  such as   it is often useful to think of power quality as a compatibility problem  is the equipment connected to the grid compatible with the events on the grid  and is the power delivered by the grid  including the events  compatible with the equipment that is connected  compatibility problems always have at least two solutions  in this case  either clean up the power  or make the equipment tougher   the tolerance of data-processing equipment to voltage variations is often characterized by the cbema curve  which give the duration and magnitude of voltage variations that can be tolerated  3   ideally  ac voltage is supplied by a utility as sinusoidal having an amplitude and frequency given by national standards  in the case of mains  or system specifications  in the case of a power feed not directly attached to the mains  with an impedance of zero ohms at all frequencies   no real-life power source is ideal and generally can deviate in at least the following ways   each of these power quality problems has a different cause  some problems are a result of the shared infrastructure  for example  a fault on the network may cause a dip that will affect some customers  the higher the level of the fault  the greater the number affected  a problem on one customer u2019s site may cause a transient that affects all other customers on the same subsystem  problems  such as harmonics  arise within the customer u2019s own installation and may propagate onto the network and affect other customers  harmonic problems can be dealt with by a combination of good design practice and well proven reduction equipment   power conditioning is modifying the power to improve its quality   an uninterruptible power supply can be used to switch off of mains power if there is a transient  temporary  condition on the line  however  cheaper ups units create poor-quality power themselves  akin to imposing a higher-frequency and lower-amplitude square wave atop the sine wave  high-quality ups units utilize a double conversion topology which breaks down incoming ac power into dc  charges the batteries  then remanufactures an ac sine wave  this remanufactured sine wave is of higher quality than the original ac power feed  6   a surge protector or simple capacitor or varistor can protect against most overvoltage conditions  while a lightning arrester protects against severe spikes   electronic filters can remove harmonics   modern systems use sensors called phasor measurement units  pmu  distributed throughout their network to monitor power quality and in some cases respond automatically to them  using such smart grids features of rapid sensing and automated self healing of anomalies in the network promises to bring higher quality power and less downtime while simultaneously supporting power from intermittent power sources and distributed generation  which would if unchecked degrade power quality   a power quality compression algorithm is an algorithm used in the analysis of power quality  to provide high quality electric power service  it is essential to monitor the quality of the electric signals also termed as power quality  pq  at different locations along an electrical power network  electrical utilities carefully monitor waveforms and currents at various network locations constantly  to understand what lead up to any unforeseen events such as a power outage and blackouts  this is particularly critical at sites where the environment and public safety are at risk  institutions such as hospitals  sewage treatment plants  mines  etc     engineers have at their disposal many meters  7  that are able to read and display electrical power waveforms and calculating parameters of the waveforms  these parameters may include  for example  current and voltage rms  phase relationship between waveforms of a multi-phase signal  power factor  frequency  thd  active power  kw   reactive power  kvar   apparent power  kva  and active energy  kwh   reactive energy  kvarh  and apparent energy  kvah  and many more  in order to sufficiently monitor unforeseen events  ribeiro et al  8  explains that it is not enough to display these parameters  but to also capture voltage waveform data at all times  this is impracticable due to the large amount of data involved  causing what is known the \u201cbottle effect u201d  for instance  at a sampling rate of 32 samples per cycle  1,920 samples are collected per second  for three-phase meters that measure both voltage and current waveforms  the data is 6-8 times as much  more practical solutions developed in recent years store data only when an event occurs  for example  when high levels of power system harmonics are detected  or alternatively to store the rms value of the electrical signals  9  this data  however  is not always sufficient to determine the exact nature of problems   nisenblat et al  10  proposes the idea of power quality compression algorithm  similar to lossy compression methods  that enables meters to continuously store the waveform of one or more power signals  regardless whether or not an event of interest was identified  this algorithm referred to as pqzip empowers a processor with a memory that is sufficient to store the waveform  under normal power conditions  over a long period of time  of at least a month  two months or even a year  the compression is performed in real time  as the signals are acquired  it calculates a compression decision before all the compressed data is received  for instance should one parameter remain constant  and various others fluctuate  the compression decision retains only what is relevant from the constant data  and retains all the fluctuation data  it then decomposes the waveform of the power signal of numerous components  over various periods of the waveform  it concludes the process by compressing the values of at least some of these components over different periods  separately  this real time compression algorithm  performed independent of the sampling  prevents data gaps and has a typical 1000:1 compression ratio   a typical function of a power analyzer is generation of data archive aggregated over given interval  most typically 10 minute or 1 minute interval is used as specified by the iec ieee pq standards  a significant archive sizes are created during an operation of such instrument  as kraus et al  11  have demonstrated the compression ratio on such archives using lempel u2013ziv u2013markov chain algorithm  bzip or other similar lossless compression algorithms can be significant  by using prediction and modeling on the stored time series in the actual power quality archive the efficiency of post processing compression is usually further improved  this combination of simplistic techniques implies savings in both data storage and data acquisition processes
