Uranium
 uranium is a chemical element with symbol u and atomic number xa092  it is a silvery-white metal in the actinide series of the periodic table  a uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons  of which 6 are valence electrons  uranium is weakly radioactive because all its isotopes are unstable  with half-lives of the six naturally known isotopes  uranium-233 to uranium-238  varying between 69 years and 4.5 billion years   the most common isotopes in natural uranium are uranium-238  which has 146 neutrons and accounts for over 99   and uranium-235  which has 143 neutrons   uranium has the highest atomic weight of the primordially occurring elements  its density is about 70  higher than that of lead  and slightly lower than that of gold or tungsten  it occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few parts per million in soil  rock and water  and is commercially extracted from uranium-bearing minerals such as uraninite   in nature  uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2739\u201399.2752    uranium-235 (0.7198\u20130.7202    and a very small amount of uranium-234 (0.0050\u20130.0059%).[4  uranium decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle  the half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years  5  making them useful in dating the age of the earth   many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties  uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring fissile isotope  which makes it widely used in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons  however  because of the tiny amounts found in nature  uranium needs to undergo enrichment so that enough uranium-235 is present  uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons  and is fertile  meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor  another fissile isotope  uranium-233  can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology  uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons  uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons  in sufficient concentration  these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction  this generates the heat in nuclear power reactors  and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons  depleted uranium (238u  is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating  6  uranium is used as a colorant in uranium glass  producing lemon yellow to green colors  uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light  it was also used for tinting and shading in early photography   the 1789 discovery of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to martin heinrich klaproth  who named the new element after the planet uranus  eug xe8ne-melchior p xe9ligot was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by henri becquerel  research by otto hahn  lise meitner  enrico fermi and others  such as j  robert oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in little boy  the first nuclear weapon used in war  an ensuing arms race during the cold war between the united states and the soviet union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239  the security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the soviet union in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety  7  see nuclear proliferation       when refined  uranium is a silvery white  weakly radioactive metal  it has a mohs hardness of 6  sufficient to scratch glass and approximately equal to that of titanium  rhodium  manganese and niobium  it is malleable  ductile  slightly paramagnetic  strongly electropositive and a poor electrical conductor  8][9  uranium metal has a very high density of 19.1\xa0g cm3,[10  denser than lead (11.3\xa0g cm3),[11  but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold (19.3\xa0g cm3).[12][13   uranium metal reacts with almost all non-metal elements  with the exception of the noble gases  and their compounds  with reactivity increasing with temperature  14  hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium  but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly  8  when finely divided  it can react with cold water  in air  uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide  9  uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry   uranium-235 was the first isotope that was found to be fissile  other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable  but not fissile  on bombardment with slow neutrons  its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei  releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons  if too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei  a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or  in special circumstances  an explosion  in a nuclear reactor  such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison  absorbing some of the free neutrons  such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods  see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control    as little as 15\xa0lb (7\xa0kg  of uranium-235 can be used to make an atomic bomb  15  the first nuclear bomb used in war  little boy  relied on uranium fission  but the very first nuclear explosive  the gadget used at trinity  and the bomb that destroyed nagasaki  fat man  were both plutonium bombs   uranium metal has three allotropic forms  16   the major application of uranium in the military sector is in high-density penetrators  this ammunition consists of depleted uranium  du  alloyed with 1\u20132  other elements  such as titanium or molybdenum  18  at high impact speed  the density  hardness  and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets  tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates  the use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after the use of such munitions by the us  uk and other countries during wars in the persian gulf and the balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil  see gulf war syndrome   15   depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials  while the metal itself is radioactive  its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium  8  other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces  as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material  9  due to its high density  this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses  9  depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost  19  the main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity  uranium being only a weak alpha emitter    during the later stages of world war ii  the entire cold war  and to a lesser extent afterwards  uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons  initially  two major types of fission bombs were built  a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238  later  a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission fusion bomb  thermonuclear weapon  was built  that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion  such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile  unenriched  uranium case  and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process  20   the main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel nuclear power plants  one kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about 20\xa0terajoules of energy (2\xd71013\xa0joules   assuming complete fission  as much energy as 1500 tonnes of coal  6   commercial nuclear power plants use fuel that is typically enriched to around 3  uranium-235.[6  the candu and magnox designs are the only commercial reactors capable of using unenriched uranium fuel  fuel used for united states navy reactors is typically highly enriched in uranium-235  the exact values are classified   in a breeder reactor  uranium-238 can also be converted into plutonium through the following reaction  9   before  and  occasionally  after  the discovery of radioactivity  uranium was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery glazes  such as uranium glass and in fiestaware  21   the discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore  pitchblende  by marie curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium  which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials  22  this left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product  since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium  this waste product was diverted to the glazing industry  making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant  besides the pottery glazes  uranium tile glazes accounted for the bulk of the use  including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green  yellow  mauve  black  blue  red and other colors   uranium was also used in photographic chemicals  especially uranium nitrate as a toner   9  in lamp filaments for stage lighting bulbs  23  to improve the appearance of dentures  24  and in the leather and wood industries for stains and dyes  uranium salts are mordants of silk or wool  uranyl acetate and uranyl formate are used as electron-dense  stains  in transmission electron microscopy  to increase the contrast of biological specimens in ultrathin sections and in negative staining of viruses  isolated cell organelles and macromolecules   the discovery of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element  the long half-life of the isotope uranium-238 (4.51\xd7109 years  makes it well-suited for use in estimating the age of the earliest igneous rocks and for other types of radiometric dating  including uranium-thorium dating  uranium-lead dating and uranium-uranium dating  uranium metal is used for x-ray targets in the making of high-energy x-rays  9   the use of uranium in its natural oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 ce  when it was used to add a yellow color to ceramic glazes  9  yellow glass with 1  uranium oxide was found in a roman villa on cape posillipo in the bay of naples  italy  by r  t  gunther of the university of oxford in 1912.[25  starting in the late middle ages  pitchblende was extracted from the habsburg silver mines in joachimsthal  bohemia  now j xe1chymov in the czech republic   and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry  26  in the early 19th century  the world s only known sources of uranium ore were these mines   the discovery of the element is credited to the german chemist martin heinrich klaproth  while he was working in his experimental laboratory in berlin in 1789  klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound  likely sodium diuranate  by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide  26  klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet-undiscovered element and heated it with charcoal to obtain a black powder  which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself  in fact  that powder was an oxide of uranium   26][27  he named the newly discovered element after the planet uranus  named after the primordial greek god of the sky   which had been discovered eight years earlier by william herschel  28   in 1841  eug xe8ne-melchior p xe9ligot  professor of analytical chemistry at the conservatoire national des arts et m xe9tiers  central school of arts and manufactures  in paris  isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating uranium tetrachloride with potassium  26][29   henri becquerel discovered radioactivity by using uranium in 1896.[14  becquerel made the discovery in paris by leaving a sample of a uranium salt  k2uo2(so4)2  potassium uranyl sulfate   on top of an unexposed photographic plate in a drawer and noting that the plate had become "fogged   30  he determined that a form of invisible light or rays emitted by uranium had exposed the plate   a team led by enrico fermi in 1934 observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of beta rays  electrons or positrons from the elements produced  see beta particle   31  the fission products were at first mistaken for new elements of atomic numbers 93 and 94  which the dean of the faculty of rome  orso mario corbino  christened ausonium and hesperium  respectively  32][33][34][35  the experiments leading to the discovery of uranium s ability to fission  break apart  into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by otto hahn and fritz strassmann 31  in hahn s laboratory in berlin  lise meitner and her nephew  the physicist otto robert frisch  published the physical explanation in february 1939 and named the process  nuclear fission   36  soon after  fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction  confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939  and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-235.[31  fermi urged alfred o c  nier to separate uranium isotopes for determination of the fissile component  and on february 29  1940  nier used an instrument he built at the university of minnesota to separate the world s first u-235 isotope sample  in the tate laboratory  after mailed to columbia university s cyclotron  john dunning confirmed the sample to be the isolated fissile material on march 1.[37  further work found that the far more common uranium-238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium  which  like uranium-235  is also fissile by thermal neutrons  these discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power   on 2 december 1942  as part of the manhattan project  another team led by enrico fermi was able to initiate the first artificial self-sustained nuclear chain reaction  chicago pile-1  an initial plan using enriched u-235 was abandoned as it was as yet unavailable in sufficient quantities  38  working in a lab below the stands of stagg field at the university of chicago  the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400\xa0short tons (360\xa0metric tons  of graphite  58\xa0short tons (53\xa0metric tons  of uranium oxide  and six short tons (5.5 metric tons  of uranium metal  a majority of which was supplied by westinghouse lamp plant in a makeshift production process  31][39   two major types of atomic bombs were developed by the united states during world war ii  a uranium-based device  codenamed  little boy   whose fissile material was highly enriched uranium  and a plutonium-based device  see trinity test and  fat man   whose plutonium was derived from uranium-238  the uranium-based little boy device became the first nuclear weapon used in war when it was detonated over the japanese city of hiroshima on 6 august 1945  exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500\xa0tonnes of tnt  the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings and killed approximately 75,000 people  see atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki   30  initially it was believed that uranium was relatively rare  and that nuclear proliferation could be avoided by simply buying up all known uranium stocks  but within a decade large deposits of it were discovered in many places around the world  40   the x-10 graphite reactor at oak ridge national laboratory  ornl  in oak ridge  tennessee  formerly known as the clinton pile and x-10 pile  was the world s second artificial nuclear reactor  after enrico fermi s chicago pile  and was the first reactor designed and built for continuous operation  argonne national laboratory s experimental breeder reactor i  located at the atomic energy commission s national reactor testing station near arco  idaho  became the first nuclear reactor to create electricity on 20 december 1951.[41  initially  four 150-watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor  but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility  later  the town of arco became the first in the world to have all its electricity come from nuclear power generated by borax-iii  another reactor designed and operated by argonne national laboratory   42][43  the world s first commercial scale nuclear power station  obninsk in the soviet union  began generation with its reactor am-1 on 27 june 1954  other early nuclear power plants were calder hall in england  which began generation on 17 october 1956,[44  and the shippingport atomic power station in pennsylvania  which began on 26 may 1958  nuclear power was used for the first time for propulsion by a submarine  the uss nautilus  in 1954.[31][45   in 1972  the french physicist francis perrin discovered fifteen ancient and no longer active natural nuclear fission reactors in three separate ore deposits at the oklo mine in gabon  west africa  collectively known as the oklo fossil reactors  the ore deposit is 1.7 billion years old  then  uranium-235 constituted about 3  of the total uranium on earth  46  this is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur  provided other supporting conditions exist  the capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the nuclear waste products has been cited by the u s  federal government as supporting evidence for the feasibility to store spent nuclear fuel at the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository  46   above-ground nuclear tests by the soviet union and the united states in the 1950s and early 1960s and by france into the 1970s and 1980s 19  spread a significant amount of fallout from uranium daughter isotopes around the world  47  additional fallout and pollution occurred from several nuclear accidents  48   uranium miners have a higher incidence of cancer  an excess risk of lung cancer among navajo uranium miners  for example  has been documented and linked to their occupation  49  the radiation exposure compensation act  a 1990 law in the usa  required $100,000 in  compassion payments  to uranium miners diagnosed with cancer or other respiratory ailments  50   during the cold war between the soviet union and the united states  huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium  since the break-up of the soviet union in 1991  an estimated 600\xa0short tons (540\xa0metric tons  of highly enriched weapons grade uranium  enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads  have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the russian federation and several other former soviet states  15  police in asia  europe  and south america on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium  most of which was from ex-soviet sources  15  from 1993 to 2005 the material protection  control  and accounting program  operated by the federal government of the united states  spent approximately us $550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in russia  15  this money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities  scientific american reported in february 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair  according to an interview from the article  one facility had been storing samples of enriched  weapons grade  uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project  another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box  51   along with all elements having atomic weights higher than that of iron  it is only naturally formed in supernovae  52  primordial thorium and uranium are only produced in the r-process  rapid neutron capture   because the s-process  slow neutron capture  is too slow and cannot pass the gap of instability after bismuth   uranium is a naturally occurring element that can be found in low levels within all rock  soil  and water  uranium is the 51st element in order of abundance in the earth s crust  uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on earth and is almost always found combined with other elements  9  the decay of uranium  thorium  and potassium-40 in the earth s mantle is thought to be the main source of heat 53][54  that keeps the outer core liquid and drives mantle convection  which in turn drives plate tectonics   uranium s average concentration in the earth s crust is  depending on the reference  2 to 4 parts per million  8][19  or about 40 times as abundant as silver  14  the earth s crust from the surface to 25\xa0km (15\xa0mi  down is calculated to contain 1017\xa0kg (2\xd71017\xa0lb  of uranium while the oceans may contain 1013\xa0kg (2\xd71013\xa0lb   8  the concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0.7 to 11 parts per million  up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate fertilizers   and its concentration in sea water is 3 parts per billion  19   uranium is more plentiful than antimony  tin  cadmium  mercury  or silver  and it is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum  9][19  uranium is found in hundreds of minerals  including uraninite  the most common uranium ore   carnotite  autunite  uranophane  torbernite  and coffinite  9  significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits  and minerals such as lignite  and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores 9   it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0.1  uranium 14     some bacteria  such as shewanella putrefaciens  geobacter metallireducens and some strains of burkholderia fungorum  use uranium for their growth and convert u vi  to u iv   55][56   some organisms  such as the lichen trapelia involuta or microorganisms such as the bacterium citrobacter  can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times the level of their environment  57  citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions when given glycerol phosphate  or other similar organic phosphates   after one day  one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals  this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water  26][58  the proteobacterium geobacter has also been shown to bioremediate uranium in ground water  59  the mycorrhizal fungus glomus intraradices increases uranium content in the roots of its symbiotic plant  60   in nature  uranium vi  forms highly soluble carbonate complexes at alkaline ph  this leads to an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards  however  it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline ph  a sphingomonas sp  strain bsar-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase  phok  that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions  the precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing phok protein in e  coli  61   plants absorb some uranium from soil  dry weight concentrations of uranium in plants range from 5 to 60 parts per billion  and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to 4 parts per million  26  dry weight concentrations of uranium in food plants are typically lower with one to two micrograms per day ingested through the food people eat  26   worldwide production of u3o8  yellowcake  in 2013 amounted to 70,015 tonnes  of which 22,451 t (32   was mined in kazakhstan  other important uranium mining countries are canada (9,331 t   australia (6,350 t   niger (4,518 t   namibia (4,323 t  and russia (3,135 t   62   uranium ore is mined in several ways  by open pit  underground  in-situ leaching  and borehole mining  see uranium mining   6  low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25  uranium oxides  extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore  63  high-grade ores found in athabasca basin deposits in saskatchewan  canada can contain up to 23  uranium oxides on average  64  uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali  the leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation  solvent extraction  and ion exchange  the resulting mixture  called yellowcake  contains at least 75  uranium oxides u3o8  yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion  65   commercial-grade uranium can be produced through the reduction of uranium halides with alkali or alkaline earth metals  9  uranium metal can also be prepared through electrolysis of kuf n5 or uf n4  dissolved in molten calcium chloride (cacl n2  and sodium chloride  nacl  solution  9  very pure uranium is produced through the thermal decomposition of uranium halides on a hot filament  9   it is estimated that 5.5 million tonnes of uranium exists in ore reserves that are economically viable at us 59 per lb of uranium  66  while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources  reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction   67  prices went from about $10 lb in may 2003 to $138 lb in july 2007  this has caused a big increase in spending on exploration  66  with us 200 million being spent worldwide in 2005  a 54  increase on the previous year  67  this trend continued through 2006  when expenditure on exploration rocketed to over $774 million  an increase of over 250  compared to 2004  the oecd nuclear energy agency said exploration figures for 2007 would likely match those for 2006.[66   australia has 31  of the world s known uranium ore reserves 68  and the world s largest single uranium deposit  located at the olympic dam mine in south australia  69  there is a significant reserve of uranium in bakouma a sub-prefecture in the prefecture of mbomou in central african republic   some nuclear fuel comes from nuclear weapons being dismantled  70  such as from the megatons to megawatts program   an additional 4.6 billion tonnes of uranium are estimated to be in sea water  japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of uranium from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible   71][72  there have been experiments to extract uranium from sea water  73  but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water  in 2012  ornl researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed hicap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules  atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water  according to results verified by researchers at pacific northwest national laboratory  74][75   in 2005  seventeen countries produced concentrated uranium oxides  with canada (27.9  of world production  and australia (22.8   being the largest producers and kazakhstan (10.5    russia (8.0    namibia (7.5    niger (7.4    uzbekistan (5.5    the united states (2.5    argentina (2.1    ukraine (1.9   and china (1.7   also producing significant amounts  77  kazakhstan continues to increase production and may have become the world s largest producer of uranium by 2009 with an expected production of 12,826\xa0tonnes  compared to canada with 11,100\xa0t and australia with 9,430\xa0t  78][79  in the late 1960s  un geologists also discovered major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in somalia  the find was the largest of its kind  with industry experts estimating the deposits at over 25  of the world s then known uranium reserves of 800,000 tons  80   the ultimate available supply is believed to be sufficient for at least the next 85 years  67  although some studies indicate underinvestment in the late twentieth century may produce supply problems in the 21st century  81  uranium deposits seem to be log-normal distributed  there is a 300-fold increase in the amount of uranium recoverable for each tenfold decrease in ore grade  82  in other words  there is little high grade ore and proportionately much more low grade ore available   calcined uranium yellowcake  as produced in many large mills  contains a distribution of uranium oxidation species in various forms ranging from most oxidized to least oxidized  particles with short residence times in a calciner will generally be less oxidized than those with long retention times or particles recovered in the stack scrubber  uranium content is usually referenced to u n3o n8  which dates to the days of the manhattan project when u n3o n8 was used as an analytical chemistry reporting standard   phase relationships in the uranium-oxygen system are complex  the most important oxidation states of uranium are uranium iv  and uranium vi   and their two corresponding oxides are  respectively  uranium dioxide (uo n2  and uranium trioxide (uo n3).[83  other uranium oxides such as uranium monoxide  uo   diuranium pentoxide (u n2o n5   and uranium peroxide (uo n4\xb72h n2o  also exist   the most common forms of uranium oxide are triuranium octoxide (u n3o n8  and uo n2.[84  both oxide forms are solids that have low solubility in water and are relatively stable over a wide range of environmental conditions  triuranium octoxide is  depending on conditions  the most stable compound of uranium and is the form most commonly found in nature  uranium dioxide is the form in which uranium is most commonly used as a nuclear reactor fuel  84  at ambient temperatures  uo n2 will gradually convert to u n3o n8  because of their stability  uranium oxides are generally considered the preferred chemical form for storage or disposal  84   salts of many oxidation states of uranium are water-soluble and may be studied in aqueous solutions  the most common ionic forms are u3   brown-red   u4   green   uo  n2  unstable   and uo2+\n2  yellow   for u iii   u iv   u v   and u vi   respectively  85  a few solid and semi-metallic compounds such as uo and us exist for the formal oxidation state uranium ii   but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state  ions of u3  liberate hydrogen from water and are therefore considered to be highly unstable  the uo2+\n2 ion represents the uranium vi  state and is known to form compounds such as uranyl carbonate  uranyl chloride and uranyl sulfate  uo2+\n2 also forms complexes with various organic chelating agents  the most commonly encountered of which is uranyl acetate  85   unlike the uranyl salts of uranium and polyatomic ion uranium-oxide cationic forms  the uranates  salts containing a polyatomic uranium-oxide anion  are generally not water-soluble   the interactions of carbonate anions with uranium vi  cause the pourbaix diagram to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution  while the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water  students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water   uranium carbonates are often soluble in water  this is because a u vi  cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes   the uranium fraction diagrams in the presence of carbonate illustrate this further  when the ph of a uranium vi  solution increases  the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high phs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex   when carbonate is added  uranium is converted to a series of carbonate complexes if the ph is increased  one effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the ph range 6 to 8  a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels   uranium metal heated to 250 to 300\xa0\xb0c (482 to 572\xa0\xb0f  reacts with hydrogen to form uranium hydride  even higher temperatures will reversibly remove the hydrogen  this property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium carbide  nitride  and halide compounds  87  two crystal modifications of uranium hydride exist  an \u03b1 form that is obtained at low temperatures and a \u03b2 form that is created when the formation temperature is above 250\xa0\xb0c  87   uranium carbides and uranium nitrides are both relatively inert semimetallic compounds that are minimally soluble in acids  react with water  and can ignite in air to form u n3o n8.[87  carbides of uranium include uranium monocarbide  uc   uranium dicarbide (uc n2   and diuranium tricarbide (u n2c n3   both uc and uc n2 are formed by adding carbon to molten uranium or by exposing the metal to carbon monoxide at high temperatures  stable below 1800\xa0\xb0c  u n2c n3 is prepared by subjecting a heated mixture of uc and uc n2 to mechanical stress  88  uranium nitrides obtained by direct exposure of the metal to nitrogen include uranium mononitride  un   uranium dinitride (un n2   and diuranium trinitride (u n2n n3).[88   all uranium fluorides are created using uranium tetrafluoride (uf n4   uf n4 itself is prepared by hydrofluorination of uranium dioxide  87  reduction of uf n4 with hydrogen at 1000\xa0\xb0c produces uranium trifluoride (uf n3   under the right conditions of temperature and pressure  the reaction of solid uf n4 with gaseous uranium hexafluoride (uf n6  can form the intermediate fluorides of u n2f n9  u n4f n17  and uf n5.[87   at room temperatures  uf n6 has a high vapor pressure  making it useful in the gaseous diffusion process to separate the rare uranium-235 from the common uranium-238 isotope  this compound can be prepared from uranium dioxide and uranium hydride by the following process  87   the resulting uf n6  a white solid  is highly reactive  by fluorination   easily sublimes  emitting a vapor that behaves as a nearly ideal gas   and is the most volatile compound of uranium known to exist  87   one method of preparing uranium tetrachloride (ucl n4  is to directly combine chlorine with either uranium metal or uranium hydride  the reduction of ucl n4 by hydrogen produces uranium trichloride (ucl n3  while the higher chlorides of uranium are prepared by reaction with additional chlorine  87  all uranium chlorides react with water and air   bromides and iodides of uranium are formed by direct reaction of  respectively  bromine and iodine with uranium or by adding uh n3 to those element s acids  87  known examples include  ubr n3  ubr n4  ui n3  and ui n4  uranium oxyhalides are water-soluble and include uo n2f n2  uocl n2  uo n2cl n2  and uo n2br n2  stability of the oxyhalides decrease as the atomic weight of the component halide increases  87   natural uranium consists of three major isotopes  uranium-238 (99.28  natural abundance   uranium-235 (0.71    and uranium-234 (0.0054    all three are radioactive  emitting alpha particles  with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission  rather than alpha emission  there are also five other trace isotopes  uranium-239  which is formed when 238u undergoes spontaneous fission  releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238u atom  uranium-237  which is formed when 238u captures a neutron but emits two more  which then decays to neptunium-237  and finally  uranium-233  which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237  it is also expected that thorium-232 should be able to undergo double beta decay  which would produce uranium-232  but this has not yet been observed experimentally  89   uranium-238 is the most stable isotope of uranium  with a half-life of about 4.468\xd7109 years  roughly the age of the earth  uranium-235 has a half-life of about 7.13\xd7108 years  and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48\xd7105 years  90  for natural uranium  about 49  of its alpha rays are emitted by each of 238u atom  and also 49  by 234u  since the latter is formed from the former  and about 2.0  of them by the 235u  when the earth was young  probably about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235  but the percentage of 234u was probably much lower than this   uranium-238 is usually an \u03b1 emitter  occasionally  it undergoes spontaneous fission   decaying through the  uranium series  of nuclear decay  which has 18 members  into lead-206  by a variety of different decay paths  14   the decay series of 235u  which is called the actinium series  has 15 members and eventually decays into lead-207.[14  the constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to daughter elements useful in radiometric dating   uranium-234  which is a member of the  uranium series   decays to lead-206 through a series of relatively short-lived isotopes   uranium-233 is made from thorium-232 by neutron bombardment  usually in a nuclear reactor  and 233u is also fissile  9  its decay series ends at bismuth-209 and thallium-205   uranium-235 is important for both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons  because it is the only uranium isotope existing in nature on earth in any significant amount that is fissile  this means that it can be split into two or three fragments  fission products  by thermal neutrons  14   uranium-238 is not fissile  but is a fertile isotope  because after neutron activation it can produce plutonium-239  another fissile isotope  indeed  the 238u nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope uranium-239  239u decays by beta emission to neptunium-239  also a beta-emitter  that decays in its turn  within a few days into plutonium-239  239pu was used as fissile material in the first atomic bomb detonated in the  trinity test  on 15 july 1945 in new mexico  31   in nature  uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2742   and uranium-235 (0.7204    isotope separation concentrates  enriches  the fissionable uranium-235 for nuclear weapons and most nuclear power plants  except for gas cooled reactors and pressurised heavy water reactors  most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the nuclear chain reaction  the concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve this is called a  critical mass    to be considered  enriched   the uranium-235 fraction should be between 3  and 5%.[91  this process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium-235 and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium-238  called depleted uranium or  du   to be considered  depleted   the uranium-235 isotope concentration should be no more than 0.3%.[92  the price of uranium has risen since 2001  so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35  uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment  driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above $130 per kilogram in july 2007 from $5 in 2001.[92   the gas centrifuge process  where gaseous uranium hexafluoride (uf n6  is separated by the difference in molecular weight between 235uf6 and 238uf6 using high-speed centrifuges  is the cheapest and leading enrichment process  30  the gaseous diffusion process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the manhattan project  in this process  uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly diffused through a silver-zinc membrane  and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate  since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235).[30  the molecular laser isotope separation method employs a laser beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine  this leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution  6  an alternative laser method of enrichment is known as atomic vapor laser isotope separation  avlis  and employs visible tunable lasers such as dye lasers  93  another method used is liquid thermal diffusion  8   a person can be exposed to uranium  or its radioactive daughters  such as radon  by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food  the amount of uranium in air is usually very small  however  people who work in factories that process phosphate fertilizers  live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons  live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used  or live or work near a coal-fired power plant  facilities that mine or process uranium ore  or enrich uranium for reactor fuel  may have increased exposure to uranium  94][95  houses or structures that are over uranium deposits  either natural or man-made slag deposits  may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas  the occupational safety and health administration  osha  has set the permissible exposure limit for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25\xa0mg m3 over an 8-hour workday  the national institute for occupational safety and health  niosh  has set a recommended exposure limit  rel  of 0.2\xa0mg m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6\xa0mg m3  at levels of 10\xa0mg m3  uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health  96   most ingested uranium is excreted during digestion  only 0.5  is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium  such as its oxide  are ingested  whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5%.[26  however  soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body  whereas insoluble uranium compounds  especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs  pose a more serious exposure hazard  after entering the bloodstream  the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay for many years in bone tissue because of uranium s affinity for phosphates  26  uranium is not absorbed through the skin  and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin   incorporated uranium becomes uranyl ions  which accumulate in bone  liver  kidney  and reproductive tissues  uranium can be decontaminated from steel surfaces 97  and aquifers  98   normal functioning of the kidney  brain  liver  heart  and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure  because  besides being weakly radioactive  uranium is a toxic metal  26][99][100  uranium is also a reproductive toxicant  101][102  radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation  the primary form of 238u decay  has a very short range  and will not penetrate skin  uranyl (uo2+\n2  ions  such as from uranium trioxide or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds  have been shown to cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals  103  while the cdc has published one study that no human cancer has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium  104  exposure to uranium and its decay products  especially radon  are widely known and significant health threats  19  exposure to strontium-90  iodine-131  and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure  but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons  105  although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of uranium hexafluoride has resulted in human fatalities  those deaths were associated with the generation of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid and uranyl fluoride rather than with uranium itself  106  finely divided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is pyrophoric  small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature  9   uranium metal is commonly handled with gloves as a sufficient precaution  107  uranium concentrate is handled and contained so as to ensure that people do not inhale or ingest it  107
