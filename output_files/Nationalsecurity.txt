Nationalsecurity
 national security is a concept that a government  along with its parliaments  should protect the state and its citizens against all kind of  national  crises through a variety of power projections  such as political power  diplomacy  economic power  military might  and so on   the concept developed all in the united states after world war ii  initially focusing on military might  it now encompasses a broad range of facets  all of which impinge on the non-military or economic security of the nation and the values espoused by the national society  accordingly  in order to possess national security  a nation needs to possess economic security  energy security  environmental security  etc  security threats involve not only conventional foes such as other nation-states but also non-state actors such as violent non-state actors  narcotic cartels  multinational corporations and non-governmental organisations  some authorities include natural disasters and events causing severe environmental damage in this category   measures taken to ensure national security include       there is no single universally accepted definition of national security  the variety of definitions provide an overview of the many usages of this concept  the concept still remains ambiguous  having originated from simpler definitions which initially emphasised the freedom from military threat and political coercion to later increase in sophistication and include other forms of non-military security as suited the circumstances of the time  1]:1\u20136[2]:52\u201354  a typical dictionary definition  in this case from the macmillan dictionary  online version   defines the term as  the protection or the safety of a country u2019s secrets and its citizens  emphasising the overall security of a nation and a nation state  3  walter lippmann  in 1943  defined it in terms of war saying that  a nation has security when it does not have to sacrifice its legitimate  xednterests to avoid war  and is able  if challenged  to maintain them by war   1]:5 a later definition by harold lasswell  a political scientist  in 1950  looks at national security from almost the same aspect  that of external coercion   the distinctive meaning of national security means freedom from foreign dictation   1]:79  in 1960 arnold wolfers  while recognising the need to segregate the subjectivity of the conceptual idea from the objectivity  talks of threats to acquired values   an ambiguous symbol meaning different things to different people  national security objectively means the absence of threats to acquired values and subjectively  the absence of fear that such values will be attacked   4  the 1996 definition propagated by the national defence college of india accretes the elements of national power   national security is an appropriate and aggressive blend of political resilience and maturity  human resources  economic structure and capacity  technological competence  industrial base and availability of natural resources and finally the military might   5   harold brown  u s  secretary of defense from 1977 to 1981 in the carter administration  enlarged the definition of national security by including elements such as economic and environmental security   national security then is the ability to preserve the nation s physical integrity and territory  to maintain its economic relations with the rest of the world on reasonable terms  to preserve its nature  institution  and governance from disruption from outside  and to control its borders  6   in 1990  harvard university history professor charles maier defined national security through the lens of national power   national security    is best described as a capacity to control those domestic and foreign conditions that the public opinion of a given community believes necessary to enjoy its own self-determination or autonomy  prosperity and wellbeing   7  according to prabhakaran paleri  author of national security  imperatives and challenges  national security may be defined as   the measurable state of the capability of a nation to overcome the multi-dimensional threats to the apparent well-being of its people and its survival as a nation-state at any given time  by balancing all instruments of state policy through governance  that can be indexed by computation  empirically or otherwise  and is extendable to global security by variables external to it  2]:52\u201354  a concise working definition by premaratne 8  that paraphrases the aspects of the definitions of brown  6  romm 1  and paleri 2]:52\u201354 defines national security as  safeguarding the sovereignty  territorial integrity  citizenry and socioeconomic functionality of a nation from an aggressor intent on undermining a particular valued aspect of a nation through violent or unjust means  the origin of the modern concept of  national security  as a philosophy of maintaining a stable nation state can be traced to the peace of westphalia in 1648  wherein the concept of a sovereign state  ruled by a sovereign  became the basis of a new international order of nation states  9]:19 it was thomas hobbes in his 1651 work leviathan who stated that citizens yield to a powerful sovereign who in turn promises an end to civil and religious war  and to bring forth a lasting peace  and give him the right to conduct policy  including wage war or negotiate for peace for the good of the  commonwealth   i e   a mandate for national security  10  the clausewitzian view of diplomacy and war being the instruments of furthering national cause  added to the view of national security being sought by nations by exercising self-interest at all times  10  this view came to be known as  classical realism  in international relations   immanuel kant  in his 1795 essay  perpetual peace  a philosophical sketch  zum ewigen frieden xa0 de   proposed a system where nation-states and dominating national interests were replaced by an enlightened world order  a community of mankind where nation-states subsumed the national interests under the rule of the international law because of rational insight  common good and moral commitment  national security was achieved by this voluntary accession by the leadership to a higher order than the nation-state  viz   international security   thus was born the  idealist  school of international relations  10   as an academic concept  national security can be seen as a recent phenomenon which was first introduced in the united states after world war ii  1]:2\u20134 and has to some degree replaced other concepts that describe the struggle of states to overcome various external and internal threats  the term was used during discourse on war  for example  walter lippmann in 1943 criticized an unwillingness of political pundits to discuss  the foundations of national security  in a time of peace  11]:49 however  the earliest mention of the term national security  can be traced to 1790 in yale university in reference to its relation with domestic industries  2]:52  karl loewenstein and hans speier developed the notion of militant democracy  where national security threats like fascists and communists seeking to overthrow democracy  should be fought against by restricting democratic freedoms  their concerns were largely influential including a 1956 german supreme court that outlawed communism  [12   during the cold war national security was largely interpreted as meaning defense from the threat of communist overthrow of governments   as in the case of national power  the military aspect of security is an important  but not the sole  component of national security  to be truly secure  a nation needs other forms of security  authorities differ in their choice of nation security elements  besides the military aspect of security  the aspects of diplomacy or politics  society  environment  energy and natural resources  and economics are commonly listed  the elements of national security correlate closely to the concept of the elements of national power  romm (1993  lists security from narcotic cartels  economic security  environmental security and energy security as the non-military elements of national security  1  v  1\u20138  military security is traditionally the earliest recognised form of national security  2]:67 military security implies the capability of a nation to defend itself  and or deter military aggression  alternatively  military security implies the capability of a nation to enforce its policy choices by use of military force  the term  military security  is considered synonymous with  security  in much of its usage  one of the definitions of security given in the dictionary of military and associated terms  may be considered a definition of military security   a condition that results from the establishment and maintenance of protective measures that ensure a state of inviolability from hostile acts or influences   13   the political aspect of security has been offered by barry buzan  ole w xe6ver  jaap de wilde as an important component of national security  political security is about the stability of the social order  closely allied to military security and societal security  other components proposed in a framework for national security in their book  security  a new framework for analysis   it specifically addresses threats to sovereignty  14  system referent objects are defined  such as nation-states  nations  transnational groups of political importance including tribes  minorities  some religious organisations  systems of states such as the european union and the united nations  besides others  diplomacy  negotiation and other interactions form the means of interaction between the objects   historically  conquest of nations has made conquerors rich through plunder  access to new resources and enlarged trade by controlling a conquered nations  economy  in today s complex system of international trade  characterised by multi-national agreements  mutual inter-dependence and availability of natural resources etc   the freedom to exercise choice of policies to develop a nation s economy in the manner desired  invites economic security  economic security today forms  arguably  as important a part of national security as military security  the creation and protection of jobs that supply defense and non-defense needs are vital to national security  third world countries are less secure due to lack of employment for their citizens   environmental security deals with environmental issues which threaten the national security of a nation in any manner  the scope and nature of environmental threats to national security and strategies to engage them are a subject of debate  1]:29\u201333 while all environmental events are not considered significant of being categorised as threats  many transnational issues  both global and regional would affect national security  romm (1993  classifies these as  1]:15  prabhakaran paleri s 2008 definition of a resource is     a support inventory    biotic or abiotic  renewable or expendable     for sustaining life at a heightened level of well-being   2]:179  resources include water  sources of energy  land and minerals  availability of adequate natural resources is important for a nation to develop its industry and economic power  lack of resources is a serious challenge for japan to overcome to increase its national power  in the persian gulf war of 1991  fought over economic issues  iraq captured kuwait in order to capture its oil wells  among other reasons  water resources are subject to disputes between many nations  including the two nuclear powers  india and pakistan  nations attempt to attain energy and natural resource security by acquiring the needed resources by force  negotiation and commerce   the interrelation between security  energy  natural resources  and their sustainability is increasingly acknowledged by the international community  as proven by the fact that energy is now one of the issues amidst the un sustainable development goals  as well as a cardinal issues for investment promotion policies at national level  16   recently  cybersecurity began to be viewed as a pressing national security issue  electronic information systems are vital for maintaining a national security of any state  possible unauthorized access to the critical governmental infrastructures by state and non-state entities can create a serious threat and have a negative impact on political  economic and military security of a given nation   in the united states  the bush administration in january 2008  initiated the comprehensive national cybersecurity initiative  cnci   it introduced a differentiated approach  such as  identifying existing and emerging cybersecurity threats  finding and plugging existing cyber vulnerabilities  and apprehending actors that trying to gain access to secure federal information systems  17  president obama issued a declaration that the  cyber threat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation  and that  america s economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cybersecurity   18   u s  secretary of state hillary clinton has said that  the countries that threaten regional and global peace are the very places where women and girls are deprived of dignity and opportunity   19  she has noted that countries where women are oppressed are places where the  rule of law and democracy are struggling to take root   19  and that  when women s rights as equals in society are upheld  the society as a whole changes and improves  which in turn enhances stability in that society  which in turn contributes to global society  19   national security ideology as taught by the us army school of the americas to military personnel were vital in causing the military coup of 1964  the military dictatorship was installed on the claim by military that leftists were an existential threat to the national interests  20   china s armed forces are known as the people s liberation army  pla   the military is sizeable with 2.3 million active troops in 2005   the ministry of state security was established in 1983 to ensure \u201cthe security of the state through effective measures against enemy agents  spies  and counterrevolutionary activities designed to sabotage or overthrow china u2019s socialist system  u201d  muslim separatists in xinjiang uygur autonomous region are china s most significant domestic threat   in the years 1997 and 2000  russia adopted documents titled  national security concept  that described russia s global position  the country s interests  listed threats to national security and described the means to counter those threats  in 2009  these documents were superseded by the  national security strategy to 2020   the key body responsible for coordination of policies related to russia s national security is the security council of russia   according to provision 6 of the national security strategy to 2020  national security is  the situation in which the individual  the society and the state enjoy protection from foreign and domestic threats to the degree that ensures constitutional rights and freedoms  decent quality of life for citizens  as well as sovereignty  territorial integrity and stable development of the russian federation  the defense and security of the state    the primary body responsible for coordinating national security policy in the uk is the national security council  united kingdom   it was created in may 2010 by the new coalition government of the conservative party  uk  and liberal democrats  the national security council is a committee of the cabinet of the united kingdom and was created as part of a wider reform of the national security apparatus  this reform also included the creation of a national security adviser  united kingdom  and a national security secretariat to support the national security council  21   the concept of national security became an official guiding principle of foreign policy in the united states when the national security act of 1947 was signed on july 26  1947 by u s  president harry s  truman  1]:3 as amended in 1949  this act   notably  the act did not define national security  which was conceivably advantageous  as its ambiguity made it a powerful phrase to invoke whenever issues threatened by other interests of the state  such as domestic concerns  came up for discussion and decision  1]:3\u20135  the notion that national security encompasses more than just military security was present  though understated  from the beginning  the act established the national security council so as to  advise the president on the integration of domestic  military and foreign policies relating to national security   2]:52  while not defining the  interests  of national security  the act does establish  within the national security council  the  committee on foreign intelligence   whose duty is to conduct an annual review  identifying the intelligence required to address the national security interests of the united states as specified by the president   emphasis added   23   in gen  maxwell taylor s 1974 essay  the legitimate claims of national security   taylor states  24   the national valuables in this broad sense include current assets and national interests  as well as the sources of strength upon which our future as a nation depends  some valuables are tangible and earthy  others are spiritual or intellectual  they range widely from political assets such as the bill of rights  our political institutions and international friendships  to many economic assets which radiate worldwide from a highly productive domestic economy supported by rich natural resources  it is the urgent need to protect valuables such as these which legitimizes and makes essential the role of national security   the u s  armed forces defines national security of the united states in the following manner xa0:[25   a collective term encompassing both national defense and foreign relations of the united states  specifically  the condition provided by  a  a military or defense advantage over any foreign nation or group of nations  b  a favorable foreign relations position  or c  a defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostile or destructive action from within or without  overt or covert   in 2010  the white house included an all-encompassing world-view in a national security strategy which identified  security  as one of the country s  four enduring national interests  that were  inexorably intertwined   26    to achieve the world we seek  the united states must apply our strategic approach in pursuit of four enduring national interests   conceptualising and understanding the national security choices and challenges of african states is a difficult task  this is due to the fact that it is often not rooted in the understanding of their  mostly disrupted  state formation and their often imported process of state building   although post-cold war conceptualizations of security have broadened  the policies and practices of many african states still privilege national security as being synonymous with state security and even more narrowly- regime security   the problem with the above is that a number of african states have been unable to govern their security in meaningful ways  often failing to be able to claim the monopoly of force in their territories  a hybridity of security \u2018governance u2019 or \u2018providers u2019 thus exists  27  states that have not been able to capture this reality in official national security strategies and policies often find their claim over having the monopoly of force and thus being the sovereign challenged  27  this often leads to the weakening of the state  examples of such states are south sudan and somalia   to reflect on institutionalization of new bureaucratic infrastructures and governmental practices in the post-world war ii period in the u s   when a culture of semi-permanent military mobilization brought around the national security council  the cia  the department of defense  and the joint chiefs of staff  national-security researchers apply a notion of a national security state  28][29][30   during and after worldwar ii  us leaders expanded the concept of national security and used its terminology for the first time to explain america u2019s relationship to the world  for most of us history  the physical security of the continental united states had not been in jeopardy  but by 1945  this invulnerability was rapidly diminishing with the advent of long-range bombers  atom bombs  and ballistic missiles  a general perception grew that the future would not allow time to mobilize  that preparation would have to become constant  for the first time  american leaders would have to deal with the essential paradox of national security faced by the roman empire and subsequent great powers  si vis pacem  para bellum \u2014 if you want peace  prepare for war  31   the measures nearly universally adopted around the world to maintain national security in the face of the possible threats has led to ongoing dialectic struggle  particularly in liberal democracies  between government authority and civil and human rights  these are natural tensions of the process of maintaining self-determination and sovereignty and keeping the rights and freedoms of individuals   although national security measures are imposed to protect society as a whole  many such measures may restrict the rights and freedoms of individuals in society  where the exercise of national security laws and powers is not subject to good governance  the rule of law  and strict checks and balances  there is a risk that national security may simply serve as a pretext for suppressing unfavorable political and social views   in the united states  the controversial usa patriot act and other governmental actions has brought the issues of rights and freedoms to citizen s attention  among questions raised  to what extent for the sake of national security individual rights and freedoms can be restricted  and how the restriction of civil rights for the sake of national security be justified in an absence of war   because of the highly competitive nature of nation states and the fluid state of world order  national security preparedness depends as much on routine technical measures and operational procedures as on central decision making  this ranges from information protection to state secrets to weaponry to international negotiation strategies  any given national security apparatus runs on combination of management practices and technical capabilities  emerging issues such as proliferation  failing states  climate change and global terrorism 32  increasingly dominate the reality of competition between nation states  all of these lead to the need to have a clear understanding of the technical issues underlying national security in order to create and sustain the national security institutions that may ultimately affect the future of a nation state    media related to national
