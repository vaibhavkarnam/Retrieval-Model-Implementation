 iceland (i  u02c8a u026asl u0259nd   icelandic   xcdsland pronounced  xa0[\u02c8istlant    7  is a nordic island country in the north atlantic ocean  it has a population of 332,529 and an area of 103,000\xa0km2 (40,000\xa0sq xa0mi   making it the most sparsely populated country in europe  8  the capital and largest city is reykjav xedk  reykjav xedk and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population  iceland is volcanically and geologically active  the interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields  mountains and glaciers  while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands  iceland is warmed by the gulf stream and has a temperate climate  despite a high latitude just outside the arctic circle  its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly  with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate   according to the ancient manuscript landn xe1mab xf3k  the settlement of iceland began in the year 874 ad when the norwegian chieftain ing xf3lfr arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island  9  in the following centuries  norwegians  and to a lesser extent other scandinavians  immigrated to iceland  bringing with them thralls of gaelic origin  the island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the althing  one of the world s oldest functioning legislative assemblies  following a period of civil strife  iceland acceded to norwegian rule in the 13th century  the establishment of the kalmar union in 1397 united the kingdoms of norway  denmark and sweden  iceland thus followed norway s integration to that union and came under danish rule after sweden s secession from that union in 1523  although the danish kingdom introduced lutheranism forcefully in 1550  iceland remained a distant semi-colonial territory in which danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence  in the wake of the french revolution and the napoleonic wars  iceland s struggle for independence took form and culminated in independence in 1918 and the founding of a republic in 1944  until the 20th century  iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture  and was among the poorest in europe  industrialisation of the fisheries and marshall plan aid following world war ii brought prosperity  and iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world  in 1994  it became a part of the european economic area  which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance  biotechnology  and manufacturing   iceland has a market economy with relatively low taxes compared to other oecd countries  10  it maintains a nordic social welfare system that provides universal health care and tertiary education for its citizens  11  iceland ranks high in economic  political and social stability and equality  in 2013  it was ranked as the 13th most-developed country in the world by the united nations  human development index  6  iceland runs almost completely on renewable energy  affected by the ongoing worldwide financial crisis  the nation s entire banking system systemically failed in october 2008  leading to a severe depression  substantial political unrest  the icesave dispute  and the institution of capital controls  many bankers were jailed  12  and the economy has made a significant recovery  in large part due to a surge in tourism  13][14][15   icelandic culture is founded upon the nation s scandinavian heritage  most icelanders are descendants of germanic and gaelic settlers  icelandic  a north germanic language  is descended from old norse and is closely related to faroese and west norwegian dialects  the country s cultural heritage includes traditional icelandic cuisine  icelandic literature and medieval sagas  iceland has the smallest population of any nato member and is the only one with no standing army  its lightly armed coast guard being in charge of defence  16       according to both landn xe1mab xf3k and \xcdslendingab xf3k  celtic monks known as the papar lived in iceland before scandinavian settlers arrived  possibly members of a hiberno-scottish mission  recent archaeological excavations have revealed the ruins of a cabin in hafnir on the reykjanes peninsula  carbon dating indicates that it was abandoned sometime between 770 and 880.[17  in 2016  archeologists uncovered a longhouse in st xf6\xf0varfj xf6r xf0ur that has been dated to as early as the year 800.[18   swedish viking explorer gar xf0ar svavarsson was the first to circumnavigate iceland in 870 and establish that it was an island  19  he stayed over winter and built a house in h xfasav xedk  gar xf0ar departed the following summer but one of his men  n xe1ttfari  decided to stay behind with two slaves  n xe1ttfari settled in what is now known as n xe1ttfarav xedk and he and his slaves became the first permanent residents of iceland  20][21   the norwegian-norse chieftain ing xf3lfr arnarson built his homestead in present-day reykjav xedk in the year 874  ing xf3lfr was followed by many other emigrant settlers  largely scandinavians and their thralls  many of whom were irish or scottish  22  by 930  most arable land on the island had been claimed  the althing  a legislative and judicial assembly  was initiated to regulate the icelandic commonwealth  lack of arable land also served impetus to the settlement of greenland starting in 986.[23  the period of these early settlements coincided with the medieval warm period  when temperatures were similar to those of the early 20th century  24  at this time  about 25  of iceland was covered with forest  compared to 1  in the present day  25  christianity was adopted by consensus around 999\u20131000  although norse paganism persisted among some segments of the population for some years afterwards  citation needed   the icelandic commonwealth lasted until the 13th century  when the political system devised by the original settlers proved unable to cope with the increasing power of icelandic chieftains  26  the internal struggles and civil strife of the age of the sturlungs led to the signing of the old covenant in 1262  which ended the commonwealth and brought iceland under the norwegian crown  possession of iceland passed from the norwegian empire to the kalmar union in 1415  when the kingdoms of norway  denmark and sweden were united  after the break-up of the union in 1523  it remained a norwegian dependency  as a part of denmark u2013norway   in the ensuing centuries  iceland became one of the poorest countries in europe  infertile soil  volcanic eruptions  deforestation and an unforgiving climate made for harsh life in a society where subsistence depended almost entirely on agriculture  the black death swept iceland twice  first in 1402\u20131404 and again in 1494\u20131495.[27  the former outbreak killed 50  to 60  of the population  and the latter 30  to 50%.[28   around the middle of the 16th century  as part of the protestant reformation  king christian iii of denmark began to impose lutheranism on all his subjects  j xf3n arason  the last catholic bishop of h xf3lar  was beheaded in 1550 along with two of his sons  the country subsequently became officially lutheran and lutheranism has since remained the dominant religion   in the 17th and 18th centuries  denmark imposed harsh trade restrictions on iceland  natural disasters  including volcanic eruption and disease  contributed to a decreasing population  pirates from several countries  including the barbary coast  raided its coastal settlements and abducted people into slavery  29][30  a great smallpox epidemic in the 18th century killed around a third of the population  31][32  in 1783 the laki volcano erupted  with devastating effects  33  in the years following the eruption  known as the mist hardships  icelandic  m xf3\xf0uhar xf0indin   over half of all livestock died in the country  around a quarter of the population died in the ensuing famine  34   in 1814  following the napoleonic wars  denmark-norway was broken up into two separate kingdoms via the treaty of kiel but iceland remained a danish dependency  throughout the 19th century  the country s climate continued to grow colder  resulting in mass emigration to the new world  particularly to the region of gimli  manitoba in canada  which was sometimes referred to as new iceland  about 15,000 people emigrated  out of a total population of 70,000.[35   a national consciousness arose in the first half of the 19th century  inspired by romantic and nationalist ideas from mainland europe  an icelandic independence movement took shape in the 1850s under the leadership of j xf3n sigur xf0sson  based on the burgeoning icelandic nationalism inspired by the fj xf6lnismenn and other danish-educated icelandic intellectuals  in 1874  denmark granted iceland a constitution and limited home rule  this was expanded in 1904  and hannes hafstein served as the first minister for iceland in the danish cabinet   the danish u2013icelandic act of union  an agreement with denmark signed on 1 december 1918 and valid for 25\xa0years  recognised iceland as a fully sovereign state in a personal union with denmark  the government of iceland established an embassy in copenhagen and requested that denmark handle icelandic foreign policy  danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags  those of the kingdom of denmark and those of the kingdom of iceland   during world war ii  iceland joined denmark in asserting neutrality  after the german occupation of denmark on 9 april 1940  the althing replaced the king with a regent and declared that the icelandic government would take control of foreign affairs and other matters previously handled by denmark  a month later  british armed forces invaded and occupied the country  violating icelandic neutrality  in 1941  the occupation was taken over by the united states so that britain could use its troops elsewhere   on 31 december 1943  the danish u2013icelandic act of union expired after 25\xa0years  beginning on 20 may 1944  icelanders voted in a four-day plebiscite on whether to terminate the personal union with denmark  abolish the monarchy  and establish a republic  the vote was 97  to end the union  and 95  in favour of the new republican constitution  36  iceland formally became a republic on 17 june 1944  with sveinn bj xf6rnsson as its first president   in 1946  the allied occupation force left iceland  the nation formally became a member of nato on 30 march 1949  amid domestic controversy and riots  on 5 may 1951  a defence agreement was signed with the united states  american troops returned to iceland as the iceland defence force  and remained throughout the cold war  the us withdrew the last of its forces on 30 september 2006   iceland had prospered during the war  the immediate post-war period was followed by substantial economic growth  driven by industrialisation of the fishing industry and the us marshall plan programme  through which icelanders received the most aid per capita of any european country  at usd 209  with the war-ravaged netherlands a distant second at usd 109).[37][38   the 1970s were marked by the cod wars xa0\u2014 several disputes with the united kingdom over iceland s extension of its fishing limits to 200\xa0miles offshore  iceland hosted a summit in reykjav xedk in 1986 between united states president ronald reagan and soviet premier mikhail gorbachev  during which they took significant steps toward nuclear disarmament  a few years later  iceland became the first country to recognize the independence of estonia  latvia  and lithuania as they broke away from the ussr  throughout the 1990s  the country expanded its international role and developed a foreign policy oriented toward humanitarian and peacekeeping causes  to that end  iceland provided aid and expertise to various nato-led interventions in bosnia  kosovo  and iraq  39   iceland joined the european economic area in 1994  after which the economy was greatly diversified and liberalised  international economic relations increased further after 2001  when iceland s newly deregulated banks began to raise massive amounts of external debt  contributing to a 32  increase in iceland s gross national income between 2002 and 2007.[40][41   in the years 2003\u20132007  following the privatization of the banking sector under the government of dav xed xf0 oddsson  iceland moved toward having an economy based on international investment banking and financial services  42  it was quickly becoming one of the most prosperous countries in the world but was hit hard by a major financial crisis  42  the crisis resulted in the greatest migration from iceland since 1887  with a net emigration of 5,000 people in 2009.[43  iceland s economy stabilised under the government of j xf3hanna sigur xf0ard xf3ttir  and grew by 1.6  in 2012.[44  many icelanders  however  have remained unhappy with the state of the economy and government austerity policies  the centre-right independence party was returned to power in coalition with the progressive party in the 2013 elections  45   iceland is at the juncture of the north atlantic and arctic oceans  the main island is entirely south of the arctic circle  which passes through the small icelandic island of gr xedmsey off the main island s northern coast  the country lies between latitudes 63 and 68\xb0n  and longitudes 25 and 13\xb0w   iceland is closer to continental europe than to mainland north america  thus  the island is generally included in europe for historical  political  cultural  and practical reasons  geologically  the island includes parts of both continental plates  the closest body of land is greenland (290\xa0km  180\xa0mi   the closest bodies of land in europe are the faroe islands (420\xa0km  260\xa0mi   jan mayen island (570\xa0km  350\xa0mi   shetland and the outer hebrides  both about 740\xa0km (460\xa0mi   and the

is the deepest lake  at 248\xa0m (814\xa0ft   47   geologically  iceland is part of the mid-atlantic ridge  a ridge along which the oceanic crust spreads and forms new oceanic crust  this part of the mid-ocean ridge is located above a mantle plume  causing iceland to be subaerial  above the surface of the sea   the ridge marks the boundary between the eurasian and north american plates  and iceland was created by rifting and accretion through volcanism along the ridge  48   many fjords punctuate iceland s 4,970-km-long (3,088-mi  coastline  which is also where most settlements are situated  the island s interior  the highlands of iceland  is a cold and uninhabitable combination of sand  mountains  and lava fields  the major towns are the capital city of reykjav xedk  along with its outlying towns of k xf3pavogur  hafnarfj xf6r xf0ur  and gar xf0ab xe6r  nearby reykjanesb xe6r where the international airport is located  and the town of akureyri in northern iceland  the island of gr xedmsey on the arctic circle contains the northernmost habitation of iceland  whereas kolbeinsey contains the northernmost point of iceland  49  iceland has three national parks  vatnaj xf6kull national park  sn xe6fellsj xf6kull national park  and  xdeingvellir national park  50  the country is considered a  strong performer  in environmental protection  having been ranked 13th in yale university s environmental performance index of 2012.[51   iceland  as seen from space on 29 january 2004  su xf0ureyri  nor xf0fj xf6r xf0ur  the eruption of eyjafjallaj xf6kull  south of iceland  off the ring road  looking north  late afternoon in winter 2001  a geologically young land  iceland is located on both the iceland hotspot and the mid-atlantic ridge  which runs right through it  this location means that the island is highly geologically active with many volcanoes  notably hekla  eldgj xe1  her xf0ubrei xf0  and eldfell  52  the volcanic eruption of laki in 1783\u20131784 caused a famine that killed nearly a quarter of the island s population  53  in addition  the eruption caused dust clouds and haze to appear over most of europe and parts of asia and africa for several months afterward  and affected climates in other areas  54   iceland has many geysers  including geysir  from which the english word is derived  and the famous strokkur  which erupts every 8\u201310\xa0minutes  after a phase of inactivity  geysir started erupting again after a series of earthquakes in 2000  geysir has since grown quieter and does not erupt often  55   with the widespread availability of geothermal power  and the harnessing of many rivers and waterfalls for hydroelectricity  most residents have access to inexpensive hot water  heating  and electricity  the island is composed primarily of basalt  a low-silica lava associated with effusive volcanism as has occurred also in hawaii  iceland  however  has a variety of volcanic types  composite and fissure   many producing more evolved lavas such as rhyolite and andesite  iceland has hundreds of volcanoes with about 30 active volcanic systems  56   surtsey  one of the youngest islands in the world  is part of iceland  named after surtr  it rose above the ocean in a series of volcanic eruptions between 8 november 1963 and 5 june 1968.[49  only scientists researching the growth of new life are allowed to visit the island  57   on 21 march 2010  a volcano in eyjafjallaj xf6kull in the south of iceland erupted for the first time since 1821  forcing 600 people to flee their homes  58  additional eruptions on 14 april forced hundreds of people to abandon their homes  59  the resultant cloud of volcanic ash brought major disruption to air travel across europe  60   another large eruption occurred on 21 may 2011  this time it was the gr xedmsv xf6tn volcano  located under the thick ice of europe s largest glacier  vatnaj xf6kull  gr xedmsv xf6tn is one of iceland s most active volcanoes  and this eruption was much more powerful than the 2010 eyjafjallaj xf6kull activity  with ash and lava hurled 20\xa0km (12\xa0mi  into the atmosphere  creating a large cloud  61   the highest elevation for iceland is listed as 2,110 m (6,923\xa0ft  at hvannadalshn xfakur (64\xb000\u2032n 16\xb039\u2032w    the climate of iceland s coast is subarctic  the warm north atlantic current ensures generally higher annual temperatures than in most places of similar latitude in the world  regions in the world with similar climates include the aleutian islands  the alaska peninsula  and tierra del fuego  although these regions are closer to the equator  despite its proximity to the arctic  the island s coasts remain ice-free through the winter  ice incursions are rare  the last having occurred on the north coast in 1969.[62   the climate varies between different parts of the island  generally speaking  the south coast is warmer  wetter  and windier than the north  the central highlands are the coldest part of the country  low-lying inland areas in the north are the most arid  snowfall in winter is more common in the north than the south   the highest air temperature recorded was 30.5\xa0\xb0c (86.9\xa0\xb0f  on 22 june 1939 at teigarhorn on the southeastern coast  the lowest was \u221238\xa0\xb0c (\u221236.4\xa0\xb0f  on 22 january 1918 at gr xedmssta

when humans arrived was the arctic fox  65  which came to the island at the end of the ice age  walking over the frozen sea  on rare occasions  bats have been carried to the island with the winds  but they are not able to breed there  polar bears occasionally come over from greenland  but they are just visitors  and no icelandic populations exist  66  no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians are on the island  67   phytogeographically  iceland belongs to the arctic province of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom  around three-quarters of the island is barren of vegetation  plant life consists mainly of grassland  which is regularly grazed by livestock  the most common tree native to iceland is the northern birch  betula pubescens   which formerly formed forests over much of iceland  along with aspens  populus tremula   rowans  sorbus aucuparia   common junipers  juniperus communis   and other smaller trees  mainly willows   when the island was first settled  it was extensively forested  in the late 12th century  ari the wise described it in the \xcdslendingab xf3k as  forested from mountain to sea shore   68  permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin  volcanic soils and limited species diversity  the forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber  65  deforestation  climatic deterioration during the little ice age  and overgrazing by sheep imported by settlers caused a loss of critical topsoil due to erosion  today  many farms have been abandoned  three-quarters of iceland s 100,000 square kilometres is affected by soil erosion 18,000\xa0km2 (6,900\xa0sq xa0mi   serious enough to make the land useless  68  only a few small birch stands now exist in isolated reserves  the planting of new forests has increased the number of trees  but the result does not compare to the original forests  some of the planted forests include introduced species  65  the tallest tree in iceland is a sitka spruce planted in 1949 in kirkjub xe6jarklaustur  it was measured at 25.2\xa0m (83\xa0ft  in 2013.[69   the animals of iceland include the icelandic sheep  cattle  chickens  goats  the sturdy icelandic horse  and the icelandic sheepdog  all descendants of animals imported by europeans  wild mammals include the arctic fox  mink  mice  rats  rabbits  and reindeer  polar bears occasionally visit the island  travelling on icebergs from greenland  in june 2008  two polar bears arrived in the same month  70  marine mammals include the grey seal  halichoerus grypus  and harbor seal  phoca vitulina   many species of fish live in the ocean waters surrounding iceland  and the fishing industry is a major part of iceland s economy  accounting for roughly half of the country s total exports  birds  especially seabirds  are an important part of iceland s animal life  puffins  skuas  and kittiwakes nest on its sea cliffs  71   commercial whaling is practised intermittently 72][73  along with scientific whale hunts  74  whale watching has become an important part of iceland s economy since 1997.[75   iceland has a left u2013right multi-party system  following the 2013 parliamentary election  the biggest parties are the centre-right independence party (sj xe1lfst xe6\xf0isflokkurinn  and the progressive party (frams xf3knarflokkurinn   other political parties with seats in the althing are the centre-left social democratic alliance  samfylkingin   left-green movement (vinstrihreyfingin xa0\u2013 gr xe6nt frambo xf0   bright future (bj xf6rt framt xed xf0   and the pirate party of iceland  p xedratar   many other parties exist on the municipal level  most of which run only locally in a single municipality   iceland was the first country in the world to have a political party formed and led entirely by women  76  known as the women s list or women s alliance  kvennalistinn   it was founded in 1983 to advance the political  economic  and social needs of women  after participating in its first parliamentary elections  the women s list helped increase the proportion of female parliamentarians by 15%.[77  although it disbanded in 1999  merging with the social democratic alliance  it left a lasting influence on iceland s politics  every major party has a 40  quota for women  and in 2009 nearly a third of members of parliament were female  compared to the global average of 16%.[78   in 2016 iceland was ranked 2nd in the strength of its democratic institutions 79  and 13th in government transparency  80  the country has a high level of civic participation  with 81.4  voter turnout during the most recent elections  81  compared to an oecd average of 72   however  only 50  of icelanders say they trust their political institutions  slightly less than the oecd average of 56   and most probably a consequence of the political scandals in the wake of the icelandic financial crisis   82   iceland is a representative democracy and a parliamentary republic  the modern parliament  al xfeingi  english  althing   was founded in 1845 as an advisory body to the danish monarch  it was widely seen as a re-establishment of the assembly founded in 930 in the commonwealth period and suspended in 1799  consequently   it is arguably the world s oldest parliamentary democracy   83  it currently has 63 members  elected for a maximum period of four years  84  the president is elected by popular vote for a term of four years  with no term limit  the elections for president  the althing and local municipal councils are all held separately every four years  85   the president of iceland is a largely ceremonial head of state and serves as a diplomat  but may veto laws voted by the parliament and put them to a national referendum  the current president is gu xf0ni th  j xf3hannesson  the head of government is the prime minister who  together with the cabinet  is responsible for executive government  the cabinet is appointed by the president after a general election to the althing  however  the appointment is usually negotiated by the leaders of the political parties  who decide among themselves after discussions which parties can form the cabinet and how to distribute its seats  under the condition that it has a majority support in the althing  only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally  this has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944  but in 1942 regent sveinn bj xf6rnsson  who had been installed in that position by the althing in 1941  appointed a non-parliamentary government  the regent had  for all practical purposes  the position of a president  and sveinn would later become the country s first president in 1944   the governments of iceland have always been coalition governments  with two or more parties involved  as no single political party has ever received a majority of seats in the althing throughout the republican period  the extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars which    in iceland  several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers  but other provisions and traditions suggest differently  citation needed  in 1980  icelanders elected vigd xeds finnbogad xf3ttir as president  the world s first directly elected female head of state  she retired from office in 1996  in 2009  iceland became the first country with an openly gay head of government when j xf3hanna sigur xf0ard xf3ttir became prime minister  86   iceland is divided into regions  constituencies and municipalities  the eight regions are primarily used for statistical purposes  district court jurisdictions also use an older version of this division  49  until 2003  the constituencies for the parliamentary elections were the same as the regions  but by an amendment to the constitution  they were changed to the current six constituencies   the redistricting change was made to balance the weight of different districts of the country  since previously a vote cast in the sparsely populated areas around the country would count much more than a vote cast in the reykjav xedk city area  the imbalance between districts has been reduced by the new system  but still exists  49   74 municipalities in iceland govern local matters like schools  transport  and zoning  87  these are the actual second-level subdivisions of iceland  as the constituencies have no relevance except in elections and for statistical purposes  reykjav xedk is by far the most populous municipality  about four times more populous than k xf3pavogur  the second one  49   regions of iceland  constituencies of iceland  municipalities of iceland  iceland  which is a member of the un  nato  efta  council of europe and oecd  maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations  but its ties with the nordic countries  germany  the united states  canada and the other nato nations are particularly close  historically  due to cultural  economic and linguistic similarities  iceland is a nordic country  and it participates in intergovernmental cooperation through the nordic council   iceland is a member of the european economic area  eea   which allows the country access to the single market of the european union  eu   it was not a member of the eu  but in july 2009 the icelandic parliament  the althing  voted in favour of application for eu membership 88  and officially applied on 17 july 2009.[89  however  in 2013  opinion polls showed that many icelanders were now against joining the eu  following 2013 elections the two parties that formed the island s new government \u2013 the centrist progressive party and the right-wing independence party \u2013 announced they would hold a referendum on eu membership  90   iceland has no standing army  but the icelandic coast guard which also maintains the iceland air defence system  and a iceland crisis response unit to support peacekeeping missions
