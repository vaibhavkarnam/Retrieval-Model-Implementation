Coolingtower
 a cooling tower is a heat rejection device that rejects waste heat to the atmosphere through the cooling of a water stream to a lower temperature  cooling towers may either use the evaporation of water to remove process heat and cool the working fluid to near the wet-bulb air temperature or  in the case of closed circuit dry cooling towers  rely solely on air to cool the working fluid to near the dry-bulb air temperature   common applications include cooling the circulating water used in oil refineries  petrochemical and other chemical plants  thermal power stations and hvac systems for cooling buildings  the classification is based on the type of air induction into the tower  the main types of cooling towers are natural draft and induced draft cooling towers   cooling towers vary in size from small roof-top units to very large hyperboloid structures  as in the adjacent image  that can be up to 200 metres (660\xa0ft  tall and 100 metres (330\xa0ft  in diameter  or rectangular structures that can be over 40 metres (130\xa0ft  tall and 80 metres (260\xa0ft  long  the hyperboloid cooling towers are often associated with nuclear power plants  1  although they are also used in some coal-fired plants and to some extent in some large chemical and other industrial plants  although these large towers are very prominent  the vast majority of cooling towers are much smaller  including many units installed on or near buildings to discharge heat from air conditioning       cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of condensers for use with the steam engine  2  condensers use relatively cool water  via various means  to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines  this reduces the back pressure  which in turn reduces the steam consumption  and thus the fuel consumption  while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler-water  3  however the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water  without which they are impractical  4][5  the consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040\u20132069.[6  while water usage is not an issue with marine engines  it forms a significant limitation for many land-based systems   by the turn of the 20th century  several evaporative methods of recycling cooling water were in use in areas lacking an established water supply  as well as in urban locations where municipal water mains may not be of sufficient supply  reliable in times of demand  or otherwise adequate to meet cooling needs  2][5  in areas with available land  the systems took the form of cooling ponds  in areas with limited land  such as in cities  they took the form of cooling towers  4][7   these early towers were positioned either on the rooftops of buildings or as free-standing structures  supplied with air by fans or relying on natural airflow  4][7  an american engineering textbook from 1911 described one design as  a circular or rectangular shell of light plate u2014in effect  a chimney stack much shortened vertically (20 to 40 ft  high  and very much enlarged laterally  at the top is a set of distributing troughs  to which the water from the condenser must be pumped  from these it trickles down over  mats  made of wooden slats or woven wire screens  which fill the space within the tower   7   a hyperboloid cooling tower was patented by the dutch engineers frederik van iterson and gerard kuypers in 1918.[8  the first hyperboloid cooling towers were built in 1918 near heerlen  the first ones in the united kingdom were built in 1924 at lister drive power station in liverpool  england  to cool water used at a coal-fired electrical power station  9   an hvac  heating  ventilating  and air conditioning  cooling tower is used to dispose of   reject   unwanted heat from a chiller  water-cooled chillers are normally more energy efficient than air-cooled chillers due to heat rejection to tower water at or near wet-bulb temperatures  air-cooled chillers must reject heat at the higher dry-bulb temperature  and thus have a lower average reverse-carnot cycle effectiveness  in areas with a hot climate  large office buildings  hospitals  and schools typically use one or more cooling towers as part of their air conditioning systems  generally  industrial cooling towers are much larger than hvac towers   hvac use of a cooling tower pairs the cooling tower with a water-cooled chiller or water-cooled condenser  a ton of air-conditioning is defined as the removal of 12,000 btu hour (3500 w   the equivalent ton on the cooling tower side actually rejects about 15,000 btu hour (4400 w  due to the additional waste heat-equivalent of the energy needed to drive the chiller s compressor  this equivalent ton is defined as the heat rejection in cooling 3 us gallons minute (1,500 pound hour  of water 10\xa0\xb0f (6\xa0\xb0c   which amounts to 15,000 btu hour  assuming a chiller coefficient of performance  cop  of 4.0.[10  this cop is equivalent to an energy efficiency ratio  eer  of 14   cooling towers are also used in hvac systems that have multiple water source heat pumps that share a common piping water loop  in this type of system  the water circulating inside the water loop removes heat from the condenser of the heat pumps whenever the heat pumps are working in the cooling mode  then the externally mounted cooling tower is used to remove heat from the water loop and reject it to the atmosphere  by contrast  when the heat pumps are working in heating mode  the condensers draw heat out of the loop water and reject it into the space to be heated  when the water loop is being used primarily to supply heat to the building  the cooling tower is normally shut down  and may be drained or winterized to prevent freeze damage   and heat is supplied by other means  usually from separate boilers   industrial cooling towers can be used to remove heat from various sources such as machinery or heated process material  the primary use of large  industrial cooling towers is to remove the heat absorbed in the circulating cooling water systems used in power plants  petroleum refineries  petrochemical plants  natural gas processing plants  food processing plants  semi-conductor plants  and for other industrial facilities such as in condensers of distillation columns  for cooling liquid in crystallization  etc  11  the circulation rate of cooling water in a typical 700 mw coal-fired power plant with a cooling tower amounts to about 71,600 cubic metres an hour (315,000 us gallons per minute  12  and the circulating water requires a supply water make-up rate of perhaps 5 percent  i e   3,600 cubic metres an hour    if that same plant had no cooling tower and used once-through cooling water  it would require about 100,000 cubic metres an hour 13  and that amount of water would have to be continuously returned to the ocean  lake or river from which it was obtained and continuously re-supplied to the plant  furthermore  discharging large amounts of hot water may raise the temperature of the receiving river or lake to an unacceptable level for the local ecosystem  elevated water temperatures can kill fish and other aquatic organisms  see thermal pollution   or can also cause an increase in undesirable organisms such as invasive species of zebra mussels or algae  a cooling tower serves to dissipate the heat into the atmosphere instead and wind and air diffusion spreads the heat over a much larger area than hot water can distribute heat in a body of water  evaporative cooling water cannot be used for subsequent purposes  other than rain somewhere   whereas surface-only cooling water can be re-used  some coal-fired and nuclear power plants located in coastal areas do make use of once-through ocean water  but even there  the offshore discharge water outlet requires very careful design to avoid environmental problems   petroleum refineries also have very large cooling tower systems  a typical large refinery processing 40,000 metric tonnes of crude oil per day (300,000 barrels (48,000\xa0m3  per day  circulates about 80,000 cubic metres of water per hour through its cooling tower system   the world s tallest cooling tower is the 202 metres (663\xa0ft  tall cooling tower of kalisindh thermal power station in jhalawar  rajasthan  india  14   these types of cooling towers are factory preassembled  and can be simply transported on trucks  as they are compact machines  the capacity of package type towers is limited and  for that reason  they are usually preferred by facilities with low heat rejection requirements such as food processing plants  textile plants  some chemical processing plants  or buildings like hospitals  hotels  malls  automotive factories etc   due to their frequent use in or near residential areas  sound level control is a relatively more important issue for package type cooling towers   facilities such as power plants  steel processing plants  petroleum refineries  or petrochemical plants usually install field erected type cooling towers due to their greater capacity for heat rejection  field erected towers are usually much larger in size compared to the package type cooling towers   a typical field erected cooling tower has a pultruded fiber-reinforced plastic  frp  structure  frp cladding  a mechanical unit for air draft  drift eliminator  and fill   with respect to the heat transfer mechanism employed  the main types are   in a wet cooling tower  or open circuit cooling tower   the warm water can be cooled to a temperature lower than the ambient air dry-bulb temperature  if the air is relatively dry  see dew point and psychrometrics   as ambient air is drawn past a flow of water  a small portion of the water evaporates  and the energy required to evaporate that portion of the water is taken from the remaining mass of water  thus reducing its temperature  approximately 970 btu of heat energy is absorbed for each pound of evaporated water (2 mj kg   evaporation results in saturated air conditions  lowering the temperature of the water processed by the tower to a value close to wet-bulb temperature  which is lower than the ambient dry-bulb temperature  the difference determined by the initial humidity of the ambient air   to achieve better performance  more cooling   a medium called fill is used to increase the surface area and the time of contact between the air and water flows  splash fill consists of material placed to interrupt the water flow causing splashing  film fill is composed of thin sheets of material  usually pvc  upon which the water flows  both methods create increased surface area and time of contact between the fluid  water  and the gas  air   to improve heat transfer   with respect to drawing air through the tower  there are three types of cooling towers   hyperboloid  sometimes incorrectly known as hyperbolic  cooling towers have become the design standard for all natural-draft cooling towers because of their structural strength and minimum usage of material  the hyperboloid shape also aids in accelerating the upward convective air flow  improving cooling efficiency  these designs are popularly associated with nuclear power plants  however  this association is misleading  as the same kind of cooling towers are often used at large coal-fired power plants as well  conversely  not all nuclear power plants have cooling towers  and some instead cool their heat exchangers with lake  river or ocean water   typically lower initial and long-term cost  mostly due to pump requirements   crossflow is a design in which the air flow is directed perpendicular to the water flow  see diagram at left   air flow enters one or more vertical faces of the cooling tower to meet the fill material  water flows  perpendicular to the air  through the fill by gravity  the air continues through the fill and thus past the water flow into an open plenum volume  lastly  a fan forces the air out into the atmosphere   a distribution or hot water basin consisting of a deep pan with holes or nozzles in its bottom is located near the top of a crossflow tower  gravity distributes the water through the nozzles uniformly across the fill material   advantages of the crossflow design   disadvantages of the crossflow design   in a counterflow design  the air flow is directly opposite to the water flow  see diagram at left   air flow first enters an open area beneath the fill media  and is then drawn up vertically  the water is sprayed through pressurized nozzles near the top of the tower  and then flows downward through the fill  opposite to the air flow    nadvantages of the counterflow design    ndisadvantages of the counterflow design   common aspects of both designs   both crossflow and counterflow designs can be used in natural draft and in mechanical draft cooling towers   quantitatively  the material balance around a wet  evaporative cooling tower system is governed by the operational variables of make-up flow rate  evaporation and windage losses  draw-off rate  and the concentration cycles  15][16   in the adjacent diagram  water pumped from the tower basin is the cooling water routed through the process coolers and condensers in an industrial facility  the cool water absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed  and the absorbed heat warms the circulating water  c   the warm water returns to the top of the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower  as it trickles down  it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower  that contact causes a small amount of the water to be lost as windage drift  w  and some of the water  e  to evaporate  the heat required to evaporate the water is derived from the water itself  which cools the water back to the original basin water temperature and the water is then ready to recirculate  the evaporated water leaves its dissolved salts behind in the bulk of the water which has not been evaporated  thus raising the salt concentration in the circulating cooling water  to prevent the salt concentration of the water from becoming too high  a portion of the water is drawn off blown down  d  for disposal  fresh water make-up  m  is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated water  the windage loss water and the draw-off water   using these flow rates and concentration dimensional units   a water balance around the entire system is then  16   since the evaporated water  e  has no salts  a chloride balance around the system is  16   and  therefore  16   from a simplified heat balance around the cooling tower   windage  or drift  losses  w  is the amount of total tower water flow that is entrained in the flow of air to the atmosphere  from large-scale industrial cooling towers  in the absence of manufacturer s data  it may be assumed to be   cycle of concentration represents the accumulation of dissolved minerals in the recirculating cooling water  discharge of draw-off  or blowdown  is used principally to control the buildup of these minerals   the chemistry of the make-up water  including the amount of dissolved minerals  can vary widely  make-up waters low in dissolved minerals such as those from surface water supplies  lakes  rivers etc   tend to be aggressive to metals  corrosive   make-up waters from ground water supplies  such as wells  are usually higher in minerals  and tend to be scaling  deposit minerals   increasing the amount of minerals present in the water by cycling can make water less aggressive to piping  however  excessive levels of minerals can cause scaling problems   as the cycles of concentration increase  the water may not be able to hold the minerals in solution  when the solubility of these minerals have been exceeded they can precipitate out as mineral solids and cause fouling and heat exchange problems in the cooling tower or the heat exchangers  the temperatures of the recirculating water  piping and heat exchange surfaces determine if and where minerals will precipitate from the recirculating water  often a professional water treatment consultant will evaluate the make-up water and the operating conditions of the cooling tower and recommend an appropriate range for the cycles of concentration  the use of water treatment chemicals  pretreatment such as water softening  ph adjustment  and other techniques can affect the acceptable range of cycles of concentration   concentration cycles in the majority of cooling towers usually range from 3 to 7  in the united states  many water supplies use well water which has significant levels of dissolved solids  on the other hand  one of the largest water supplies  for new york city  has a surface rainwater source quite low in minerals  thus cooling towers in that city are often allowed to concentrate to 7 or more cycles of concentration   since higher cycles of concentration represent less make-up water  water conservation efforts may focus on increasing cycles of concentration  17  highly treated recycled water may be an effective means of reducing cooling tower consumption of potable water  in regions where potable water is scarce  18   besides treating the circulating cooling water in large industrial cooling tower systems to minimize scaling and fouling  the water should be filtered to remove particulates  and also be dosed with biocides and algaecides to prevent growths that could interfere with the continuous flow of the water  15  under certain conditions  a biofilm of micro-organisms such as bacteria  fungi and algae can grow very rapidly in the cooling water  and can reduce the heat transfer efficiency of the cooling tower  biofilm can be reduced or prevented by using chlorine or other chemicals  a normal industrial practice is to use two biocides  such as oxidizing and non-oxidizing types to complement each other s strengths and weaknesses  and to ensure a broader spectrum of attack  in most cases  a continual low level oxidizing biocide is used  then alternating to a periodic shock dose of non-oxidizing biocides  20   another very important reason for using biocides in cooling towers is to prevent the growth of legionella  including species that cause legionellosis or legionnaires  disease  most notably l  pneumophila  21  or mycobacterium avium  22  the various legionella species are the cause of legionnaires  disease in humans and transmission is via exposure to aerosols u2014the inhalation of mist droplets containing the bacteria  common sources of legionella include cooling towers used in open recirculating evaporative cooling water systems  domestic hot water systems  fountains  and similar disseminators that tap into a public water supply  natural sources include freshwater ponds and creeks   french researchers found that legionella bacteria travelled up to 6 kilometres (3.7\xa0mi  through the air from a large contaminated cooling tower at a petrochemical plant in pas-de-calais  france  that outbreak killed 21 of the 86 people who had a laboratory-confirmed infection  23   drift  or windage  is the term for water droplets of the process flow allowed to escape in the cooling tower discharge  drift eliminators are used in order to hold drift rates typically to 0.001\u20130.005  of the circulating flow rate  a typical drift eliminator provides multiple directional changes of airflow to prevent the escape of water droplets  a well-designed and well-fitted drift eliminator can greatly reduce water loss and potential for legionella or water treatment chemical exposure   the cdc does not recommend that health-care facilities regularly test for the legionella pneumophila bacteria  scheduled microbiologic monitoring for legionella remains controversial because its presence is not necessarily evidence of a potential for causing disease  the cdc recommends aggressive disinfection measures for cleaning and maintaining devices known to transmit legionella  but does not recommend regularly-scheduled microbiologic assays for the bacteria  however  scheduled monitoring of potable water within a hospital might be considered in certain settings where persons are highly susceptible to illness and mortality from legionella infection  e g  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation units  or solid organ transplant units   also  after an outbreak of legionellosis  health officials agree that monitoring is necessary to identify the source and to evaluate the efficacy of biocides or other prevention measures  24   studies have found legionella in 40  to 60  of cooling towers  25   many governmental agencies  cooling tower manufacturers and industrial trade organizations have developed design and maintenance guidelines for preventing or controlling the growth of legionella in cooling towers  below is a list of sources for such guidelines   under certain ambient conditions  plumes of water vapor  fog  can be seen rising out of the discharge from a cooling tower  and can be mistaken as smoke from a fire  if the outdoor air is at or near saturation  and the tower adds more water to the air  saturated air with liquid water droplets can be discharged  which is seen as fog  this phenomenon typically occurs on cool  humid days  but is rare in many climates   this phenomenon can be prevented by decreasing the relative humidity of the saturated discharge air  for that purpose  in hybrid towers  saturated discharge air is mixed with heated low relative humidity air  some air enters the tower above drift eliminator level  passing through heat exchangers  the relative humidity of the dry air is even more decreased instantly as being heated while entering the tower  the discharged mixture has a relatively lower relative humidity and the fog is invisible   when wet cooling towers with seawater make-up are installed in various industries located in or near coastal areas  the drift of fine droplets emitted from the cooling towers contain nearly 6  sodium chloride which deposits on the nearby land areas  this deposition of sodium salts on the nearby agriculture vegetative lands can convert them into sodic saline or sodic alkaline soils depending on the nature of the soil and enhance the sodicity of ground and surface water  the salt deposition problem from such cooling towers aggravates where national pollution control standards are not imposed or not implemented to minimize the drift emissions from wet cooling towers using seawater make-up  29   respirable suspended particulate matter  of less than 10 micrometers (\xb5m  in size  can be present in the drift from cooling towers  larger particles above 10\xa0\xb5m in size are generally filtered out in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than 10\xa0\xb5m  referred to as pm10  can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems  similarly  particles smaller than 2.5\xa0\xb5m  (pm2.5   tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung  and very small particles  less than 100 nanometers  may pass through the lungs to affect other organs  though the total particulate emissions from wet cooling towers with fresh water make-up is much less  they contain more pm10 and pm2.5 than the total emissions from wet cooling towers with sea water make-up  this is due to lesser salt content in fresh water drift  below 2,000\xa0ppm  compared to the salt content of sea water drift (60,000\xa0ppm   29   at some modern power stations equipped with flue gas purification  such as the gro xdfkrotzenburg power station and the rostock power station  the cooling tower is also used as a flue-gas stack  industrial chimney   thus saving the cost of a separate chimney structure  at plants without flue gas purification  problems with corrosion may occur  due to reactions of raw flue gas with water to form acids   sometimes  natural draft cooling towers are constructed with structural steel in place of concrete  rcc  when the construction time of natural draft cooling tower is exceeding the construction time of the rest of the plant or the local soil is of poor strength to bear the heavy weight of rcc cooling towers or cement prices are higher at a site to opt for cheaper natural draft cooling towers made of structural steel   some cooling towers  such as smaller building air conditioning systems  are shut down seasonally  drained  and winterized to prevent freeze damage   during the winter  other sites continuously operate cooling towers with 40\xa0\xb0f (4\xa0\xb0c  water leaving the tower  basin heaters  tower draindown  and other freeze protection methods are often employed in cold climates  operational cooling towers with malfunctions can freeze during very cold weather  typically  freezing starts at the corners of a cooling tower with a reduced or absent heat load  severe freezing conditions can create growing volumes of ice  resulting in increased structural loads which can cause structural damage or collapse   to prevent freezing  the following procedures are used   cooling towers constructed in whole or in part of combustible materials can support internal fire propagation  such fires can become very intense  due to the high surface-volume ratio of the towers  and fires can be further intensified by natural convection or fan-assisted draft  the resulting damage can be sufficiently severe to require the replacement of the entire cell or tower structure  for this reason  some codes and standards 32  recommend that combustible cooling towers be provided with an automatic fire sprinkler system  fires can propagate internally within the tower structure when the cell is not in operation  such as for maintenance or construction   and even while the tower is in operation  especially those of the induced-draft type  because of the existence of relatively dry areas within the towers  33   being very large structures  cooling towers are susceptible to wind damage  and several spectacular failures have occurred in the past  at ferrybridge power station on 1 november 1965  the station was the site of a major structural failure  when three of the cooling towers collapsed owing to vibrations in 85\xa0mph (137\xa0km h  winds  although the structures had been built to withstand higher wind speeds  the shape of the cooling towers caused westerly winds to be funnelled into the towers themselves  creating a vortex  three out of the original eight cooling towers were destroyed  and the remaining five were severely damaged  the towers were later rebuilt and all eight cooling towers were strengthened to tolerate adverse weather conditions  building codes were changed to include improved structural support  and wind tunnel tests were introduced to check tower structures and configuration
