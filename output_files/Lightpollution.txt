Lightpollution
 light pollution  also known as photopollution  is excessive  misdirected or obtrusive artificial light  as a major side-effect of urbanization  it is blamed for compromising health  disrupting ecosystems and spoiling aesthetic environments       light pollution is the adding-of added light itself  in analogy to added sound  carbon dioxide  etc  adverse consequences are multiple  some of them may not be known yet  scientific definitions thus include the following   the first three of the above four scientific definitions describe the state of the environment  the fourth  and newest  one describes the process of polluting by light   light pollution competes with starlight in the night sky for urban residents  interferes with astronomical observatories  5  and  like any other form of pollution  disrupts ecosystems and has adverse health effects   light pollution is a side effect of industrial civilization  its sources include building exterior and interior lighting  advertising  commercial properties  offices  factories  streetlights  and illuminated sporting venues  it is most severe in highly industrialized  densely populated areas of north america  europe  and japan and in major cities in the middle east and north africa like tehran and cairo  but even relatively small amounts of light can be noticed and create problems  since the early 1980s  citation needed  a global dark-sky movement has emerged  with concerned people campaigning to reduce the amount of light pollution  the international dark-sky association  ida  is one non-profit advocacy group involved in this movement   energy conservation advocates contend that light pollution must be addressed by changing the habits of society  so that lighting is used more efficiently  with less waste and less creation of unwanted or unneeded illumination  several industry groups also recognize light pollution as an important issue  for example  the institution of lighting engineers in the united kingdom provides its members with information about light pollution  the problems it causes  and how to reduce its impact  6   since not everyone is irritated by the same lighting sources  it is common for one person s light  pollution  to be light that is desirable for another  one example of this is found in advertising  when an advertiser wishes for particular lights to be bright and visible  even though others find them annoying  other types of light pollution are more certain  for instance  light that accidentally crosses a property boundary and annoys a neighbor is generally wasted and pollutive light   disputes are still common when deciding appropriate action  and differences in opinion over what light is considered reasonable  and who should be responsible  mean that negotiation must sometimes take place between parties  where objective measurement is desired  light levels can be quantified by field measurement or mathematical modeling  with results typically displayed as an isophote map or light contour map  authorities have also taken a variety of measures for dealing with light pollution  depending on the interests  beliefs and understandings of the society involved  measures range from doing nothing at all  to implementing strict laws and regulations about how lights may be installed and used   light pollution is a broad term that refers to multiple problems  all of which are caused by inefficient  unappealing  or  arguably  unnecessary use of artificial light  specific categories of light pollution include light trespass  over-illumination  glare  light clutter  and skyglow  a single offending light source often falls into more than one of these categories   light trespass occurs when unwanted light enters one s property  for instance  by shining over a neighbor s fence  a common light trespass problem occurs when a strong light enters the window of one s home from the outside  causing problems such as sleep deprivation  a number of cities in the u s  have developed standards for outdoor lighting to protect the rights of their citizens against light trespass  to assist them  the international dark-sky association has developed a set of model lighting ordinances  7   the dark-sky association was started to reduce the light going up into the sky which reduces visibility of stars  see skyglow below   this is any light which is emitted more than 90\xb0 above nadir  by limiting light at this 90\xb0 mark they have also reduced the light output in the 80\u201390\xb0 range which creates most of the light trespass issues   u s  federal agencies may also enforce standards and process complaints within their areas of jurisdiction  for instance  in the case of light trespass by white strobe lighting from communication towers in excess of faa minimum lighting requirements 8  the federal communications commission maintains an antenna structure registration database 9  information which citizens may use to identify offending structures and provides a mechanism for processing citizen inquiries and complaints  10  the u s  green building council  usgbc  has also incorporated a credit for reducing the amount of light trespass and sky glow into their environmentally friendly building standard known as leed   light trespass can be reduced by selecting light fixtures which limit the amount of light emitted more than 80\xb0 above the nadir  the iesna definitions include full cutoff (0    cutoff (10    and semi-cutoff (20     these definitions also include limits on light emitted above 90\xb0 to reduce sky glow    over-illumination is the excessive use of light  specifically within the united states  over-illumination is responsible for approximately two million barrels of oil per day in energy wasted  citation needed  this is based upon u s  consumption of equivalent of 18.8 million barrels per day (2,990,000\xa0m3 d  of petroleum  11  it is further noted in the same u s  department of energy source that over 30  of all primary energy is consumed by commercial  industrial and residential sectors  energy audits of existing buildings demonstrate that the lighting component of residential  commercial and industrial uses consumes about 20\u201340  of those land uses  variable with region and land use   residential use lighting consumes only 10\u201330  of the energy bill while commercial buildings  major use is lighting  12   thus lighting energy accounts for about four or five million barrels of oil  equivalent  per day  again energy audit data demonstrates that about 30\u201360  of energy consumed in lighting is unneeded or gratuitous  13   an alternative calculation starts with the fact that commercial building lighting consumes in excess of 81.68 terawatts (1999 data  of electricity  14  according to the u s  doe  thus commercial lighting alone consumes about four to five million barrels per day  equivalent  of petroleum  in line with the alternate rationale above to estimate u s  lighting energy consumption  even among developed countries there are large differences in patterns of light use  american cities emit 3\u20135 times more light to space per capita compared to german cities  15   over-illumination stems from several factors   most of these issues can be readily corrected with available  inexpensive technology  and with resolution of landlord tenant practices that create barriers to rapid correction of these matters  most importantly  public awareness would need to improve for industrialized countries to realize the large payoff in reducing over-illumination   in certain cases an over-illumination lighting technique may be needed  for example  indirect lighting is often used to obtain a  softer  look  since hard direct lighting is generally found less desirable for certain surfaces  such as skin  the indirect lighting method is perceived as more cozy and suits bars  restaurants and living quarters  it is also possible to block the direct lighting effect by adding softening filters or other solutions  though intensity will be reduced   glare can be categorized into different types  one such classification is described in a book by bob mizon  coordinator for the british astronomical association s campaign for dark skies  as follows  17   according to mario motta  president of the massachusetts medical society       glare from bad lighting is a public-health hazard u2014especially the older you become  glare light scattering in the eye causes loss of contrast and leads to unsafe driving conditions  much like the glare on a dirty windshield from low-angle sunlight or the high beams from an oncoming car   18  in essence bright and or badly shielded lights around roads can partially blind drivers or pedestrians and contribute to accidents   the blinding effect is caused in large part by reduced contrast due to light scattering in the eye by excessive brightness  or to reflection of light from dark areas in the field of vision  with luminance similar to the background luminance  this kind of glare is a particular instance of disability glare  called veiling glare   this is not the same as loss of accommodation of night vision which is caused by the direct effect of the light itself on the eye    light clutter refers to excessive groupings of lights  groupings of lights may generate confusion  distract from obstacles  including those that they may be intended to illuminate   and potentially cause accidents  clutter is particularly noticeable on roads where the street lights are badly designed  or where brightly lit advertising surrounds the roadways  depending on the motives of the person or organization that installed the lights  their placement and design can even be intended to distract drivers  and can contribute to accidents   clutter may also present a hazard in the aviation environment if aviation safety lighting must compete for pilot attention with non-relevant lighting  19  for instance  runway lighting may be confused with an array of suburban commercial lighting and aircraft collision avoidance lights may be confused with ground lights   skyglow refers to the diffuse glow that can be seen over populated areas  it arises from light reflected from illuminated surfaces and from light escaping directly upward from incompletely shielded or upward-directed light fixtures  which then is scattered  redirected  by the atmosphere back toward the ground  the brightness of skyglow is affected strongly by the amount of light used  the shielding characteristics of the light fixtures  and by the color or spectral content of the light sources  though it is commonly thought that rayleigh scattering strongly increases the brightness of skyglow arising from white sources with strong blue and green emission  the dominant spectral effect has been shown to arise from the purkinje effect instead  20][21][22  because of the eye s increased sensitivity to blue and green light when adapted to very low luminance levels  such as those in even moderately polluted clear night skies   white light sources such as white leds contribute significantly more to skyglow than an equal amount of yellow light from sources such as high-pressure sodium  low-pressure sodium   phosphor-converted   pc  amber led  or  narrow spectrum  amber algainp leds  sky glow is of particular irritation to astronomers  as it interferes with astronomical observations  but multitudes suffer from the decreased visibility of star-filled night skies   skyglow brightness can be measured with instruments such as the sky quality meters  sqm   or visually using the bortle dark-sky scale  23][24  the nine-class bortle scale rates the darkness of the night sky and the visibility of its phenomena  such as the milky way  gegenschein and the zodiacal light  easily masked by skyglow   providing a detailed description of each level on the scale  with class 1 being the best    light is particularly problematic for amateur astronomers  whose ability to observe the night sky from their property is inhibited by any stray light from nearby  most major optical astronomical observatories are surrounded by zones of strictly enforced restrictions on light emissions to limit skyglow   direct skyglow is reduced by selecting lighting fixtures which limit the amount of light emitted above the horizontal (90\xb0 above the nadir   indirect skyglow produced by reflections from illuminated surfaces is harder to manage  effective methods for limiting it include the use of low-impact lamp types  e g  amber sources  see above   minimizing over-illumination and inefficient designs or fixtures that spread light where it is not needed  but it has to be taken into account that  according to late 2010 publications  italian regions using full cut off lighting only does not increase skyglow  25  anyway  light reflected upwards by dark surfaces such as roads or buildings can be considered as minor  so debate about the contribution of indirect skyglow will continue   skyglow is made considerably worse when clouds are present  26  while this has no effect on astronomical observations  which are not possible at visible wavelengths under cloud cover   it is very important in the context of ecological light pollution  since cloudy nights in artificially lit areas can be up to ten thousand times brighter than in natural areas  27  any organisms that are affected by sky glow  e g  zooplankton and fish that visually prey on them  are much more likely to have their ordinary behavior disturbed on cloudy nights   impacts of skyglow are explored in the photography and timelapse project skyglow  created in collaboration with international dark-sky association   measuring the effect of sky glow on a global scale is a complex procedure  the natural atmosphere is not completely dark  even in the absence of terrestrial sources of light and illumination from the moon  this is caused by two main sources  airglow and scattered light   at high altitudes  primarily above the mesosphere  there is enough uv radiation from the sun of very short wavelength to cause ionization  when the ions collide with electrically neutral particles they recombine and emit photons in the process  causing airglow  the degree of ionization is sufficiently large to allow a constant emission of radiation even during the night when the upper atmosphere is in the earth s shadow  lower in the atmosphere all of the solar photons with energies above the ionization potential of n2 and o2 have already been absorbed by the higher layers and thus no appreciable ionization occurs   apart from emitting light  the sky also scatters incoming light  primarily from distant stars and the milky way  but also the zodiacal light  sunlight that is reflected and backscattered from interplanetary dust particles   the amount of airglow and zodiacal light is quite variable  depending  amongst other things on sunspot activity and the solar cycle  but given optimal conditions the darkest possible sky has a brightness of about 22 magnitude square arcsecond  if a full moon is present  the sky brightness increases to about 18 magnitude sq  arcsecond depending on local atmospheric transparency  40 times brighter than the darkest sky  in densely populated areas a sky brightness of 17 magnitude sq  arcsecond is not uncommon  or as much as 100 times brighter than is natural   to precisely measure how bright the sky gets  night time satellite imagery of the earth is used as raw input for the number and intensity of light sources  these are put into a physical model 28  of scattering due to air molecules and aerosoles to calculate cumulative sky brightness  maps that show the enhanced sky brightness have been prepared for the entire world  29   inspection of the area surrounding madrid reveals that the effects of light pollution caused by a single large conglomeration can be felt up to 100\xa0km (62\xa0mi  away from the center  30  global effects of light pollution are also made obvious  the entire area consisting of southern england  netherlands  belgium  west germany  and northern france have a sky brightness of at least 2 to 4 times above normal  see above right   the only places in continental europe where the sky can attain its natural darkness are in northern scandinavia and in islands far from the continent   in north america the situation is comparable  there is a significant problem with light pollution ranging from the canadian maritime provinces to the american southwest  30  the international dark-sky association works to designate areas that have high quality night skies  these areas are supported by communities and organizations that are dedicated to reducing light pollution  e g dark-sky preserve   the national park service natural sounds and night skies division has measured night sky quality in national park units across the u s  sky quality in the u s  ranges from pristine  capitol reef national park and big bend national park  to severely degraded  santa monica mountains national recreation area and biscayne national park   31  the national park service night sky program monitoring database is available online (2015).[32   light pollution in hong kong was declared the  worst on the planet  in march 2013.[33   in june 2016  it was estimated that one third of the world s population could no longer see the milky way  including 80  of americans and 60  of europeans  singapore was found to be the most light-polluted country in the world  34][30   lighting is responsible for one-fourth of all electricity consumption worldwide  citation needed  and case studies have shown that several forms of over-illumination constitute energy wastage  including non-beneficial upward direction of night-time lighting  in 2007  terna  the company responsible for managing electricity flow in italy  reported a saving of 645.2 million kwh in electricity consumption during the daylight saving period from april to october  it attributes this saving to the delayed need for artificial lighting during the evenings   in australia   ...\xa0public lighting is the single largest source of local government s greenhouse gas emissions  typically accounting for 30 to 50  of their emissions  there are 1.94 million public lights xa0\u2014 one for every 10 australians xa0\u2014 that annually cost a 210 million  use 1,035 gwh of electricity and are responsible for 1.15 million tonnes of co2 emissions   current public lighting in australia  particularly for minor roads and streets  uses large amounts of energy and financial resources  while often failing to provide high quality lighting  there are many ways to improve lighting quality while reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions as well as lowering costs  35   medical research on the effects of excessive light on the human body suggests that a variety of adverse health effects may be caused by light pollution or excessive light exposure  and some lighting design textbooks 36  use human health as an explicit criterion for proper interior lighting  health effects of over-illumination or improper spectral composition of light may include  increased headache incidence  worker fatigue  medically defined stress  decrease in sexual function and increase in anxiety  37][38][39][40  likewise  animal models have been studied demonstrating unavoidable light to produce adverse effect on mood and anxiety  41  for those who need to be awake at night  light at night also has an acute effect on alertness and mood  42   in 2007   shift work that involves circadian disruption  was listed as a probable carcinogen by the world health organization s international agency for research on cancer   iarc press release no  180).[43][44  multiple studies have documented a correlation between night shift work and the increased incidence of breast and prostate cancer  45][46][47][48][49][50   a more recent discussion (2009   written by professor steven lockley  harvard medical school  can be found in the cfds handbook  blinded by the light    51  chapter 4   human health implications of light pollution  states that      light intrusion  even if dim  is likely to have measurable effects on sleep disruption and melatonin suppression  even if these effects are relatively small from night to night  continuous chronic circadian  sleep and hormonal disruption may have longer-term health risks   the new york academy of sciences hosted a meeting in 2009 on circadian disruption and cancer  52  red light suppresses melatonin the least  53   in june 2009  the american medical association developed a policy in support of control of light pollution  news about the decision emphasized glare as a public health hazard leading to unsafe driving conditions  especially in the elderly  glare produces loss of contrast  obscuring night vision  18   when artificial light affects organisms and ecosystems it is called ecological light pollution  while light at night can be beneficial  neutral  or damaging for individual species  its presence invariably disturbs ecosystems  for example  some species of spiders avoid lit areas  while other species are happy to build their spider web directly on a lamp post  since lamp posts attract many flying insects  the spiders that don t mind light gain an advantage over the spiders that avoid it  this is a simple example of the way in which species frequencies and food webs can be disturbed by the introduction of light at night   light pollution poses a serious threat in particular to nocturnal wildlife  having negative impacts on plant and animal physiology  it can confuse animal navigation  alter competitive interactions  change predator-prey relations  and cause physiological harm  54  the rhythm of life is orchestrated by the natural diurnal patterns of light and dark  so disruption to these patterns impacts the ecological dynamics  55   studies suggest that light pollution around lakes prevents zooplankton  such as daphnia  from eating surface algae  causing algal blooms that can kill off the lakes  plants and lower water quality  56  light pollution may also affect ecosystems in other ways  for example  lepidopterists and entomologists have documented that nighttime light may interfere with the ability of moths and other nocturnal insects to navigate  57  night-blooming flowers that depend on moths for pollination may be affected by night lighting  as there is no replacement pollinator that would not be affected by the artificial light  this can lead to species decline of plants that are unable to reproduce  and change an area s longterm ecology   a 2009 study 58  also suggests deleterious impacts on animals and ecosystems because of perturbation of polarized light or artificial polarization of light  even during the day  because direction of natural polarization of sun light and its reflexion is a source of information for a lot of animals   this form of pollution is named polarized light pollution  plp   unnatural polarized light sources can trigger maladaptive behaviors in polarization-sensitive taxa and alter ecological interactions  58   lights on tall structures can disorient migrating birds  estimates by the u s  fish and wildlife service of the number of birds killed after being attracted to tall towers range from 4 to 5 million per year to an order of magnitude higher  59  the fatal light awareness program  flap  works with building owners in toronto  canada and other cities to reduce mortality of birds by turning out lights during migration periods   similar disorientation has also been noted for bird species migrating close to offshore production and drilling facilities  studies carried out by nederlandse aardolie maatschappij b v   nam  and shell have led to development and trial of new lighting technologies in the north sea  in early 2007  the lights were installed on the shell production platform l15  the experiment proved a great success since the number of birds circling the platform declined by 50 to 90%.[60   sea turtle hatchlings emerging from nests on beaches are another casualty of light pollution  it is a common misconception that hatchling sea turtles are attracted to the moon  rather  they find the ocean by moving away from the dark silhouette of dunes and their vegetation  a behavior with which artificial lights interfere  61  the breeding activity and reproductive phenology of toads  however  are cued by moonlight  62  juvenile seabirds may also be disoriented by lights as they leave their nests and fly out to sea  63][64][65  amphibians and reptiles are also affected by light pollution  introduced light sources during normally dark periods can disrupt levels of melatonin production  melatonin is a hormone that regulates photoperiodic physiology and behaviour  some species of frogs and salamanders utilize a light-dependent  compass  to orient their migratory behaviour to breeding sites  introduced light can also cause developmental irregularities  such as retinal damage  reduced sperm production  and genetic mutation  54][66][67][68][69][70   in september 2009  the 9th european dark-sky symposium in armagh  northern ireland had a session on the environmental effects of light at night  lan   it dealt with bats  turtles  the  hidden  harms of lan  and many other topics  71  the environmental effects of lan were mentioned as early as 1897  in a los angeles times article  the following is an excerpt from that article  called  electricity and english songbirds    an english journal has become alarmed at the relation of electricity to songbirds  which it maintains is closer than that of cats and fodder crops  how many of us  it asks  foresee that electricity may extirpate the songbird    with the exception of the finches  all the english songbirds may be said to be insectivorous  and their diet consists chiefly of vast numbers of very small insects which they collect from the grass and herbs before the dew is dry  as the electric light is finding its way for street illumination into the country parts of england  these poor winged atoms are slain by thousands at each light every warm summer evening    the fear is expressed  that when england is lighted from one end to the other with electricity the song birds will die out from the failure of their food supply  72   astronomy is very sensitive to light pollution  the night sky viewed from a city bears no resemblance to what can be seen from dark skies  73  skyglow  the scattering of light in the atmosphere  reduces the contrast between stars and galaxies and the sky itself  making it much harder to see fainter objects  this is one factor that has caused newer telescopes to be built in increasingly remote areas  some astronomers use narrow-band  nebula filters  which only allow specific wavelengths of light commonly seen in nebulae  or broad-band  light pollution filters  which are designed to reduce  but not eliminate  the effects of light pollution by filtering out spectral lines commonly emitted by sodium- and mercury-vapor lamps  thus enhancing contrast and improving the view of dim objects such as galaxies and nebulae  74  unfortunately these light pollution reduction  lpr  filters are not a cure for light pollution  lpr filters reduce the brightness of the object under study and this limits the use of higher magnifications  lpr filters work by blocking light of certain wavelengths  which alters the color of the object  often creating a pronounced green cast  furthermore  lpr filters only work on certain object types  mainly emission nebulae  and are of little use on galaxies and stars  no filter can match the effectiveness of a dark sky for visual or photographic purposes  due to their low surface brightness  the visibility of diffuse sky objects such as nebulae and galaxies is affected by light pollution more than are stars  most such objects are rendered invisible in heavily light polluted skies around major cities  a simple method for estimating the darkness of a location is to look for the milky way  which from truly dark skies appears bright enough to cast a shadow  75   in addition to skyglow  light trespass can impact observations when artificial light directly enters the tube of the telescope and is reflected from non-optical surfaces until it eventually reaches the eyepiece  this direct form of light pollution causes a glow across the field of view which reduces contrast  light trespass also makes it hard for a visual observer to become sufficiently dark adapted  the usual measures to reduce this glare  if reducing the light directly is not an option  include flocking the telescope tube and accessories to reduce reflection  and putting a light shield  also usable as a dew shield  on the telescope to reduce light entering from angles other than those near the target  under these conditions  some astronomers prefer to observe under a black cloth to ensure maximum dark adaptation  in one italian regional lighting code this effect of stray light is defined as  optical pollution  citation needed   due to the fact that there is a direct path from the light source to the  optic  \u2013 the observer s eye or telescope   a study presented at the american geophysical union meeting in san francisco found that light pollution destroys nitrate radicals thus preventing the normal night time reduction of atmospheric smog produced by fumes emitted from cars and factories  77][78  the study was presented by harald stark from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration   in the night  the polarization of the moonlit sky is very strongly reduced in the presence of urban light pollution  because scattered urban light is not strongly polarized  79  polarized moonlight can t be seen by humans  but is believed to be used by many animals for navigation   reducing light pollution implies many things  such as reducing sky glow  reducing glare  reducing light trespass  and reducing clutter  the method for best reducing light pollution  therefore  depends on exactly what the problem is in any given instance  possible solutions include   the use of full cutoff lighting fixtures  as much as possible  is advocated by most campaigners for the reduction of light pollution  it is also commonly recommended that lights be spaced appropriately for maximum efficiency  and that number of luminaires being used as well as the wattage of each luminaire match the needs of the particular application  based on local lighting design standards    full cutoff fixtures first became available in 1959 with the introduction of general electric s m100 fixture  80   a full cutoff fixture  when correctly installed  reduces the chance for light to escape above the plane of the horizontal  light released above the horizontal may sometimes be lighting an intended target  but often serves no purpose  when it enters into the atmosphere  light contributes to sky glow  some governments and organizations are now considering  or have already implemented  full cutoff fixtures in street lamps and stadium lighting   the use of full cutoff fixtures help to reduce sky glow by preventing light from escaping above the horizontal  full cutoff typically reduces the visibility of the lamp and reflector within a luminaire  so the effects of glare are also reduced  campaigners also commonly argue that full cutoff fixtures are more efficient than other fixtures  since light that would otherwise have escaped into the atmosphere may instead be directed towards the ground  however  full cutoff fixtures may also trap more light in the fixture than other types of luminaires  corresponding to lower luminaire efficiency  suggesting a re-design of some luminaires may be necessary   the use of full cutoff fixtures can allow for lower wattage lamps to be used in the fixtures  producing the same or sometimes a better effect  due to being more carefully controlled  in every lighting system  some sky glow also results from light reflected from the ground  this reflection can be reduced  however  by being careful to use only the lowest wattage necessary for the lamp  and setting spacing between lights appropriately  81  assuring luminaire setback is greater than 90\xb0 from highly reflective surfaces also diminishes reflectance   a common criticism of full cutoff lighting fixtures is that they are sometimes not as aesthetically pleasing to look at  this is most likely because historically there has not been a large market specifically for full cutoff fixtures  and because people typically like to see the source of illumination  due to the specificity with their direction of light  full cutoff fixtures sometimes also require expertise to install for maximum effect   the effectiveness of using full cutoff roadway lights to combat light pollution has also been called into question  according to design investigations  luminaires with full cutoff distributions  as opposed to cutoff or semi cutoff  compared here 82   have to be closer together to meet the same light level  uniformity and glare requirements specified by the iesna  these simulations optimized the height and spacing of the lights while constraining the overall design to meet the iesna requirements  and then compared total uplight and energy consumption of different luminaire designs and powers  cutoff designs performed better than full cutoff designs  and semi-cutoff performed better than either cutoff or full cutoff  this indicates that  in roadway installations  over-illumination or poor uniformity produced by full cutoff fixtures may be more detrimental than direct uplight created by fewer cutoff or semi-cutoff fixtures  therefore  the overall performance of existing systems could be improved more by reducing the number of luminaires than by switching to full cutoff designs   however  using the definition of  light pollution  from some italian regional bills  i e    every irradiance of artificial light outside competence areas and particularly upward the sky   only full cutoff design prevents light pollution  the italian lombardy region  where only full cutoff design is allowed  lombardy act no  17/2000  promoted by cielobuio-coordination for the protection of the night sky   in 2007 had the lowest per capita energy consumption for public lighting in italy  the same legislation also imposes a minimum distance between street lamps of about four times their height  so full cut off street lamps are the best solution to reduce both light pollution and electrical power usage   several different types of light sources exist  each having different properties that affect their appropriateness for certain tasks  particularly efficiency and spectral power distribution  it is often the case that inappropriate light sources have been selected for a task  either due to ignorance or because more sophisticated light sources were unavailable at the time of installation  therefore  badly chosen light sources often contribute unnecessarily to light pollution and energy waste  by re-assessing and changing the light sources used  it is often possible to reduce energy use and pollutive effects while simultaneously greatly improving efficiency and visibility   some types of light sources are listed in order of energy efficiency in the table below  figures are approximate maintained values   and include relative visual skyglow impacts  20][21   many astronomers request that nearby communities use low pressure sodium lights or amber aluminium gallium indium phosphide led as much as possible  because the principal wavelength emitted is comparably easy to work around or in rare cases filter out  83  the low cost of operating sodium lights is another feature  in 1980  for example  san jose  california  replaced all street lamps with low pressure sodium lamps  whose light is easier for nearby lick observatory to filter out  similar programs are now in place in arizona and hawaii  such yellow light sources also have significantly less visual skyglow impact  22  so reduce visual sky brightness and improve star visibility for everyone   disadvantages of low pressure sodium lighting are that fixtures must usually be larger than competing fixtures  and that color cannot be distinguished  due to its emitting principally a single wavelength of light  see security lighting   due to the substantial size of the lamp  particularly in higher wattages such as 135 w and 180 w  control of light emissions from low pressure sodium luminaires is more difficult  for applications requiring more precise direction of light  such as narrow roadways  the native lamp efficacy advantage of this lamp type is decreased and may be entirely lost compared to high pressure sodium lamps  allegations that this also leads to higher amounts of light pollution from luminaires running these lamps arise principally because of older luminaires with poor shielding  still widely in use in the uk and in some other locations  modern low-pressure sodium fixtures with better optics and full shielding  and the decreased skyglow impacts of yellow light preserve the luminous efficacy advantage of low-pressure sodium and result in most cases is less energy consumption and less visible light pollution  unfortunately  due to continued lack of accurate information  84  many lighting professionals continue to disparage low-pressure sodium  contributing to its decreased acceptance and specification in lighting standards and therefore its use  another disadvantage of low-pressure sodium lamps is that some people find the characteristic yellow light very displeasing aesthetically  citation needed   because of the increased sensitivity of the human eye to blue and green wavelengths when viewing low-luminances  the purkinje effect  in the night sky  different sources produce dramatically different amounts of visible skyglow from the same amount of light sent into the atmosphere   in some cases  evaluation of existing plans has determined that more efficient lighting plans are possible  for instance  light pollution can be reduced by turning off unneeded outdoor lights  and only lighting stadiums when there are people inside  timers are especially valuable for this purpose  one of the world s first coordinated legislative efforts to reduce the adverse effect of this pollution on the environment began in flagstaff  arizona  in the u s  there  over three decades of ordinance development has taken place  with the full support of the population  85  often with government support  86  with community advocates  87  and with the help of major local observatories  88  including the united states naval observatory flagstaff station  each component helps to educate  protect and enforce the imperatives to intelligently reduce detrimental light pollution   one example of a lighting plan assessment can be seen in a report originally commissioned by the office of the deputy prime minister in the united kingdom  and now available through the department for communities and local government  89  the report details a plan to be implemented throughout the uk  for designing lighting schemes in the countryside  with a particular focus on preserving the environment   in another example  the city of calgary has recently replaced most residential street lights with models that are comparably energy efficient  90  the motivation is primarily operation cost and environmental conservation  the costs of installation are expected to be regained through energy savings within six to seven years   the swiss agency for energy efficiency  safe  uses a concept that promises to be of great use in the diagnosis and design of road lighting   consommation \xe9lectrique sp xe9cifique  ces    which can be translated into english as  specific electric power consumption (sec    91  thus  based on observed lighting levels in a wide range of swiss towns  safe has defined target values for electric power consumption per metre for roads of various categories  thus  safe currently recommends an sec of 2 to 3 watts per meter for roads of less than 10 metre width (4 to 6 watts per metre for wider roads   such a measure provides an easily applicable environmental protection constraint on conventional  norms   which usually are based on the recommendations of lighting manufacturing interests  who may not take into account environmental criteria  in view of ongoing progress in lighting technology  target sec values will need to be periodically revised downwards   a newer method for predicting and measuring various aspects of light pollution was described in the journal lighting research technology  september 2008   scientists at rensselaer polytechnic institute s lighting research center have developed a comprehensive method called outdoor site-lighting performance  osp   which allows users to quantify  and thus optimize  the performance of existing and planned lighting designs and applications to minimize excessive or obtrusive light leaving the boundaries of a property  osp can be used by lighting engineers immediately  particularly for the investigation of glow and trespass  glare analyses are more complex to perform and current commercial software does not readily allow them   and can help users compare several lighting design alternatives for the same site  92   in the effort to reduce light pollution  researchers have developed a  unified system of photometry   which is a way to measure how much or what kind of street lighting is needed  the unified system of photometry allows light fixtures to be designed to reduce energy use while maintaining or improving perceptions of visibility  safety  and security  93  there was a need to create a new system of light measurement at night because the biological way in which the eye u2019s rods and cones process light is different in nighttime conditions versus daytime conditions  using this new system of photometry  results from recent studies have indicated that replacing traditional  yellowish  high-pressure sodium  hps  lights with  cool  white light sources  such as induction  fluorescent  ceramic metal halide  or leds can actually reduce the amount of electric power used for lighting while maintaining or improving visibility in nighttime conditions  94   the international commission on illumination  also known as the cie from its french title  la commission internationale de l eclairage  will soon be releasing its own form of unified photometry for outdoor lighting
