Biodiversity
 biodiversity  a contraction of  biological diversity   generally refers to the variety and variability of life on earth  one of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species  between species and between ecosystems  1  it is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems  this can refer to genetic variation  ecosystem variation  or species variation  number of species  1  within an area  biome  or planet  terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator  2  which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity  3  biodiversity is not distributed evenly on earth  it is richest in the tropics  marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the western pacific  where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans  there are latitudinal gradients in species diversity  4  biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots  5  and has been increasing through time  6][7  but will be likely to slow in the future  8   the number and variety of plants  animals and other organisms that exist is known as biodiversity  it is an essential component of nature and it ensures the survival of human species by providing food  fuel  shelter  medicines and other resources to mankind  the richness of biodiversity depends on the climatic conditions and area of the region  all species of plants taken together are known as flora and about 300,000 species of plants are known to date  all species of animals taken together are known as fauna which includes birds  mammals  fish  reptiles  insects  crustaceans  molluscs  etc   rapid environmental changes typically cause mass extinctions  9][10][11  more than 99 percent of all species  amounting to over five billion species  12  that ever lived on earth are estimated to be extinct  13][14  estimates on the number of earth s current species range from 10 million to 14 million  15  of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described  16  more recently  in may 2016  scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described  17  the total amount of related dna base pairs on earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes  18  in comparison  the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 ttc  trillion tons of carbon   19  in july 2016  scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the last universal common ancestor  luca  of all organisms living on earth  20   the age of the earth is about 4.54 billion years old  21][22][23  the earliest undisputed evidence of life on earth dates at least from 3.5 billion years ago  24][25][26  during the eoarchean era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten hadean eon  there are microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in western australia  27][28][29  other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in 3.7 billion-year-old meta-sedimentary rocks discovered in western greenland  30  more recently  in 2015   remains of biotic life  were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia  31][32  according to one of the researchers   if life arose relatively quickly on earth    then it could be common in the universe   31   since life began on earth  five major mass extinctions and several minor events have led to large and sudden drops in biodiversity  the phanerozoic eon  the last 540\xa0million years  marked a rapid growth in biodiversity via the cambrian explosion u2014a period during which the majority of multicellular phyla first appeared  33  the next 400\xa0million years included repeated  massive biodiversity losses classified as mass extinction events  in the carboniferous  rainforest collapse led to a great loss of plant and animal life  34  the permian u2013triassic extinction event  251\xa0million years ago  was the worst  vertebrate recovery took 30\xa0million years  35  the most recent  the cretaceous u2013paleogene extinction event  occurred 65\xa0million years ago and has often attracted more attention than others because it resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs  36   the period since the emergence of humans has displayed an ongoing biodiversity reduction and an accompanying loss of genetic diversity  named the holocene extinction  the reduction is caused primarily by human impacts  particularly habitat destruction  37  conversely  biodiversity impacts human health in a number of ways  both positively and negatively  38   the united nations designated 2011\u20132020 as the united nations decade on biodiversity       the term biological diversity was used first by wildlife scientist and conservationist raymond f  dasmann in the year 1968 lay book a different kind of country 39  advocating conservation  the term was widely adopted only after more than a decade  when in the 1980s it came into common usage in science and environmental policy  thomas lovejoy  in the foreword to the book conservation biology  40  introduced the term to the scientific community  until then the term  natural diversity  was common  introduced by the science division of the nature conservancy in an important 1975 study   the preservation of natural diversity   by the early 1980s tnc s science program and its head  robert e  jenkins  41  lovejoy and other leading conservation scientists at the time in america advocated the use of the term  biological diversity    the term s contracted form biodiversity may have been coined by w g  rosen in 1985 while planning the 1986 national forum on biological diversity organized by the national research council  nrc   it first appeared in a publication in 1988 when sociobiologist e  o  wilson used it as the title of the proceedings 42  of that forum  43   since this period the term has achieved widespread use among biologists  environmentalists  political leaders and concerned citizens   a similar term in the united states is  natural heritage   it pre-dates the others and is more accepted by the wider audience interested in conservation  broader than biodiversity  it includes geology and landforms  citation needed  44    biodiversity  is most commonly used to replace the more clearly defined and long established terms  species diversity and species richness  biologists most often define biodiversity as the  totality of genes  species and ecosystems of a region   45][46  an advantage of this definition is that it seems to describe most circumstances and presents a unified view of the traditional types of biological variety previously identified   in 2003  anthony campbell defined a fourth level  molecular diversity  48   this multilevel construct is consistent with datman and lovejoy  an explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by bruce a  wilcox commissioned by the international union for the conservation of nature and natural resources  iucn  for the 1982 world national parks conference  wilcox s definition was  biological diversity is the variety of life forms   at all levels of biological systems  i e   molecular  organismic  population  species and ecosystem       49  the 1992 united nations earth summit defined  biological diversity  as  the variability among living organisms from all sources  including   inter alia   terrestrial  marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part  this includes diversity within species  between species and of ecosystems   50  this definition is used in the united nations convention on biological diversity  50   one textbook s definition is  variation of life at all levels of biological organization   51   genetically biodiversity can be defined as the diversity of alleles  genes and organisms  they study processes such as mutation and gene transfer that drive evolution  49   measuring diversity at one level in a group of organisms may not precisely correspond to diversity at other levels  however  tetrapod  terrestrial vertebrates  taxonomic and ecological diversity shows a very close correlation  52   biodiversity is not evenly distributed  rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions  among other factors  the diversity of all living things  biota  depends on temperature  precipitation  altitude  soils  geography and the presence of other species  the study of the spatial distribution of organisms  species and ecosystems  is the science of biogeography   diversity consistently measures higher in the tropics and in other localized regions such as the cape floristic region and lower in polar regions generally  rain forests that have had wet climates for a long time  such as yasun xed national park in ecuador  have particularly high biodiversity  53][54   terrestrial biodiversity is thought to be up to 25 times greater than ocean biodiversity  55  a recently discovered method put the total number of species on earth at 8.7 million  of which 2.1 million were estimated to live in the ocean  56  however  this estimate seems to under-represent the diversity of microorganisms   generally  there is an increase in biodiversity from the poles to the tropics  thus localities at lower latitudes have more species than localities at higher latitudes  this is often referred to as the latitudinal gradient in species diversity  several ecological mechanisms may contribute to the gradient  but the ultimate factor behind many of them is the greater mean temperature at the equator compared to that of the poles  57][58][59   even though terrestrial biodiversity declines from the equator to the poles  60  some studies claim that this characteristic is unverified in aquatic ecosystems  especially in marine ecosystems  61  the latitudinal distribution of parasites does not appear to follow this rule  62   a biodiversity hotspot is a region with a high level of endemic species that has experienced great habitat loss  63  the term hotspot was introduced in 1988 by norman myers  64][65][66][67  while hotspots are spread all over the world  the majority are forest areas and most are located in the tropics   brazil s atlantic forest is considered one such hotspot  containing roughly 20,000 plant species  1,350 vertebrates and millions of insects  about half of which occur nowhere else  citation needed  the island of madagascar and india are also particularly notable  colombia is characterized by high biodiversity  with the highest rate of species by area unit worldwide and it has the largest number of endemics  species that are not found naturally anywhere else  of any country  about 10  of the species of the earth can be found in colombia  including over 1,900 species of bird  more than in europe and north america combined  colombia has 10  of the world s mammals species  14  of the amphibian species and 18  of the bird species of the world  68  madagascar dry deciduous forests and lowland rainforests possess a high ratio of endemism  citation needed  since the island separated from mainland africa 66 million years ago  many species and ecosystems have evolved independently  citation needed  indonesia s 17,000 islands cover 735,355 square miles (1,904,560\xa0km2  and contain 10  of the world s flowering plants  12  of mammals and 17  of reptiles  amphibians and birds u2014along with nearly 240 million people  69  many regions of high biodiversity and or endemism arise from specialized habitats which require unusual adaptations  for example  alpine environments in high mountains  or northern european peat bogs  citation needed   accurately measuring differences in biodiversity can be difficult  selection bias amongst researchers may contribute to biased empirical research for modern estimates of biodiversity  in 1768  rev  gilbert white succinctly observed of his selborne  hampshire  all nature is so full  that that district produces the most variety which is the most examined   70   biodiversity is the result of 3.5 billion years of evolution  the origin of life has not been definitely established by science  however some evidence suggests that life may already have been well-established only a few hundred million years after the formation of the earth  until approximately 600 million years ago  all life consisted of archaea  bacteria  protozoans and similar single-celled organisms   the history of biodiversity during the phanerozoic  the last 540 million years   starts with rapid growth during the cambrian explosion u2014a period during which nearly every phylum of multicellular organisms first appeared  over the next 400 million years or so  invertebrate diversity showed little overall trend and vertebrate diversity shows an overall exponential trend  52  this dramatic rise in diversity was marked by periodic  massive losses of diversity classified as mass extinction events  52  a significant loss occurred when rainforests collapsed in the carboniferous  34  the worst was the permian-triassic extinction event  251 million years ago  vertebrates took 30 million years to recover from this event  35   the fossil record suggests that the last few million years featured the greatest biodiversity in history  52  however  not all scientists support this view  since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent geologic sections  some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts  modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago   72  whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life  52  estimates of the present global macroscopic species diversity vary from 2 million to 100 million  with a best estimate of somewhere near 9 million  56  the vast majority arthropods  73  diversity appears to increase continually in the absence of natural selection  74   the existence of a  global carrying capacity   limiting the amount of life that can live at once  is debated  as is the question of whether such a limit would also cap the number of species  while records of life in the sea shows a logistic pattern of growth  life on land  insects  plants and tetrapods shows an exponential rise in diversity  as one author states   tetrapods have not yet invaded 64 per cent of potentially habitable modes and it could be that without human influence the ecological and taxonomic diversity of tetrapods would continue to increase in an exponential fashion until most or all of the available ecospace is filled   52   it also appears that the diversity continue to increase over time  especially after mass extinctions  75   on the other hand  changes through the phanerozoic correlate much better with the hyperbolic model  widely used in population biology  demography and macrosociology  as well as fossil biodiversity  than with exponential and logistic models  the latter models imply that changes in diversity are guided by a first-order positive feedback  more ancestors  more descendants  and or a negative feedback arising from resource limitation  hyperbolic model implies a second-order positive feedback  the hyperbolic pattern of the world population growth arises from a second-order positive feedback between the population size and the rate of technological growth  76  the hyperbolic character of biodiversity growth can be similarly accounted for by a feedback between diversity and community structure complexity  the similarity between the curves of biodiversity and human population probably comes from the fact that both are derived from the interference of the hyperbolic trend with cyclical and stochastic dynamics  76][77   most biologists agree however that the period since human emergence is part of a new mass extinction  named the holocene extinction event  caused primarily by the impact humans are having on the environment  78  it has been argued that the present rate of extinction is sufficient to eliminate most species on the planet earth within 100 years  79   new species are regularly discovered  on average between 5\u201310,000 new species each year  most of them insects  and many  though discovered  are not yet classified  estimates are that nearly 90  of all arthropods are not yet classified   73  most of the terrestrial diversity is found in tropical forests and in general  land has more species than the ocean  some 8.7 million species may exists on earth  of which some 2.1 million live in the ocean  56    ecosystem services are the suite of benefits that ecosystems provide to humanity   80   these services come in three flavors   there have been many claims about biodiversity s effect on these ecosystem services  especially provisioning and regulating services  after an exhaustive survey through peer-reviewed literature to evaluate 36 different claims about biodiversity s effect on ecosystem services  14 of those claims have been validated  6 demonstrate mixed support or are unsupported  3 are incorrect and 13 lack enough evidence to draw definitive conclusions  80   other sources have reported somewhat conflicting results and in 1997 robert costanza and colleagues reported the estimated global value of ecosystem services  not captured in traditional markets  at an average of $33 trillion annually  97   since the stone age  species loss has accelerated above the average basal rate  driven by human activity  estimates of species losses are at a rate 100-10,000 times as fast as is typical in the fossil record  98  biodiversity also affords many non-material benefits including spiritual and aesthetic values  knowledge systems and education  98   agricultural diversity can be divided into two categories  intraspecific diversity  which includes the genetic variety within a single species  like the potato  solanum tuberosum  that is composed of many different forms and types  e g   in the u s  we might compare russet potatoes with new potatoes or purple potatoes  all different  but all part of the same species  s  tuberosum    the other category of agricultural diversity is called interspecific diversity and refers to the number and types of different species  thinking about this diversity we might note that many small vegetable farmers grow many different crops like potatoes and also carrots  peppers  lettuce etc   agricultural diversity can also be divided by whether it is \u2018planned u2019 diversity or \u2018associated u2019 diversity  this is a functional classification that we impose and not an intrinsic feature of life or diversity  planned diversity includes the crops which a farmer has encouraged  planted or raised  e g   crops  covers  symbionts and livestock  among others   which can be contrasted with the associated diversity that arrives among the crops  uninvited  e g   herbivores  weed species and pathogens  among others   99   the control of associated biodiversity is one of the great agricultural challenges that farmers face  on monoculture farms  the approach is generally to eradicate associated diversity using a suite of biologically destructive pesticides  mechanized tools and transgenic engineering techniques  then to rotate crops  although some polyculture farmers use the same techniques  they also employ integrated pest management strategies as well as strategies that are more labor-intensive  but generally less dependent on capital  biotechnology and energy   interspecific crop diversity is  in part  responsible for offering variety in what we eat  intraspecific diversity  the variety of alleles within a single species  also offers us choice in our diets  if a crop fails in a monoculture  we rely on agricultural diversity to replant the land with something new  if a wheat crop is destroyed by a pest we may plant a hardier variety of wheat the next year  relying on intraspecific diversity  we may forgo wheat production in that area and plant a different species altogether  relying on interspecific diversity  even an agricultural society which primarily grows monocultures  relies on biodiversity at some point   monoculture was a contributing factor to several agricultural disasters  including the european wine industry collapse in the late 19th century and the us southern corn leaf blight epidemic of 1970.[102   although about 80 percent of humans  food supply comes from just 20 kinds of plants  citation needed  humans use at least 40,000 species  citation needed  many people depend on these species for food  shelter and clothing  citation needed  earth s surviving biodiversity provides resources for increasing the range of food and other products suitable for human use  although the present extinction rate shrinks that potential  79   biodiversity s relevance to human health is becoming an international political issue  as scientific evidence builds on the global health implications of biodiversity loss  103][104  [105  this issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change  106  as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity  e g  changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors  scarcity of fresh water  impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc   this is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission  while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission  such as that of west nile virus  lyme disease and hantavirus  according to a study done co-authored by felicia keesing  an ecologist at bard college and drew harvell  associate director for environment of the atkinson center for a sustainable future  acsf  at cornell university  107   the growing demand and lack of drinkable water on the planet presents an additional challenge to the future of human health  partly  the problem lies in the success of water suppliers to increase supplies and failure of groups promoting preservation of water resources  108  while the distribution of clean water increases  in some parts of the world it remains unequal  according to 2008 world population data sheet  only 62  of least developed countries are able to access clean water  109   some of the health issues influenced by biodiversity include dietary health and nutrition security  infectious disease  medical science and medicinal resources  social and psychological health  110  biodiversity is also known to have an important role in reducing disaster risk and in post-disaster relief and recovery efforts  111][112   biodiversity provides critical support for drug discovery and the availability of medicinal resources  113][114  a significant proportion of drugs are derived  directly or indirectly  from biological sources  at least 50  of the pharmaceutical compounds on the us market are derived from plants  animals and micro-organisms  while about 80  of the world population depends on medicines from nature  used in either modern or traditional medical practice  for primary healthcare  104  only a tiny fraction of wild species has been investigated for medical potential  biodiversity has been critical to advances throughout the field of bionics  evidence from market analysis and biodiversity science indicates that the decline in output from the pharmaceutical sector since the mid-1980s can be attributed to a move away from natural product exploration   bioprospecting   in favor of genomics and synthetic chemistry  indeed claims about the value of undiscovered pharmaceuticals may not provide enough incentive for companies in free markets to search for them because of the high cost of development  115  meanwhile  natural products have a long history of supporting significant economic and health innovation  116][117  marine ecosystems are particularly important  118  although inappropriate bioprospecting can increase biodiversity loss  as well as violating the laws of the communities and states from which the resources are taken  119][120][121   many industrial materials derive directly from biological sources  these include building materials  fibers  dyes  rubber and oil  biodiversity is also important to the security of resources such as water  timber  paper  fiber and food  122][123][124  as a result  biodiversity loss is a significant risk factor in business development and a threat to long term economic sustainability  125][126   biodiversity enriches leisure activities such as hiking  birdwatching or natural history study  biodiversity inspires musicians  painters  sculptors  writers and other artists  many cultures view themselves as an integral part of the natural world which requires them to respect other living organisms   popular activities such as gardening  fishkeeping and specimen collecting strongly depend on biodiversity  the number of species involved in such pursuits is in the tens of thousands  though the majority do not enter commerce   the relationships between the original natural areas of these often exotic animals and plants and commercial collectors  suppliers  breeders  propagators and those who promote their understanding and enjoyment are complex and poorly understood  the general public responds well to exposure to rare and unusual organisms  reflecting their inherent value   philosophically it could be argued that biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and spiritual value to mankind in and of itself  this idea can be used as a counterweight to the notion that tropical forests and other ecological realms are only worthy of conservation because of the services they provide  127   biodiversity supports many ecosystem services    there is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources  produce biomass  decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients    there is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time    diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture    the impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change    maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time   80   it plays a part in regulating the chemistry of our atmosphere and water supply  biodiversity is directly involved in water purification  recycling nutrients and providing fertile soils  experiments with controlled environments have shown that humans cannot easily build ecosystems to support human needs  128  for example insect pollination cannot be mimicked  citation needed  and that activity alone represented between $2.1-14.6 billions in 2003.[129   according to mora and colleagues  the total number of terrestrial species is estimated to be around 8.7 million while the number of oceanic species is much lower  estimated at 2.2 million  the authors note that these estimates are strongest for eukaryotic organisms and likely represent the lower bound of prokaryote diversity  130  other estimates include   since the rate of extinction has increased  many extant species may become extinct before they are described  142  not surprisingly  in the animalia the most studied groups are birds and mammals  whereas fishes and arthropods are the least studied animals groups  143   no longer do we have to justify the existence of humid tropical forests on the feeble grounds that they might carry plants with drugs that cure human disease  gaia theory forces us to see that they offer much more than this  through their capacity to evapotranspirate vast volumes of water vapor  they serve to keep the planet cool by wearing a sunshade of white reflecting cloud  their replacement by cropland could precipitate a disaster that is global in scale   during the last century  decreases in biodiversity have been increasingly observed  in 2007  german federal environment minister sigmar gabriel cited estimates that up to 30  of all species will be extinct by 2050.[144  of these  about one eighth of known plant species are threatened with extinction  145  estimates reach as high as 140,000 species per year  based on species-area theory   146  this figure indicates unsustainable ecological practices  because few species emerge each year  citation needed  almost all scientists acknowledge that the rate of species loss is greater now than at any time in human history  with extinctions occurring at rates hundreds of times higher than background extinction rates  145  as of 2012  some studies suggest that 25  of all mammal species could be extinct in 20 years  147   in absolute terms  the planet has lost 52  of its biodiversity since 1970 according to a 2014 study by the world wildlife fund  the living planet report 2014 claims that  the number of mammals  birds  reptiles  amphibians and fish across the globe is  on average  about half the size it was 40 years ago   of that number  39  accounts for the terrestrial wildlife gone  39  for the marine wildlife gone and 76  for the freshwater wildlife gone  biodiversity took the biggest hit in latin america  plummeting 83 percent  high-income countries showed a 10  increase in biodiversity  which was canceled out by a loss in low-income countries  this is despite the fact that high-income countries use five times the ecological resources of low-income countries  which was explained as a result of process whereby wealthy nations are outsourcing resource depletion to poorer nations  which are suffering the greatest ecosystem losses  148   in 2006 many species were formally classified as rare or endangered or threatened  moreover  scientists have estimated that millions more species are at risk which have not been formally recognized  about 40 percent of the 40,177 species assessed using the iucn red list criteria are now listed as threatened with extinction u2014a total of 16,119.[149   jared diamond describes an  evil quartet  of habitat destruction  overkill  introduced species and secondary extinctions  150  edward o  wilson prefers the acronym hippo  standing for habitat destruction  invasive species  pollution  human over-population and over-harvesting  151][152  the most authoritative classification in use today is iucn s classification of direct threats 153  which has been adopted by major international conservation organizations such as the us nature conservancy  the world wildlife fund  conservation international and birdlife international   habitat destruction has played a key role in extinctions  especially related to tropical forest destruction  154  factors contributing to habitat loss are  overconsumption  overpopulation  land use change  deforestation  155  pollution  air pollution  water pollution  soil contamination  and global warming or climate change  citation needed   habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related  physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area  156  conversion to  trivial  standardized ecosystems  e g   monoculture following deforestation  effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion  in some countries lack of property rights or lax law regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss  degradation costs having to be supported by the community   citation needed   a 2007 study conducted by the national science foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent u2014that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa   if any one type is removed from the system  the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species   157  at present  the most threatened ecosystems are found in fresh water  according to the millennium ecosystem assessment 2005  which was confirmed by the  freshwater animal diversity assessment   organised by the biodiversity platform and the french institut de recherche pour le d xe9veloppement (mnhnp   158   co-extinctions are a form of habitat destruction  co-extinction occurs when the extinction or decline in one accompanies the other  such as in plants and beetles  159   barriers such as large rivers  seas  oceans  mountains and deserts encourage diversity by enabling independent evolution on either side of the barrier  via the process of allopatric speciation  the term invasive species is applied to species that breach the natural barriers that would normally keep them constrained  without barriers  such species occupy new territory  often supplanting native species by occupying their niches  or by using resources that would normally sustain native species   the number of species invasions has been on the rise at least since the beginning of the 1900s  species are increasingly being moved by humans  on purpose and accidentally   in some cases the invaders are causing drastic changes and damage to their new habitats  e g   zebra mussels and the emerald ash borer in the great lakes region and the lion fish along the north american atlantic coast   some evidence suggests that invasive species are competitive in their new habitats because they are subject to less pathogen disturbance  160  others report confounding evidence that occasionally suggest that species-rich communities harbor many native and exotic species simultaneously 161  while some say that diverse ecosystems are more resilient and resist invasive plants and animals  162  an important question is   do invasive species cause extinctions   many studies cite effects of invasive species on natives  163  but not extinctions  invasive species seem to increase local  i e   alpha diversity  diversity  which decreases turnover of diversity  i e   beta diversity   overall gamma diversity may be lowered because species are going extinct because of other causes  164  but even some of the most insidious invaders  e g   dutch elm disease  emerald ash borer  chestnut blight in north america  have not caused their host species to become extinct  extirpation  population decline and homogenization of regional biodiversity are much more common  human activities have frequently been the cause of invasive species circumventing their barriers  165  by introducing them for food and other purposes  human activities therefore allow species to migrate to new areas  and thus become invasive  occurred on time scales much shorter than historically have been required for a species to extend its range   not all introduced species are invasive  nor all invasive species deliberately introduced  in cases such as the zebra mussel  invasion of us waterways was unintentional  in other cases  such as mongooses in hawaii  the introduction is deliberate but ineffective  nocturnal rats were not vulnerable to the diurnal mongoose   in other cases  such as oil palms in indonesia and malaysia  the introduction produces substantial economic benefits  but the benefits are accompanied by costly unintended consequences   finally  an introduced species may unintentionally injure a species that depends on the species it replaces  in belgium  prunus spinosa from eastern europe leafs much sooner than its west european counterparts  disrupting the feeding habits of the thecla betulae butterfly  which feeds on the leaves   introducing new species often leaves endemic and other local species unable to compete with the exotic species and unable to survive  the exotic organisms may be predators  parasites  or may simply outcompete indigenous species for nutrients  water and light   at present  several countries have already imported so many exotic species  particularly agricultural and ornamental plants  that their own indigenous fauna flora may be outnumbered  for example  the introduction of kudzu from southeast asia to canada and the united states has threatened biodiversity in certain areas  166   endemic species can be threatened with extinction 167  through the process of genetic pollution  i e  uncontrolled hybridization  introgression and genetic swamping  genetic pollution leads to homogenization or replacement of local genomes as a result of either a numerical and or fitness advantage of an introduced species  168  hybridization and introgression are side-effects of introduction and invasion  these phenomena can be especially detrimental to rare species that come into contact with more abundant ones  the abundant species can interbreed with the rare species  swamping its gene pool  this problem is not always apparent from morphological  outward appearance  observations alone  some degree of gene flow is normal adaptation and not all gene and genotype constellations can be preserved  however  hybridization with or without introgression may  nevertheless  threaten a rare species  existence  169][170   overexploitation occurs when a resource is consumed at an unsustainable rate  this occurs on land in the form of overhunting  excessive logging  poor soil conservation in agriculture and the illegal wildlife trade   about 25  of world fisheries are now overfished to the point where their current biomass is less than the level that maximizes their sustainable yield  171   the overkill hypothesis  a pattern of large animal extinctions connected with human migration patterns  can be used explain why megafaunal extinctions can occur within a relatively short time period  172   in agriculture and animal husbandry  the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to increase yield  often hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases  local governments and industry have been pushing hybridization  formerly huge gene pools of various wild and indigenous breeds have collapsed causing widespread genetic erosion and genetic pollution  this has resulted in loss of genetic diversity and biodiversity as a whole  173   genetically modified organisms contain genetic material that is altered through genetic engineering  genetically modified crops have become a common source for genetic pollution in not only wild varieties  but also in domesticated varieties derived from classical hybridization  174][175][176][177][178   genetic erosion and genetic pollution have the potential to destroy unique genotypes  threatening future access to food security  a decrease in genetic diversity weakens the ability of crops and livestock to be hybridized to resist disease and survive changes in climate  173   global warming is also considered to be a major potential threat to global biodiversity in the future  179][180  for example  coral reefs - which are biodiversity hotspots - will be lost within the century if global warming continues at the current trend  181][182   climate change has seen many claims about potential to affect biodiversity but evidence supporting the statement is tenuous  increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide certainly affects plant morphology 183  and is acidifying oceans  184  and temperature affects species ranges  185][186][187  phenology  188  and weather  189  but the major impacts that have been predicted are still just potential impacts  we have not documented major extinctions yet  even as climate change drastically alters the biology of many species   in 2004  an international collaborative study on four continents estimated that 10 percent of species would become extinct by 2050 because of global warming   we need to limit climate change or we wind up with a lot of species in trouble  possibly extinct   said dr  lee hannah  a co-author of the paper and chief climate change biologist at the center for applied biodiversity science at conservation international  190   a recent study predicts that up to 35  of the world terrestrial carnivores and ungulates will be at higher risk of extinction by 2050 because of the joint effects of predicted climate and land-use change under business-as-usual human development scenarios  191   from 1950 to 2011  world population increased from 2.5 billion to 7 billion and is forecast to reach a plateau of more than 9 billion during the 21st century  192  some recent forecasts place the possible number of people on the planet at 11 billion or 15 billion by 2100.[193][194][195][196  sir david king  former chief scientific adviser to the uk government  told a parliamentary inquiry   it is self-evident that the massive growth in the human population through the 20th century has had more impact on biodiversity than any other single factor   197][198  at least until the middle of the 21st century  worldwide losses of pristine biodiverse land will probably depend much on the worldwide human birth rate  199  biologists such as paul r  ehrlich and stuart pimm have noted that human population growth is one of the main drivers of species extinction  200][201   according to a 2014 study by the world wildlife fund  the global human population already exceeds planet s biocapacity - it would take the equivalent of 1.5 earths of biocapacity to meet our current demands  202  the report further points that if everyone on the planet had the footprint of the average resident of qatar  we would need 4.8 earths and if we lived the lifestyle of a typical resident of the usa  we would need 3.9 earths  148   rates of decline in biodiversity in this sixth mass extinction match or exceed rates of loss in the five previous mass extinction events in the fossil record  203][204][205][206][207][208][209  loss of biodiversity results in the loss of natural capital that supplies ecosystem goods and services  from the perspective of the method known as natural economy the economic value of 17 ecosystem services for earth s biosphere  calculated in 1997  has an estimated value of us 33 trillion (3.3x1013  per year  210   conservation biology matured in the mid-20th century as ecologists  naturalists and other scientists began to research and address issues pertaining to global biodiversity declines  212][213][214   the conservation ethic advocates management of natural resources for the purpose of sustaining biodiversity in species  ecosystems  the evolutionary process and human culture and society  204][212][214][215][216   conservation biology is reforming around strategic plans to protect biodiversity  212][217][218  preserving global biodiversity is a priority in strategic conservation plans that are designed to engage public policy and concerns affecting local  regional and global scales of communities  ecosystems and cultures  219  action plans identify ways of sustaining human well-being  employing natural capital  market capital and ecosystem services  220][221   in the eu directive 1999/22 ec zoos are described as having a role in the preservation of the biodiversity of wildlife animals by conducting research or participation in breeding programs  222   removal of exotic species will allow the species that they have negatively impacted to recover their ecological niches  exotic species that have become pests can be identified taxonomically (e g   xa0with digital automated identification system  daisy   using the barcode of life   223][224  removal is practical only given large groups of individuals due to the economic cost   as sustainable populations of the remaining native species in an area become assured   missing  species that are candidates for reintroduction can be identified using databases such as the encyclopedia of life and the global biodiversity information facility   protected areas is meant for affording protection to wild animals and their habitat which also includes forest reserves and biosphere reserves  protected areas have been set up all over the world with the specific aim of protecting and conserving plants and animals   national park and nature reserve is the area selected by governments or private organizations for special protection against damage or degradation with the objective of biodiversity and landscape conservation  national parks are usually owned and managed by national or state governments  a limit is placed on the number of visitors permitted to enter certain fragile areas  designated trails or roads are created  the visitors are allowed to enter only for study  cultural and recreation purposes  forestry operations  grazing of animals and hunting of animals are regulated  exploitation of habitat or wildlife is banned   wildlife sanctuary aims only at conservation of species and have the following features   the forests play a vital role in harbouring more than 45,000 floral and 81,000 faunal species of which 5150 floral and 1837 faunal species are endemic  plant and animal species confined to a specific geographical area are called endemic species  in reserved forests  rights to activities like hunting and grazing are sometimes given to communities living on the fringes of the forest  who sustain their livelihood partially or wholly from forest resources or products  the unclassed forests covers 6.4 percent of the total forest area and they are marked by the following characteristics   in zoological parks or zoos  live animals are kept for public recreation  education and conservation purposes  modern zoos offer veterinary facilities  provide opportunities for threatened species to breed in captivity and usually build environments that simulate the native habitats of the animals in their care  zoos play a major role in creating awareness among common people about the need to conserve nature   botanical garden is a garden in which plants are grown and displayed primarily for scientific and educational purposes  it consists of a collection of living plants  grown outdoors or under glass in greenhouses and conservatories  in addition  it includes a collection of dried plants or herbarium and such facilities as lecture rooms  laboratories  libraries  museums and experimental or research plantings   focusing on limited areas of higher potential biodiversity promises greater immediate return on investment than spreading resources evenly or focusing on areas of little diversity but greater interest in biodiversity  226   a second strategy focuses on areas that retain most of their original diversity  which typically require little or no restoration  these are typically non-urbanized  non-agricultural areas  tropical areas often fit both criteria  given their natively high diversity and relative lack of development  227   global agreements such as the convention on biological diversity  give  sovereign national rights over biological resources   not property   the agreements commit countries to  conserve biodiversity    develop resources for sustainability  and  share the benefits  resulting from their use  biodiverse countries that allow bioprospecting or collection of natural products  expect a share of the benefits rather than allowing the individual or institution that discovers exploits the resource to capture them privately  bioprospecting can become a type of biopiracy when such principles are not respected  citation needed   sovereignty principles can rely upon what is better known as access and benefit sharing agreements  abas   the convention on biodiversity implies informed consent between the source country and the collector  to establish which resource will be used and for what and to settle on a fair agreement on benefit sharing   biodiversity is taken into account in some political and judicial decisions   uniform approval for use of biodiversity as a legal standard has not been achieved  however  bosselman argues that biodiversity should not be used as a legal standard  claiming that the remaining areas of scientific uncertainty cause unacceptable administrative waste and increase litigation without promoting preservation goals  229   india passed the biological diversity act in 2002 for the conservation of biological diversity in india  the act also provides mechanisms for equitable sharing of benefits from the use of traditional biological resources and knowledge   less than 1  of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting their existence  230  the vast majority of earth s species are microbial  contemporary biodiversity physics is  firmly fixated on the visible  macroscopic  world   231  for example  microbial life is metabolically and environmentally more diverse than multicellular life  see e g   extremophile    on the tree of life  based on analyses of small-subunit ribosomal rna  visible life consists of barely noticeable twigs  the inverse relationship of size and population recurs higher on the evolutionary ladder u2014 to a first approximation  all multicellular species on earth are insects   232  insect extinction rates are high u2014supporting the holocene extinction hypothesis  [233][234
