Celsius
 celsius  also known as centigrade  1][2  is a metric 3  scale and unit of measurement for temperature  as an si derived unit  it is used by most countries in the world  it is named after the swedish astronomer anders celsius (1701\u20131744   who developed a similar temperature scale  the degree celsius (\xb0c  can refer to a specific temperature on the celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval  a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty  before being renamed to honour anders celsius in 1948  the unit was called centigrade  from the latin centum  which means 100  and gradus  which means steps   the scale is based on 0\xb0 for the freezing point of water and 100\xb0 for the boiling point of water at 1 atm pressure  this scale is widely taught in schools today  by international agreement the unit  degree celsius  and the celsius scale are currently defined by two different temperatures  absolute zero  and the triple point of vsmow  specially purified water   this definition also precisely relates the celsius scale to the kelvin scale  which defines the si base unit of thermodynamic temperature with symbol k  absolute zero  the lowest temperature possible  is defined as being precisely 0\xa0k and \u2212273.15\xa0\xb0c  the temperature of the triple point of water is defined as precisely 273.16\xa0k (0.01\xa0\xb0c  32.02\xa0\xb0f  at 611.657 pascals (6.11657\xa0mbar  0.00603659\xa0atm  pressure  4   this definition fixes the magnitude of both the degree celsius and the kelvin as precisely 1 part in 273.16  approximately 0.00366  of the difference between absolute zero and the triple point of water  thus  it sets the magnitude of one degree celsius and that of one kelvin as exactly the same  additionally  it establishes the difference between the two scales  null points as being precisely 273.15 degrees (\u2212273.15 \xb0c   0 k and 0 \xb0c   273.15 k   5       in 1742  swedish astronomer anders celsius (1701\u20131744  created a temperature scale which was the reverse of the scale now known by the name  celsius   0 represented the boiling point of water  while 100 represented the freezing point of water  6  in his paper observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer  he recounted his experiments showing that the melting point of ice is essentially unaffected by pressure  he also determined with remarkable precision how the boiling point of water varied as a function of atmospheric pressure  he proposed that the zero point of his temperature scale  being the boiling point  would be calibrated at the mean barometric pressure at mean sea level  this pressure is known as one standard atmosphere  the bipm s 10th general conference on weights and measures  cgpm  later defined one standard atmosphere to equal precisely 1013250dynes per square centimetre (101.325\xa0kpa   7   in 1743  the lyonnais physicist jean-pierre christin  permanent secretary of the acad xe9mie des sciences  belles-lettres et arts de lyonfr  working independently of celsius  developed a scale where zero represented the freezing point of water and 100 represented the boiling point of water  8][9  on 19 may 1743 he published the design of a mercury thermometer  the  thermometer of lyon  built by the craftsman pierre casati that used this scale  10][11][12   in 1744  coincident with the death of anders celsius  the swedish botanist carolus linnaeus (1707\u20131778  reversed celsius s scale  13  his custom-made  linnaeus-thermometer   for use in his greenhouses  was made by daniel ekstr xf6m  sweden s leading maker of scientific instruments at the time and whose workshop was located in the basement of the stockholm observatory  as often happened in this age before modern communications  numerous physicists  scientists  and instrument makers are credited with having independently developed this same scale  14  among them were pehr elvius  the secretary of the royal swedish academy of sciences  which had an instrument workshop  and with whom linnaeus had been corresponding  daniel ekstr xf6m sv   the instrument maker  and m xe5rten str xf6mer (1707\u20131770  who had studied astronomy under anders celsius   the first known swedish document 15  reporting temperatures in this modern  forward  celsius scale is the paper hortus upsaliensis dated 16 december 1745 that linnaeus wrote to a student of his  samuel naucl xe9r  in it  linnaeus recounted the temperatures inside the orangery at the university of uppsala botanical garden      since the caldarium  the hot part of the greenhouse  by the angle of the windows  merely from the rays of the sun  obtains such heat that the thermometer often reaches 30 degrees  although the keen gardener usually takes care not to let it rise to more than 20 to 25 degrees  and in winter not under 15 degrees     since the 19th century  the scientific and thermometry communities worldwide referred to this scale as the centigrade scale  temperatures on the centigrade scale were often reported simply as degrees or  when greater specificity was desired  as degrees centigrade  symbol  \xb0c   because the term centigrade was also the spanish and french language name for a unit of angular measurement (1/100 of a right angle  and had a similar connotation in other languages  the term centesimal degree  known as the gradian   grad  or  gon   1\u1d4d   0.9\xb0  100\u1d4d   90\xb0  was used when very precise  unambiguous language was required by international standards bodies such as the bipm  more properly  what was defined as  centigrade  then would now be  hectograde   furthermore  in the context here  centigrade hectograde is referring to the whole 0-100 range  not the given part thereof  hence "20\xb0 centigrade  means "20\u1d4d per 100 gradians   or 20  hectograde   not its literal description  "0.2 gradians    to eliminate such confusion  the 9th cgpm and the cipm (comit xe9 international des poids et mesures  formally adopted  degree celsius  in 1948,[16  a  formally keeping the recognized degree symbol  rather than adopting the gradian centesimal degree symbol   for scientific use   celsius  is the term usually used  with  centigrade  otherwise continuing to be in common but decreasing use  especially in informal contexts in english-speaking countries  17  it was not until february 1985 that the forecasts issued by the bbc switched from  centigrade  to "celsius   18   some key temperatures relating the celsius scale to other temperature scales are shown in the table below   the  degree celsius  has been the only si unit whose full unit name contains an uppercase letter since the si base unit for temperature  the kelvin  became the proper name in 1967 replacing the term degrees kelvin  the plural form is degrees celsius  22   the general rule of the international bureau of weights and measures  bipm  is that the numerical value always precedes the unit  and a space is always used to separate the unit from the number  e g  "30.2 \xb0c   not "30.2\xb0c  or "30.2\xb0\xa0c    23  thus the value of the quantity is the product of the number and the unit  the space being regarded as a multiplication sign  just as a space between units implies multiplication   the only exceptions to this rule are for the unit symbols for degree  minute  and second for plane angle (\xb0  \u2032  and \u2033  respectively   for which no space is left between the numerical value and the unit symbol  24  other languages  and various publishing houses  may follow different typographical rules   unicode provides the celsius symbol at codepoint u 2103 \u2103 degree celsius  however  this is a compatibility character provided for roundtrip compatibility with legacy encodings  the unicode standard explicitly discourages the use of this character   in normal use  it is better to represent degrees celsius "\xb0c  with a sequence of u 00b0 \xb0 degree sign   u 0043 c latin capital letter c  rather than u 2103 \u2103 degree celsius  for searching  treat these two sequences as identical   25   shown below is the degree celsius character followed immediately by the two-component version   when viewed on computers that properly support unicode  the above line may be similar to the image in the line below  enlarged for clarity    the canonical decomposition is simply an ordinary degree sign and  c   so some browsers may simply display "\xb0c  in its place due to unicode normalization   the degree celsius is a special name for the kelvin for use in expressing celsius temperatures  26  the degree celsius is also subject to the same rules as the kelvin with regard to the use of its unit name and symbol  thus  besides expressing specific temperatures along its scale  e g   gallium melts at 29.7646\xa0\xb0c  and  the temperature outside is 23 degrees celsius    the degree celsius is also suitable for expressing temperature intervals  differences between temperatures or their uncertainties  e g   the output of the heat exchanger is hotter by 40 degrees celsius   and  our standard uncertainty is \xb13\xa0\xb0c    27  because of this dual usage  one must not rely upon the unit name or its symbol to denote that a quantity is a temperature interval  it must be unambiguous through context or explicit statement that the quantity is an interval  c  this is sometimes solved by using the symbol \xb0c  pronounced  degrees celsius   for a temperature  and c xb0  pronounced  celsius degrees   for a temperature interval  although this usage is non-standard  28   what is often confusing about the celsius measurement is that it follows an interval system but not a ratio system  that it follows a relative scale not an absolute scale  this is put simply by illustrating that while 10\xa0\xb0c and 20\xa0\xb0c have the same interval difference as 20\xa0\xb0c and 30\xa0\xb0c the temperature 20\xa0\xb0c is not twice the air heat energy as 10\xa0\xb0c  as this example shows  degrees celsius is a useful interval measurement but does not possess the characteristics of ratio measures like weight or distance  29   in science and in engineering  the celsius scale and the kelvin scale are often used in combination in close contexts  e g      a measured value was 0.01023\xa0\xb0c with an uncertainty of 70\xa0\xb5k      this practice is permissible because the magnitude of the degree celsius is equal to that of the kelvin   notwithstanding the official endorsement provided by decision #3 of resolution 3 of the 13th cgpm  which stated  a temperature interval may also be expressed in degrees celsius   the practice of simultaneously using both \xb0c and k remains widespread throughout the scientific world as the use of si-prefixed forms of the degree celsius  such as "\xb5\xb0c  or  microdegrees celsius   to express a temperature interval has not been well-adopted   one effect of defining the celsius scale at the triple point of vienna standard mean ocean water  vsmow  273.16\xa0k and 0.01\xa0\xb0c   and at absolute zero (0\xa0k and \u2212273.15\xa0\xb0c   is that neither the melting nor boiling point of water under one standard atmosphere (101.325\xa0kpa  remains a defining point for the celsius scale  in 1948 when the 9th general conference on weights and measures  cgpm  in resolution 3 first considered using the triple point of water as a defining point  the triple point was so close to being 0.01\xa0\xb0c greater than water s known melting point  it was simply defined as precisely 0.01\xa0\xb0c  30  however  current measurements show that the difference between the triple and melting points of vsmow is actually very slightly (&lt 0.001\xa0\xb0c  greater than 0.01\xa0\xb0c  thus  the actual melting point of ice is very slightly  less than a thousandth of a degree  below 0\xa0\xb0c  also  defining water s triple point at 273.16\xa0k precisely defined the magnitude of each 1\xa0\xb0c increment in terms of the absolute thermodynamic temperature scale  referencing absolute zero   now decoupled from the actual boiling point of water  the value "100\xa0\xb0c  is hotter than 0\xa0\xb0c \u2013 in absolute terms \u2013 by a factor of precisely 373.15/273.15  approximately 36.61  thermodynamically hotter   when adhering strictly to the two-point definition for calibration  the boiling point of vsmow under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339\xa0k (99.9839\xa0\xb0c   when calibrated to its-90  a calibration standard comprising many definition points and commonly used for high-precision instrumentation   the boiling point of vsmow is slightly less  about 99.974\xa0\xb0c  31   this boiling-point difference of 16.1 millikelvin between the celsius scale s original definition and the current one  based on absolute zero and the triple point  has little practical meaning in common daily applications because water s boiling point is very sensitive to variations in barometric pressure  for example  an altitude change of only 28\xa0cm (11\xa0in  causes the boiling point to change by one millikelvin
