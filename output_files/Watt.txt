Watt
 the watt  symbol  w  is a derived unit of power in the international system of units  si  defined as 1 joule per second 1  and can be used to quantify the rate of energy transfer  power has dimensions of \n n n n n n nm nl n n n n2\n n n n n nt n n n n u2212\n3 n n n n n   displaystyle    mathsf {ml    2    mathsf {t    -3   n n       when an object s velocity is held constant at one meter per second against constant opposing force of one newton the rate at which work is done is 1 watt   in terms of electromagnetism  one watt is the rate at which work is done when one ampere  a  of current flows through an electrical potential difference of one volt  v    two additional unit conversions for watt can be found using the above equation and ohm s law   where ohm (\n n n n u03a9 n n n   displaystyle   omega   n n  is the si derived unit of electrical resistance   the watt is named after the scottish scientist james watt for his contributions to the development of the steam engine  the measurement unit was recognized by the second congress of the british association for the advancement of science in 1882  concurrent with the start of commercial power production from both water and steam  in 1960 the 11th general conference on weights and measures adopted it for the measurement of power into the international system of units  si    the femtowatt is equal to one quadrillionth (10\u221215  of a watt  technologically important powers that are measured in femtowatts are typically found in reference s  to radio and radar receivers  for example  meaningful fm tuner performance figures for sensitivity  quieting and signal-to-noise require that the rf energy applied to the antenna input be specified  these input levels are often stated in dbf  decibels referenced to 1 femtowatt   this is 0.2739 microvolt across a 75-ohm load or 0.5477 microvolt across a 300-ohm load  the specification takes into account the rf input impedance of the tuner   the picowatt is equal to one trillionth (10\u221212  of a watt  technologically important powers that are measured in picowatts are typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers  acoustics and in the science of radio astronomy   the nanowatt is equal to one billionth (10\u22129  of a watt  important powers that are measured in nanowatts are also typically used in reference to radio and radar receivers   the microwatt is equal to one millionth (10\u22126  of a watt  important powers that are measured in microwatts are typically stated in medical instrumentation systems such as the eeg and the ecg  in a wide variety of scientific and engineering instruments and also in reference to radio and radar receivers  compact solar cells for devices such as calculators and watches are typically measured in microwatts  3   the milliwatt is equal to one thousandth (10\u22123  of a watt  a typical laser pointer outputs about five milliwatts of light power  whereas a typical hearing aid for people uses less than one milliwatt  4  audio signals and other electronic signal levels are often measured in dbm  referenced to one milliwatt   the kilowatt is equal to one thousand (103  watts  this unit is typically used to express the output power of engines and the power of electric motors  tools  machines  and heaters  it is also a common unit used to express the electromagnetic power output of broadcast radio and television transmitters   one kilowatt is approximately equal to 1.34 horsepower  a small electric heater with one heating element can use 1.0 kilowatt  the average electric power consumption of a household in the united states is about one kilowatt  notes 2][5   also  kilowatts of light power can be measured in the output pulses of some lasers   a surface area of one square meter on earth receives typically about one kilowatt of sunlight from the sun  the solar irradiance   on a clear day at mid day  close to the equator   6   the megawatt is equal to one million (106  watts  many events or machines produce or sustain the conversion of energy on this scale  including large electric motors  large warships such as aircraft carriers  cruisers  and submarines  large server farms or data centers  and some scientific research equipment  such as supercolliders  and the output pulses of very large lasers  a large residential or commercial building may use several megawatts in electric power and heat  on railways  modern high-powered electric locomotives typically have a peak power output of 5 or 6\xa0mw  although some produce much more  the eurostar  for example  uses more than 12\xa0mw  while heavy diesel-electric locomotives typically produce use 3 to 5\xa0mw  u s  nuclear power plants have net summer capacities between about 500 and 1300\xa0mw  7   the earliest citing of the megawatt in the oxford english dictionary  oed  is a reference in the 1900 webster s international dictionary of english language  the oed also states that megawatt appeared in a 28 november 1947 article in the journal science (506:2    the gigawatt is equal to one billion (109  watts or 1 gigawatt   1000 megawatts  this unit is often used for large power plants or power grids  for example  by the end of 2010 power shortages in china s shanxi province were expected to increase to 5\u20136 gw 8  and the installed capacity of wind power in germany was 25.8 gw  9  the largest unit  out of four  of the belgian doel nuclear power station has a peak output of 1.04 gw  10  hvdc converters have been built with power ratings of up to 2\xa0gw  11   the terawatt is equal to one trillion (1012  watts  the total power used by humans worldwide is commonly measured in terawatts  see primary energy   the most powerful lasers from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s produced power in terawatts  but only for nanosecond time frames  the average lightning strike peaks at 1 terawatt  but these strikes only last for 30 microseconds   the petawatt is equal to one quadrillion (1015  watts and can be produced by the current generation of lasers for time-scales on the order of picoseconds (10\u221212\xa0s   one such laser is the lawrence livermore s nova laser  which achieved a power output of 1.25\xa0pw (7015125000000000000\u26601.25\xd71015\xa0w  by a process called chirped pulse amplification  the duration of the pulse was roughly 0.5\xa0ps (6987500000000000000\u26605\xd710\u221213\xa0s   giving a total energy of 600\xa0j  or enough energy to power a 100\xa0w light bulb for six seconds  12  another example is the laser for fast ignition experiments  lfex  at the institute of laser engineering  ile   osaka university  which achieved a power output of 2\xa0pw (7015200000000000000\u26602\xd71015\xa0w  for a duration of approximately 1\xa0ps  13][14   based on the average total solar irradiance 15  of 1.366\xa0kw m2  the total power of sunlight striking earth s atmosphere is estimated at 174\xa0pw  see  solar constant    in the electric power industry  megawatt electrical (mwe 16  or mwe 17   refers by convention to the electric power produced by a generator  while megawatt thermal or thermal megawatt 18   mwt  mwt  or mwth  mwth  refers to thermal power produced by the plant  for example  the embalse nuclear power plant in argentina uses a fission reactor to generate 2109\xa0mwt  i e  heat   which creates steam to drive a turbine  which generates 648\xa0mwe  i e  electricity   other si prefixes are sometimes used  for example gigawatt electrical  gwe   the international bureau of weights and measures  which maintains the si-standard  states that further information about a quantity should not be attached to the unit symbol but instead to the quantity symbol  i e   pthermal xa0=\xa0270\xa0w rather than p xa0=\xa0270\xa0wth  and so these units are non-si  19  in compliance with si the energy company dong energy uses the unit megawatt for produced electrical power and the equivalent unit megajoule s for delivered heating power in a combined heat and power station such as aved xf8re power station  20   when describing alternating current  ac  electricity  another distinction is made between the watt and the volt-ampere  while these units are equivalent for simple resistive circuits  they differ when loads exhibit electrical reactance   radio stations usually report the power of their transmitters in units of watts  referring to the effective radiated power  it refers to the relative power of the transmission when it is directed towards the horizon for maximum geographic coverage  rather than uniformly broadcast in all directions   the terms power and energy are frequently confused  power is the rate at which energy is generated or consumed and hence is measured in units  e g  watts  that represent energy per unit time   for example  when a light bulb with a power rating of 100w is turned on for one hour  the energy used is 100\xa0watt hours (w xb7h   0.1\xa0kilowatt hour  or 360 kj  this same amount of energy would light a 40-watt bulb for 2.5\xa0hours  or a 50-watt bulb for 2\xa0hours  a power station would be rated in multiples of watts  for example  the three gorges dam is rated at approximately 22 gigawatts   but its annual energy sales or output would be in multiples of watt hours  major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt hours for a given period that is often a calendar year or financial year  one terawatt hour is equal to a sustained power of approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one year   the watt second is a unit of energy  equal to the joule  one kilowatt hour is 3 600 000 watt seconds  the watt second is used  for example  to rate the energy storage of flash lamps used in photography  although the term joule is generally employed   terms such as watts per hour  w h  are often misused when watts would be correct  21  watts per hour properly refers to a change of power per hour  watts per hour might be useful to characterize the ramp-up behavior of power plants  for example  a power plant that changes its power output from 0\xa0mw to 1\xa0mw in 15 minutes has a ramp-up rate of 4\xa0mw h  hydroelectric power plants have a very high ramp-up rate  which makes them particularly useful in peak load and emergency situations  the misnomer watts per hour is essentially the derivative of power and should be called rate of watt change per hour
