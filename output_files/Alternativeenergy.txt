Alternativeenergy
 alternative energy is any energy source that is an alternative to fossil fuel  these alternatives are intended to address concerns about such fossil fuels  such as its high carbon dioxide emissions  an important factor in global warming  marine energy  hydroelectric  wind  geothermal and solar power are all alternative sources of energy   the nature of what constitutes an alternative energy source has changed considerably over time  as have controversies regarding energy use  because of the variety of energy choices and differing goals of their advocates  defining some energy types as  alternative  is considered very controversial  1       historians of economies have examined the key transitions to alternative energies and regard the transitions as pivotal in bringing about significant economic change  8][9][10  prior to the shift to an alternative energy  supplies of the dominant energy type became erratic  accompanied by rapid increases in energy prices   in the late medieval period  coal was the new alternative fuel to save the society from overuse of the dominant fuel  wood  the deforestation had resulted in shortage of wood  at that time soft coal appeared as a savior  historian norman f  cantor describes how   whale oil was the dominant form of lubrication and fuel for lamps in the early 19th century  but the depletion of the whale stocks by mid century caused whale oil prices to skyrocket setting the stage for the adoption of petroleum which was first commercialized in pennsylvania in 1859.[12   in 1917  alexander graham bell advocated ethanol from corn  wheat and other foods as an alternative to coal and oil  stating that the world was in measurable distance of depleting these fuels  for bell  the problem requiring an alternative was lack of renewability of orthodox energy sources  13  since the 1970s  brazil has had an ethanol fuel program which has allowed the country to become the world s second largest producer of ethanol  after the united states  and the world s largest exporter  14  brazil u2019s ethanol fuel program uses modern equipment and cheap sugar cane as feedstock  and the residual cane-waste  bagasse  is used to process heat and power  15  there are no longer light vehicles in brazil running on pure gasoline  by the end of 2008 there were 35,000 filling stations throughout brazil with at least one ethanol pump  16   cellulosic ethanol can be produced from a diverse array of feedstocks  and involves the use of the whole crop  this new approach should increase yields and reduce the carbon footprint because the amount of energy-intensive fertilizers and fungicides will remain the same  for a higher output of usable material  17][18  as of 2008  there are nine commercial cellulosic ethanol plants which are either operating  or under construction  in the united states  19   second-generation biofuels technologies are able to manufacture biofuels from inedible biomass and could hence prevent conversion of food into fuel   20  as of july 2010  there is one commercial second-generation (2g  ethanol plant inbicon biomass refinery  which is operating in denmark  21   in the 1970s  president jimmy carter s administration advocated coal gasification as an alternative to expensive imported oil  the program  including the synthetic fuels corporation was scrapped when petroleum prices plummeted in the 1980s  the carbon footprint and environmental impact of coal gasification are both very high  citation needed   ice storage air conditioning and thermal storage heaters are methods of shifting consumption to use low cost off-peak electricity  when compared to resistance heating  heat pumps conserve electrical power  or in rare cases mechanical or thermal power  by collecting heat from a cool source such as a body of water  the ground or the air   thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from diurnal to interseasonal  and can involve storage of sensible energy  i e  by changing the temperature of a medium  or latent energy  e g  through phase changes of a medium  i e  changes from solid to liquid or vice versa   such as between water and slush or ice   energy sources can be natural  via solar-thermal collectors  or dry cooling towers used to collect winter s cold   waste energy  such as from hvac equipment  industrial processes or power plants   or surplus energy  such as seasonally from hydropower projects or intermittently from wind farms   the drake landing solar community  alberta  canada  is illustrative  borehole thermal energy storage allows the community to get 97  of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs  22][23  the storages can be insulated tanks  borehole clusters in substrates ranging from gravel to bedrock  deep aquifers  or shallow pits that are lined and insulated  some applications require inclusion of a heat pump   renewable energy is generated from natural resources u2014such as sunlight  24  wind  rain  tides and geothermal heat u2014which are renewable  naturally replenished   when comparing the processes for producing energy  there remain several fundamental differences between renewable energy and fossil fuels  the process of producing oil  coal  or natural gas fuel is a difficult and demanding process that requires a great deal of complex equipment  physical and chemical processes  on the other hand  alternative energy can be widely produced with basic equipment and natural processes  wood  the most renewable and available alternative fuel  emits the same amount of carbon when burned as would be emittted if it degraded naturally  25  nuclear power is an alternative to fossil fuels that is non-renewable  like fossil fuels  nuclear ones are a finite resource   a renewable energy source such as biomass is sometimes regarded as a good alternative to providing heat and electricity with fossil fuels  biofuels are not inherently ecologically friendly for this purpose  while burning biomass is carbon-neutral  air pollution is still produced  for example  the netherlands  once leader in use of palm oil as a biofuel  has suspended all subsidies for palm oil due to the scientific evidence that their use  may sometimes create more environmental harm than fossil fuels   26  the netherlands government and environmental groups are trying to trace the origins of imported palm oil  to certify which operations produce the oil in a responsible manner  26  regarding biofuels from foodstuffs  the realization that converting the entire grain harvest of the us would only produce 16  of its auto fuel needs  and the decimation of brazil s co2 absorbing tropical rain forests to make way for biofuel production has made it clear that placing energy markets in competition with food markets results in higher food prices and insignificant or negative impact on energy issues such as global warming or dependence on foreign energy  27  recently  alternatives to such undesirable sustainable fuels are being sought  such as commercially viable sources of cellulosic ethanol   carbon-neutral fuels are synthetic fuels  including methane  gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel or ammonia 28   produced by hydrogenating waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue-gas emissions  recovered from automotive exhaust gas  or derived from carbonic acid in seawater  29  commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce synthetic fuels for less than petroleum fuels when oil costs more than $55 per barrel  30  renewable methanol  rm  is a fuel produced from hydrogen and carbon dioxide by catalytic hydrogenation where the hydrogen has been obtained from water electrolysis  it can be blended into transportation fuel or processed as a chemical feedstock  31   the george olah carbon dioxide recycling plant operated by carbon recycling international in grindav xedk  iceland has been producing 2 million liters of methanol transportation fuel per year from flue exhaust of the svartsengi power station since 2011.[32  it has the capacity to produce 5 million liters per year  33  a 250 kilowatt methane synthesis plant was constructed by the center for solar energy and hydrogen research  zsw  at baden-w xfcrttemberg and the fraunhofer society in germany and began operating in 2010  it is being upgraded to 10 megawatts  scheduled for completion in autumn  2012.[34][35  audi has constructed a carbon-neutral liquefied natural gas  lng  plant in werlte  germany  36  the plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset lng used in their a3 sportback g-tron automobiles  and can keep 2,800 metric tons of co2 out of the environment per year at its initial capacity  37  other commercial developments are taking place in columbia  south carolina  38  camarillo  california  39  and darlington  england  40   such fuels are considered carbon-neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases  41  to the extent that synthetic fuels displace fossil fuels  or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid  42  and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe  they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere  and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation  43   such renewable fuels alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels  enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles  44  carbon-neutral fuels offer relatively low cost energy storage  alleviating the problems of wind and solar intermittency  and they enable distribution of wind  water  and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines  44   nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel  because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the day  but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day  so  the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative  44  germany has built a 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts  34][35][45   algae fuel is a biofuel which is derived from algae  during photosynthesis  algae and other photosynthetic organisms capture carbon dioxide and sunlight and convert it into oxygen and biomass  this is usually done by placing the algae between two panes of glass  the algae creates three forms of energy fuel  heat  from its growth cycle   biofuel  the natural  oil  derived from the algae   and biomass  from the algae itself  as it is harvested upon maturity   46   the heat can be used to power building systems  such as heat process water  or to produce energy  biofuel is oil extracted from the algae upon maturity  and used to create energy similar to the use of biodiesel  the biomass is the matter left over after extracting the oil and water  and can be harvested to produce combustible methane for energy production  similar to the warmth felt in a compost pile or the methane collected from biodegradable materials in a landfill  additionally  the benefits of algae biofuel are that it can be produced industrially  as well as vertically  i e  as a building facade   thereby obviating the use of arable land and food crops  such as soy  palm  and canola    biomass briquettes are being developed in the developing world as an alternative to charcoal  the technique involves the conversion of almost any plant matter into compressed briquettes that typically have about 70  the calorific value of charcoal  there are relatively few examples of large scale briquette production  one exception is in north kivu  in eastern democratic republic of congo  where forest clearance for charcoal production is considered to be the biggest threat to mountain gorilla habitat  the staff of virunga national park have successfully trained and equipped over 3500 people to produce biomass briquettes  thereby replacing charcoal produced illegally inside the national park  and creating significant employment for people living in extreme poverty in conflict affected areas  [47   biogas digestion deals with harnessing the methane gas that is released when waste breaks down  this gas can be retrieved from garbage or sewage systems  biogas digesters are used to process methane gas by having bacteria break down biomass in an anaerobic environment  [48  the methane gas that is collected and refined can be used as an energy source for various products   hydrogen gas is a completely clean burning fuel  its only by-product is water  49  it also contains relatively high amount of energy compared with other fuels due to its chemical structure  50   2h2   o2 \u2192 2h2o   high energy  high energy   2h2o \u2192 2h2   o2  this requires a high-energy input  making commercial hydrogen very inefficient  51  use of a biological vector as a means to split water  and therefore produce hydrogen gas  would allow for the only energy input to be solar radiation  biological vectors can include bacteria or more commonly algae  this process is known as biological hydrogen production  52  it requires the use of single celled organisms to create hydrogen gas through fermentation  without the presence of oxygen  also known as an anaerobic environment  regular cellular respiration cannot take place and a process known as fermentation takes over  a major by-product of this process is hydrogen gas  if this could be implemented on a large scale  then sunlight  nutrients and water could create hydrogen gas to be used as a dense source of energy  53  large-scale production has proven difficult  not until 1999  was it even possible to induce these anaerobic conditions by sulfur deprivation  54  since the fermentation process is an evolutionary back up  turned on during stress  the cells would die after a few days  in 2000  a two-stage process was developed to take the cells in and out of anaerobic conditions and therefore keep them alive  55  for the last ten years  finding a way to do this on a large-scale has been the main goal of research  careful work is being done to ensure an efficient process before large-scale production  however once a mechanism is developed  this type of production could solve our energy needs  56   hydroelectricity provided 75  of the worlds renewable electricity in 2013.[57  much of the electricity used today is a result of the heyday of conventional hydroelectric development between 1960 and 1980  which has virtually ceased in europe and north america due to environmental concerns  58  globally there is a trend towards more hydroelectricity  from 2004 to 2014 the installed capacity rose from 715 to 1,055 gw  59  a popular alternative to the large dams of the past is run-of-the-river where there is no water stored behind a dam and generation usually varies with seasonal rainfall  using run-of-the-river in wet seasons and solar in dry seasons can balance seasonal variations for both  another move away from large dams is small hydro  these tend to be situated high up on tributaries  rather than on main rivers in valley bottoms   offshore wind farms are similar to land-based wind farms  but are located on the ocean  offshore wind farms can be placed in water up to 40 metres (130\xa0ft  deep  whereas floating wind turbines can float in water up to 700 metres (2,300\xa0ft  deep  60  the advantage of having a floating wind farm is to be able to harness the winds from the open ocean  without any obstructions such as hills  trees and buildings  winds from the open ocean can reach up to speeds twice as fast as coastal areas  60][61   significant generation of offshore wind energy already contributes to electricity needs in europe and asia and now the first offshore wind farms are under development in u s  waters  while the offshore wind industry has grown dramatically over the last several decades  especially in europe  there is still uncertainty associated with how the construction and operation of these wind farms affect marine animals and the marine environment   traditional offshore wind turbines are attached to the seabed in shallower waters within the nearshore marine environment  as offshore wind technologies become more advanced  floating structures have begun to be used in deeper waters where more wind resources exist  62   marine and hydrokinetic  mhk  or marine energy development includes projects using the following devices   in the year 2015 ten new reactors came online and 67 more were under construction including the first eight new generation iii  ap1000 reactors in the us and china and the first four new generation iii epr reactors in finland  france and china  63  reactors are also under construction in belarus  brazil  india  iran  japan  pakistan  russia  slovakia  south korea  turkey  ukraine and united arab emirates   thorium is a fissionable material for possible future use in a thorium-based reactor  proponents of thorium reactors claims several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle  such as thorium s greater abundance  better resistance to nuclear weapons proliferation  64][65][66  and reduced plutonium and actinide production  66  thorium reactors can be modified to produce uranium-233  which can then be processed into highly enriched uranium  which has been tested in low yield weapons  67  and is unproven on a commercial scale  68][69   as an emerging economic sector  there are limited stock market investment opportunities in alternative energy available to the general public  the public can buy shares of alternative energy companies from various stock markets  with wildly volatile returns  the recent ipo of solarcity demonstrates the nascent nature of this sector- within a few weeks  it already had achieved the second highest market cap within the alternative energy sector  70   investors can also choose to invest in etfs  exchange-traded funds  that track an alternative energy index  such as the wilderhill new energy index  71  additionally  there are a number of mutual funds  such as calvert s global alternative energy mutual fund 72  that are a bit more proactive in choosing the selected investments   recently  mosaic inc  launched an online platform allowing residents of california and new york to invest directly in solar  73  investing in solar projects had previously been limited to accredited investors  74  or a small number of willing banks   over the last three years publicly traded alternative energy companies have been very volatile  with some 2007 returns in excess of 100   some 2008 returns down 90  or more  and peak-to-trough returns in 2009 again over 100   citation needed  in general there are three sub-segments of \u201calternative u201d energy investment  solar energy  wind energy and hybrid electric vehicles  alternative energy sources which are renewable and have lower carbon emissions than fossil fuels are hydropower  wind energy  solar energy  geothermal energy  and bio fuels  each of these four segments involve very different technologies and investment concerns   for example  photovoltaic solar energy is based on semiconductor processing and accordingly  benefits from steep cost reductions similar to those realized in the microprocessor industry  i e   driven by larger scale  higher module efficiency  and improving processing technologies   pv solar energy is perhaps the only energy technology whose electricity generation cost could be reduced by half or more over the next 5 years  better and more efficient manufacturing process and new technology such as advanced thin film solar cell is a good example of that helps to reduce industry cost  75   the economics of solar pv electricity are highly dependent on silicon pricing and even companies whose technologies are based on other materials  e g   first solar  are impacted by the balance of supply and demand in the silicon market  citation needed  in addition  because some companies sell completed solar cells on the open market  e g   q-cells   this creates a low barrier to entry for companies that want to manufacture solar modules  which in turn can create an irrational pricing environment   in contrast  because wind power has been harnessed for over 100 years  its underlying technology is relatively stable  its economics are largely determined by siting  e g   how hard the wind blows and the grid investment requirements  and the prices of steel  the largest component of a wind turbine  and select composites  used for the blades   because current wind turbines are often in excess of 100 meters high  logistics and a global manufacturing platform are major sources of competitive advantage  these issues and others were explored in a research report by sanford bernstein  76   due to steadily rising gas prices in 2008 with the us national average price per gallon of regular unleaded gas rising above $4.00 at one point  77  there has been a steady movement towards developing higher fuel efficiency and more alternative fuel vehicles for consumers  in response  many smaller companies have rapidly increased research and development into radically different ways of powering consumer vehicles  hybrid and battery electric vehicles are commercially available and are gaining wider industry and consumer acceptance worldwide  78   for example  nissan usa introduced the world s first mass-production electric vehicle  nissan leaf   79  a plug-in hybrid car  the  chevrolet volt  also has been produced  using an electric motor to drive the wheels  and a small four-cylinder engine to generate additional electricity  80   before alternative energy becomes mainstream there are a few crucial obstacles that it must overcome  first there must be increased understanding of how alternative energies are beneficial  secondly the availability components for these systems must increase  and lastly the pay-back period must be decreased   for example  electric vehicles  ev  and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles  phev  are on the rise  these vehicles depend on investment in home and public charging infrastructure  as well as implementing much more alternative energy for future transportation  81   there are numerous organizations within the academic  federal  and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of alternative energy  this research spans several areas of focus across the alternative energy spectrum  most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields  82   in the us  multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on alternative energy in recent years  two of the most prominent of these labs are sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory  nrel   both of which are funded by the united states department of energy and supported by various corporate partners  83  sandia has a total budget of $2.4 billion 84  while nrel has a budget of $375 million  85   mechanical energy associated with human activities such as blood circulation  respiration  walking  typing and running etc  is ubiquitous but usually wasted  it has attracted tremendous attention from researchers around the globe to find methods to scavenge such mechanical energies  the best solution currently is to use piezoelecric materials  which can generate flow of electrons when deformed  various devices using piezoelectric materials have been built to scavenge mechanical energy  considering that the piezoelectric constant of the material plays a critical role in the overall performance of a piezoelectric device  one critical research direction to improve device efficiency is to find new material of large piezoelectric response  lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate  pmn-pt  is a next-generation piezoelectric material with super high piezoelectric constant when ideal composition and orientation are obtained  in 2012  pmn-pt nanowires with a very high piezoelectric constant were fabricated by a hydro-thermal approach 14  and then assembled into an energy-harvesting device 15   the record-high piezoelectric constant was further improved by the fabrication of a single-crystal pmn-pt nanobelt  86  which was then used as the essential building block for a piezoelectric nanogenerator   solar energy can be used for heating  cooling or electrical power generation using the sun   solar heat has long been employed in passively and actively heated buildings  as well as district heating systems  examples of the latter are the drake landing solar community is alberta  canada and numerous district systems in denmark 87  and germany  88  in europe  there are two programs for the application of solar heat  the solar district heating (sdh  89  and the international energy agency s solar heating and cooling  shc  program  90   the obstacles preventing the large scale implementation of solar powered energy generation is the inefficiency of current solar technology  and the cost  currently  photovoltaic  pv  panels only have the ability to convert around 16  of the sunlight that hits them into electricity  91   both sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory  nrel   have heavily funded solar research programs  the nrel solar program has a budget of around $75 million 92  and develops research projects in the areas of photovoltaic  pv  technology  solar thermal energy  and solar radiation  93  the budget for sandia u2019s solar division is unknown  however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratory u2019s $2.4 billion budget  94   several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years  the solar energy research center  serc  at university of north carolina  unc  has the sole purpose of developing cost effective solar technology  in 2008  researchers at massachusetts institute of technology  mit  developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water  95  such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining   in february 2012  north carolina-based semprius inc   a solar development company backed by german corporation siemens  announced that they had developed the world u2019s most efficient solar panel  the company claims that the prototype converts 33.9  of the sunlight that hits it to electricity  more than double the previous high-end conversion rate  96   wind energy research dates back several decades to the 1970s when nasa developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds  97  today  both sandia national laboratories and national renewable energy laboratory have programs dedicated to wind research  sandia u2019s laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials  aerodynamics  and sensors  98  the nrel wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production  reducing their capital costs  and making wind energy more cost effective overall  99   the field laboratory for optimized wind energy  flowe  at caltech was established to research alternative approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost  size  and environmental impact of wind energy production  100   renewable energies such as wind  solar  biomass and geothermal combined  supplied 1.3  of global final energy consumption in 2013.[101   biomass can be regarded as  biological material  102  derived from living  or recently living organisms  it most often refers to plants or plant-derived materials which are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass  103  as an energy source  biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat  or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel  conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into  thermal  chemical  and biochemical methods  wood remains the largest biomass energy source today  104  examples include forest residues  such as dead trees  branches and tree stumps   yard clippings  wood chips and even municipal solid waste  in the second sense  biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals  including biofuels  industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants  including miscanthus  switchgrass  hemp  corn  poplar  willow  sorghum  sugarcane  bamboo  105  and a variety of tree species  ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm  palm oil    biomass  biogas and biofuels are burned to produce heat power and in doing so harm the environment  pollutants such as sulphurous oxides  sox   nitrous oxides  nox   and particulate matter  pm  are produced from this combustion  the world health organisation estimates that 7 million premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution  106  and biomass combustion is a major contributor of it  106][107][108  the use of biomas is carbon neutral over time  but is otherwise similar to burning fossil fuels   as the primary source of biofuels in north america  many organizations are conducting research in the area of ethanol production  on the federal level  the usda conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the united states  much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets  109   the national renewable energy laboratory has conducted various ethanol research projects  mainly in the area of cellulosic ethanol  110  cellulosic ethanol has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol  it does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood  grasses  or non-edible parts of plants  111  moreover  some studies have shown cellulosic ethanol to be more cost effective and economically sustainable than corn-based ethanol  112  sandia national laboratories conducts in-house cellulosic ethanol research 113  and is also a member of the joint bioenergy institute  jbei   a research institute founded by the united states department of energy with the goal of developing cellulosic biofuels  114   from 1978 to 1996  the national renewable energy laboratory experimented with using algae as a biofuels source in the  aquatic species program  u201d citation needed  a self-published article by michael briggs  at the university of new hampshire biofuels group  offers estimates for the realistic replacement of all motor vehicle fuel with biofuels by utilizing algae that have a natural oil content greater than 50   which briggs suggests can be grown on algae ponds at wastewater treatment plants  citation needed  this oil-rich algae can then be extracted from the system and processed into biofuels  with the dried remainder further reprocessed to create ethanol   the production of algae to harvest oil for biofuels has not yet been undertaken on a commercial scale  but feasibility studies have been conducted to arrive at the above yield estimate  in addition to its projected high yield  algaculture u2014 unlike food crop-based biofuels \u2014 does not entail a decrease in food production  since it requires neither farmland nor fresh water  many companies are pursuing algae bio-reactors for various purposes  including scaling up biofuels production to commercial levels  115][116   several groups in various sectors are conducting research on jatropha curcas  a poisonous shrub-like tree that produces seeds considered by many to be a viable source of biofuels feedstock oil  117  much of this research focuses on improving the overall per acre oil yield of jatropha through advancements in genetics  soil science  and horticultural practices  sg biofuels  a san diego-based jatropha developer  has used molecular breeding and biotechnology to produce elite hybrid seeds of jatropha that show significant yield improvements over first generation varieties  118  the center for sustainable energy farming  cfsef  is a los angeles-based non-profit research organization dedicated to jatropha research in the areas of plant science  agronomy  and horticulture  successful exploration of these disciplines is projected to increase jatropha farm production yields by 200-300  in the next ten years  119   geothermal energy is produced by tapping into the heat within the earths crust  it is considered sustainable because that thermal energy is constantly replenished  120  however  the science of geothermal energy generation is still young and developing economic viability  several entities  such as the national renewable energy laboratory 121  and sandia national laboratories 122  are conducting research toward the goal of establishing a proven science around geothermal energy  the international centre for geothermal research  igc   a german geosciences research organization  is largely focused on geothermal energy development research  123   over $1 billion has been spent on the research and development of hydrogen fuel in the united states  124  both the national renewable energy laboratory 125  and sandia national laboratories 126  have departments dedicated to hydrogen research  much of this work centers on hydrogen storage and fuel cell technologies  the generation of alternative energy on the scale needed to replace fossil energy  in an effort to reverse global climate change  is likely to have significant negative environmental impacts  for example  biomass energy generation would have to increase 7-fold to supply current primary energy demand  and up to 40-fold by 2100 given economic and energy growth projections  127  humans already appropriate 30 to 40  of all photosynthetically fixed carbon worldwide  indicating that expansion of additional biomass harvesting is likely to stress ecosystems  in some cases precipitating collapse and extinction of animal species that have been deprived of vital food sources  128][129  the total amount of energy capture by vegetation in the united states each year is around 58 quads (61.5 ej   about half of which is already harvested as agricultural crops and forest products  the remaining biomass is needed to maintain ecosystem functions and diversity  130  since annual energy use in the united states is ca  100 quads  biomass energy could supply only a very small fraction  to supply the current worldwide energy demand solely with biomass would require more than 10  of the earth u2019s land surface  which is comparable to the area use for all of world agriculture  i e   ca  1500 million hectares   indicating that further expansion of biomass energy generation will be difficult without precipitating an ethical conflict  given current world hunger statistics  over growing plants for biofuel versus food  131][132   given environmental concerns  e g   fish migration  destruction of sensitive aquatic ecosystems  etc   about building new dams to capture hydroelectric energy  further expansion of conventional hydropower in the united states is unlikely  windpower  if deployed on the large scale necessary to substitute fossil energy  is likely to face public resistance  if 100  of u s  energy demand were to be supplied by windmills  about 80 million hectares  i e   more than 40  of all available farmland in the united states  would have to be covered with large windmills (50m hub height and 250 to 500 m apart   133  it is therefore not surprising that the major environmental impact of wind power is related to land use and less to wildlife  birds  bats  etc   mortality  unless only a relatively small fraction of electricity is generated by windmills in remote locations  it is unlikely that the public will tolerate large windfarms given concerns about blade noise and aesthetics  134][135   biofuels are different from fossil fuels in regard to net greenhouse gases but are similar to fossil fuels in that biofuels contribute to air pollution  burning produces airborne carbon particulates  carbon monoxide and nitrous oxides  136   renewable alternative forms of energy have faced opposition from multiple groups  including conservatives and liberals  around twelve states have passed proposals written to inhibit the alternative energy movement  kansas lawmakers struck down a bill to phase out renewable energy mandates but face the possibility of the bill reappearing  137   the opposition cites the potentially high cost of branching out to these alternatives in order to support the continuation and reliance on fossil fuels  ohio s mandate to phase in alternative energy faces opposition who believe higher electricity prices will result  while supporters fear the loss of economic development and jobs that alternative energy could bring  137   with nuclear meltdowns in chernobyl and fukushima  nuclear power presents a constant danger and is more unlikely to be a useful alternative source  the costs of maintaining nuclear facilities  the potential risk of meltdowns  and the cost of cleaning up meltdowns are cited as reasons behind the movement away from the use of nuclear energy  nuclear power plants cannot compete with fossil fuels currently due to the latter s lower price and availability  nuclear power plants also face competition from the increasing renewable energy market  138  not in citation given   renewable energy does have some setbacks when relying on them completely  spikes in electricity bills occurred in southern australia when wind was not powering the turbines responsible for a large portion of the regions power  this led to the government to reintegrate a gas-powered station to supply power while the wind turbines were unable to  138   solar energy is the fastest growing and one of the most renowned form of alternative energy today  citation needed  solar panels are an icon of the  green power  movement  however the process of manufacturing the quartz based panels can be detrimental to the environment  raw quartz  silica  is used to create solar cells must be mined using harsh chemicals that harm the surrounding environment  as well as those working in the mines  silicosis is a form of lung disease that is caused by the inhalation of crystalline silica dust resulting in nodule lesions in the lungs  the silica must be cultivated into metallurgical-grade silicon  the process requiring a massive amount of energy as the quartz is placed into furnaces heated with fossil fuels  139  the metallurgical grade silica must be processed into polysilicon  this process also produces tetrachloride  a toxic substance that  if not disposed of correctly  can be harmful to the surrounding environment  hydrochloric acid is formed when tetrachloride interacts with water  raising water and soil ph  incidents of tetrachloride spills are common in china  as the production of solar panels has shifted from europe and the united states to asian countries within the early 2000 s  because of such  the villagers of gaolong are unable to leave their homes due to air and soil becoming toxic  this was due to luoyang zhongui high-technology co  repeatedly dumped tetrachloride in a nearby field for almost a year  140
