Capacityfactor
 the net capacity factor is the unitless ratio of an actual electrical energy output over a given period of time to the maximum possible electrical energy output over the same amount of time  1  the capacity factor is defined for any electricity producing installation  i e  a fuel consuming power plant or one using renewable energy  such as wind or the sun  the capacity factor is thus defined also for any class of such installations  and can be used to compare different types of electricity production  the maximum possible energy output of a given installation assumes its continuous operation at full nameplate capacity over the relevant period of time  the actual energy output over the same period of time and with it the capacity factor varies greatly depending on a range of factors  as such  the capacity factor can never exceed the availability factor  i e  the fraction of downtime due to for example reliability issues and maintenance both scheduled and unscheduled  other factors include the design of the installation  its location  the overall type of electricity production and with it either the fuel being used or for renewable energy the local weather conditions  additionally  the capacity factor can be subject to regulatory constraints and market forces potentially affecting both its fuel purchase and its electricity sale   to gain insight into seasonal fluctuations the capacity factor can be computed on a monthly basis  see the illustration  otherwise it is often computed over a timescale of a year averaging out most temporal fluctuations  alternatively  it be computed over the lifetime of the power source  both while operational and after decommissioning   the capacity factor has some relation to but is different from the capacity credit  firm capacity   efficiency or cost of energy       nuclear power plants are at the high end of the range of capacity factors  ideally reduced only by the availability factor  i e  maintenance and refueling  the largest nuclear plant in the us  palo verde nuclear generating station has between its three reactors a nameplate capacity of 3,942\xa0mw  as of 2010 update  its annual generation was 31,200,000\xa0mwh  2  leading to a capacity factor of  each of palo verde u2019s three reactors is refueled every 18 months  with one refueling every spring and fall  in 2014  a refueling was completed in a record 28 days  3  compared to the 35 days of downtime that the 2010 capacity factor corresponds to   the danish offshore wind farm horns rev 2  the world s largest at its inauguration in 2009,[4  has a nameplate capacity of 209.3\xa0mw   as of january 2017 update  it has since its commissioning 7.3 years ago produced 6416\xa0gwh  i e  an average annual production of 875\xa0gwh year and a capacity factor of  sites with lower capacity factors may be deemed feasible for wind farms  for example the onshore 1\xa0gw fosen vind which as of 2017 update  is under construction in norway has a projected capacity factor of 39    certain onshore wind farms can reach capacity factors of over 60   for example the 44 mw eolo plant in nicaragua had a net generation of 232.132 mwh in 2015  equivalent to a capacity factor of 60.2%.[6   since the capacity factor of a wind turbine measures actual production relative to possible production it is not constrained by betz s coefficient of 16/27 \n n n n u2248 n n n   displaystyle   approx   n n 59.3   which limits production vs  energy available in the wind   as of 2017 update  the three gorges dam in china is with its nameplate capacity of 22,500\xa0mw the largest power generating station in the world by installed capacity  in 2015 it generated 87\xa0twh  for a capacity factor of  hoover dam has a nameplate capacity of 2080 mw 7  and an annual generation averaging 4.2\xa0tw xb7h  7   the annual generation has varied between a high of 10.348\xa0tw xb7h in 1984  and a low of 2.648\xa0tw xb7h in 1956.[7   taking the average figure for annual generation gives a capacity factor of   at the low range of capacity factors is the photovoltaic power station  which supplies power to the electricity grid from a large-scale photovoltaic system  pv system   an inherent limit to its capacity factor comes from its requirement of daylight  preferably with a sun unobstructed by clouds  smoke or smog  shade from trees and building structures  since the amount of sunlight varies both with the time of the day and the seasons of the year  the capacity factor is typically computed on an annual basis  the amount of available sunlight is mostly determined by the latitude of the installation  but also influenced by local factors  such as indirect light reflected from a nearby body of water  the actual production is also influenced by local factors such as dust and ambient temperature  which ideally should be low  as for any power station  the maximum possible power production is the nameplate capacity times the number of hours in a year  while the actual production is the amount of electricity delivered annually to the grid   for example  agua caliente solar project  located in arizona near the 33rd parallel and awarded for its excellence in renewable energy has a nameplate capacity of 290\xa0mw and an actual  average annual production of 740\xa0gwh year   its capacity factor is thus   a significantly lower capacity factor is achieved by lauingen energy park located in bavaria near the 49th parallel  with a nameplate capacity of 25.7\xa0mw and an actual  average annual production of 26.98\xa0gwh year for a capacity factor of 12.0    there are several reasons why a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100   the first reason is that it was out of service or operating at reduced output for part of the time due to equipment failures or routine maintenance  this accounts for most of the unused capacity of base load power plants  base load plants have the lowest costs per unit of electricity because they are designed for maximum efficiency and are operated continuously at high output  geothermal plants  nuclear plants  coal-fired plants and bioenergy plants that burn solid material are almost always operated as base load plants   the second reason that a plant would have a capacity factor lower than 100  is that output is curtailed or intentionally left idle because the electricity is not needed or because the price of electricity is too low to make production economical  this accounts for most of the unused capacity of peaking power plants  peaking plants may operate for only a few hours per year or up to several hours per day  their electricity is relatively expensive  many other power plants operate only at certain times of the day or times of the year because of variation in loads and electricity prices  if a plant is only needed during the day  for example  even if it operates at full power output from 8 am to 8 pm every day all year long  it would only have a 50  capacity factor  e g   a third reason is that a plant may not have the fuel available to operate all of the time  this can apply to fossil generating stations with restricted fuels supplies  but most notably applies to intermittent renewable resources  when the sun isn t shining  solar pv cannot produce electricity  when the wind is not blowing  wind turbines cannot produce electricity  solar pv and wind turbines have a capacity factor limited by the availability of their  fuel   sunshine and wind respectively   a hydroelectricity plant may have a capacity factor lower than 100  due to scarcity of water  however  its output may also simply be regulated to match the current power need  conserving its stored water for later usage  a hydroelectricity plant may also be designed for reverse usage so it can pump water up in its reservoir in situations with a power surplus  in both cases the use of the hydroelectricity plant to stabilize the grid reduces its capacity factor  hydroelectricity may have a higher capacity factor with respect to the turbine size since in some case the amount of stored water fluctuates to account for intermittent availability of water   other reasons that a power plant may not have a capacity factor of 100  include restrictions or limitations on air permits and limitations on transmission that force the plant to curtail output   load following power plants  also called intermediate power plants  are between base load and peaking plants in terms of capacity factor  efficiency and cost per unit of electricity  they produce most of their electricity during the day  when prices and demand are highest  however  the demand and price of electricity is far lower during the night and intermediate plants shutdown or reduce their output to low levels overnight   when it comes to several renewable energy sources such as solar power  wind power and hydroelectricity  there is a fourth reason for unused capacity  the plant may be capable of producing electricity  but its  fuel   wind  sunlight or water  may not be available  a hydroelectric plant s production may also be affected by requirements to keep the water level from getting too high or low and to provide water for fish downstream  however  solar  wind and hydroelectric plants do have high availability factors  so when they have fuel available  they are almost always able to produce electricity  8   when hydroelectric plants have water available  they are also useful for load following  because of their high dispatchability  a typical hydroelectric plant s operators can bring it from a stopped condition to full power in just a few minutes   wind farms are variable  due to the natural variability of the wind  for a wind farm  the capacity factor is mostly determined by the availability of wind  transmission line capacity and electricity demand also affect the capacity factor  typical capacity factors of current wind farms are between 25 and 45   though current 110 meter towers can have up to 55  capacity factor  and future 140 meter towers are expected to have up to 65  capacity factor  9   solar energy is variable because of the daily rotation of the earth  seasonal changes  and because of cloud cover  according to  10  the sacramento municipal utility district observed a 15  capacity factor in 2005  however  according to the solarpaces programme of the international energy agency  iea   solar power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands  such as spain or the south-western united states  11  although in some locations solar pv does not reduce the need for generation of network upgrades given that air conditioner peak demand often occurs in the late afternoon or early evening when solar output is reduced  12][13  solarpaces states that by using thermal energy storage systems the operating periods of solar thermal power  csp  stations can be extended to become dispatchable  load following   11  the iea csp technology roadmap (2010  suggests that  in the sunniest countries  csp can be expected to become a competitive source of bulk power in peak and intermediate loads by 2020  and of base-load power by 2025 to 2030".[14  a dispatchable source is more valuable than baseload power  15   geothermal has a higher capacity factor than many other power sources  and geothermal resources are available 24 hours a day  7 days a week  while the carrier medium for geothermal electricity  water  must be properly managed  the source of geothermal energy  the earth s heat  will be available for the foreseeable future  16  geothermal power can be looked at as a nuclear battery where the heat is produced via the decay of radioactive elements in the core and mantle of the earth   according to the us energy information administration  eia   in 2009 the capacity factors were as follows  17   however  these values often vary significantly by month   the following figures were collected by the department of energy and climate change on the capacity factors for various types of plants in uk grid
