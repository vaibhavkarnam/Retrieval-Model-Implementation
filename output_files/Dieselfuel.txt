 diesel fuel /\u02c8di u02d0z u0259l  in general is any liquid fuel used in diesel engines  whose fuel ignition takes place  without any spark  as a result of compression of the inlet air mixture and then injection of fuel   glow plugs  grid heaters and heater blocks help achieve high temperatures for combustion during engine startup in cold weather   diesel engines have found broad use as a result of higher thermodynamic efficiency and thus fuel efficiency  this is particularly noted where diesel engines are run at part-load  as their air supply is not throttled as in a petrol engine  their efficiency still remains very high   the most common type of diesel fuel is a specific fractional distillate of petroleum fuel oil  but alternatives that are not derived from petroleum  such as biodiesel  biomass to liquid  btl  or gas to liquid  gtl  diesel  are increasingly being developed and adopted  to distinguish these types  petroleum-derived diesel is increasingly called petrodiesel  1  ultra-low-sulfur diesel  ulsd  is a standard for defining diesel fuel with substantially lowered sulfur contents  as of 2016  almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in uk  europe and north america is of a ulsd type  in the uk  diesel fuel for on-road use is commonly abbreviated derv  standing for diesel-engined road vehicle  which carries a tax premium over equivalent fuel for non-road use  see \xa7\xa0taxation   2  in australia diesel fuel is also known as distillate  3  and in indonesia  it is known as solar  a trademarked name by the local oil company pertamina       diesel fuel originated from experiments conducted by german scientist and inventor rudolf diesel for his compression-ignition engine he invented in 1892  diesel originally designed his engine to use coal dust as fuel  4  and experimented with other fuels including vegetable oils 5  such as peanut oil  which was used to power the engines which he exhibited at the 1900 paris exposition and the 1911 world s fair in paris  6   diesel fuel is produced from various sources  the most common being petroleum  other sources include biomass  animal fat  biogas  natural gas  and coal liquefaction   petroleum diesel  also called petrodiesel  7  or fossil diesel is the most common type of diesel fuel  it is produced from the fractional distillation of crude oil between 200\xa0\xb0c (392\xa0\xb0f  and 350\xa0\xb0c (662\xa0\xb0f  at atmospheric pressure  resulting in a mixture of carbon chains that typically contain between 8 and 21 carbon atoms per molecule  8   synthetic diesel can be produced from any carbonaceous material  including biomass  biogas  natural gas  coal and many others  the raw material is gasified into synthesis gas  which after purification is converted by the fischer u2013tropsch process to a synthetic diesel  9   the process is typically referred to as biomass-to-liquid  btl   gas-to-liquid  gtl  or coal-to-liquid  ctl   depending on the raw material used   paraffinic synthetic diesel generally has a near-zero content of sulfur and very low aromatics content  reducing unregulated emissions of toxic hydrocarbons  nitrous oxides and particulate matter (pm   10   fatty-acid methyl ester  fame   more widely known as biodiesel  is obtained from vegetable oil or animal fats  biolipids  which have been transesterified with methanol  it can be produced from many types of oils  the most common being rapeseed oil  rapeseed methyl ester  rme  in europe and soybean oil  soy methyl ester  sme  in the us  methanol can also be replaced with ethanol for the transesterification process  which results in the production of ethyl esters  the transesterification processes use catalysts  such as sodium or potassium hydroxide  to convert vegetable oil and methanol into fame and the undesirable byproducts glycerine and water  which will need to be removed from the fuel along with methanol traces  fame can be used pure (b100  in engines where the manufacturer approves such use  but it is more often used as a mix with diesel  bxx where xx is the biodiesel content in percent  11][12   fame as a fuel is specified in din en 14214[13  and astm d6751.[14   fuel equipment manufacturers  fie  have raised several concerns regarding fame fuels  identifying fame as being the cause of the following problems  corrosion of fuel injection components  low-pressure fuel system blockage  increased dilution and polymerization of engine sump oil  pump seizures due to high fuel viscosity at low temperature  increased injection pressure  elastomeric seal failures and fuel injector spray blockage  15  pure biodiesel has an energy content about 5\u201310  lower than petroleum diesel  16  the loss in power when using pure biodiesel is 5\u20137%.[12   unsaturated fatty acids are the source for the lower oxidation stability  they react with oxygen and form peroxides and result in degradation byproducts  which can cause sludge and lacquer in the fuel system  17   as fame contains low levels of sulfur  the emissions of sulfur oxides and sulfates  major components of acid rain  are low  use of biodiesel also results in reductions of unburned hydrocarbons  carbon monoxide  co   and particulate matter  co emissions using biodiesel are substantially reduced  on the order of 50  compared to most petrodiesel fuels  the exhaust emissions of particulate matter from biodiesel have been found to be 30  lower than overall particulate matter emissions from petrodiesel  the exhaust emissions of total hydrocarbons  a contributing factor in the localized formation of smog and ozone  are up to 93  lower for biodiesel than diesel fuel   biodiesel also may reduce health risks associated with petroleum diesel  biodiesel emissions showed decreased levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon  pah  and nitrited pah compounds  which have been identified as potential cancer-causing compounds  in recent testing  pah compounds were reduced by 75\u201385   except for benz a anthracene  which was reduced by roughly 50   targeted npah compounds were also reduced dramatically with biodiesel fuel  with 2-nitrofluorene and 1-nitropyrene reduced by 90   and the rest of the npah compounds reduced to only trace levels  18   this category of diesel fuels involves converting the triglycerides in vegetable oil and animal fats into alkanes by refining and hydrogenation  such as h-bio  the produced fuel has many properties that are similar to synthetic diesel  and are free from the many disadvantages of fame   dimethyl ether  dme  is a synthetic  gaseous diesel fuel that results in clean combustion with very little soot and reduced nox emissions  11   in the us  diesel is recommended to be stored in a yellow container to differentiate it from kerosene and gasoline  which are typically kept in blue and red containers  respectively  19  in the uk  diesel is normally stored in a black container  to differentiate it from unleaded petrol  which is commonly stored in a green container  and leaded petrol  which is stored in a red container   20   the principal measure of diesel fuel quality is its cetane number  a cetane number is a measure of the delay of ignition of a diesel fuel  21  a higher cetane number indicates that the fuel ignites more readily when sprayed into hot compressed air  21  european  en 590 standard  road diesel has a minimum cetane number of 51  fuels with higher cetane numbers  normally  premium  diesel fuels with additional cleaning agents and some synthetic content  are available in some markets   as of 2010  the density of petroleum diesel is about 0.832\xa0kg l (6.943\xa0lb us xa0gal   about 11.6  more than ethanol-free petrol  gasoline   which has a density of about 0.745\xa0kg l (6.217\xa0lb us xa0gal   about 86.1  of the fuel mass is carbon  and when burned  it offers a net heating value of 43.1 mj kg as opposed to 43.2 mj kg for gasoline  however  due to the higher density  diesel offers a higher volumetric energy density at 35.86 mj l (128,700\xa0btu us xa0gal  vs  32.18 mj l (115,500\xa0btu us xa0gal  for gasoline  some 11  higher  which should be considered when comparing the fuel efficiency by volume  the co2 emissions from diesel are 73.25 g mj  just slightly lower than for gasoline at 73.38 g mj  22  diesel is generally simpler to refine from petroleum than gasoline  and contains hydrocarbons having a boiling point in the range of 180\u2013360\xa0\xb0c (360\u2013680\xa0\xb0f   the price of diesel traditionally rises during colder months as demand for heating oil rises  which is refined in much the same way  because of recent changes in fuel quality regulations  additional refining is required to remove sulfur  which contributes to a sometimes higher cost  in many parts of the united states and throughout the united kingdom and australia  23  diesel may be priced higher than petrol  24  clarification needed  reasons for higher-priced diesel include the shutdown of some refineries in the gulf of mexico  diversion of mass refining capacity to gasoline production  and a recent transfer to ultra-low-sulfur diesel  ulsd   which causes infrastructural complications  25  in sweden  a diesel fuel designated as mk-1  class 1 environmental diesel  is also being sold  this is a ulsd that also has a lower aromatics content  with a limit of 5%.[26  this fuel is slightly more expensive to produce than regular ulsd   diesel fuel is very similar to heating oil  which is used in central heating  in europe  the united states  and canada  taxes on diesel fuel are higher than on heating oil due to the fuel tax  and in those areas  heating oil is marked with fuel dyes and trace chemicals to prevent and detect tax fraud   untaxed  diesel  sometimes called  off-road diesel   is available in some countries for use primarily in agricultural applications  such as fuel for tractors  recreational and utility vehicles or other noncommercial vehicles that do not use public roads  this fuel may have sulfur levels that exceed the limits for road use in some countries  e g  us    this untaxed diesel is dyed red for identification  27  and using this untaxed diesel fuel for a typically taxed purpose  such as driving use   the user can be fined  e g  us 10,000 in the us   in the united kingdom  belgium and the netherlands  it is known as red diesel  or gas oil   and is also used in agricultural vehicles  home heating tanks  refrigeration units on vans trucks which contain perishable items such as food and medicine and for marine craft  diesel fuel  or marked gas oil is dyed green in the republic of ireland and norway  the term  diesel-engined road vehicle   derv  is used in the uk as a synonym for unmarked road diesel fuel  in india  taxes on diesel fuel are lower than on petrol  as the majority of the transportation for grain and other essential commodities across the country runs on diesel   taxes on biodiesel in the us vary between states  some states  texas  for example  have no tax on biodiesel and a reduced tax on biodiesel blends equivalent to the amount of biodiesel in the blend  so that b20 fuel is taxed 20  less than pure petrodiesel  28  other states  such as north carolina  tax biodiesel  in any blended configuration  the same as petrodiesel  although they have introduced new incentives to producers and users of all biofuels  29   unlike gasoline and liquefied petroleum gas engines  diesel engines do not use high-voltage spark ignition  spark plugs   an engine running on diesel compresses the air inside the cylinder to high pressures and temperatures  compression ratios from 14:1 to 18:1 are common in current diesel engines   the engine generally injects the diesel fuel directly into the cylinder  starting a few degrees before top dead center  tdc  and continuing during the combustion event  the high temperatures inside the cylinder cause the diesel fuel to react with the oxygen in the mix  burn or oxidize   heating and expanding the burning mixture to convert the thermal pressure difference into mechanical work  i e   to move the piston  engines have glow plugs and grid heaters to help start the engine by preheating the cylinders to a minimum operating temperature  diesel engines are lean burn engines  30  burning the fuel in more air than is needed for the chemical reaction  they thus use less fuel than rich burn spark ignition engines which use a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio  just enough air to react with the fuel   as professor harvey of the university of toronto notes   due to the absence of throttling  constant amount of air admitted  per unit fuel  with no user-determined variation   and the high compression ratio and lean fuel mixture  diesel engines are substantially more efficient than spark-ignited engines   generally  harvey cites the side-by-side comparisons of schipper et al  and the estimates of &gt 20  lower fuel use and  given differences in energy content between fuel types  &gt 15  lower energy use  31  gas turbine and some other types of internal combustion engines  and external combustion engine  both can also be designed to take diesel fuel  citation needed   the viscosity requirement of diesel fuel is usually specified at 40\xa0\xb0c  21  a disadvantage of diesel as a vehicle fuel in cold climates  is that its viscosity increases as the temperature decreases  changing it into a gel  see compression ignition \u2013 gelling  that cannot flow in fuel systems  special low-temperature diesel contains additives to keep it liquid at lower temperatures  but starting a diesel engine in very cold weather may still pose considerable difficulties  another disadvantage of diesel engines compared to petrol gasoline engines is the possibility of diesel engine runaway failure  since diesel engines do not need spark ignition  they can run as long as diesel fuel is supplied  fuel is typically supplied via a fuel pump  if the pump breaks down in an  open  position  the supply of fuel will be unrestricted  and the engine will run away and risk terminal failure  32   with turbocharged engines  the oil seals on the turbocharger may fail  allowing lubricating oil into the combustion chamber  where it is burned like regular diesel fuel  in vehicles or installations that use diesel engines and also bottled gas  a gas leak into the engine room could also provide fuel for a runaway  via the engine air intake  33   the crank case ventilation of modern road-use diesel engines is diverted into the intake manifold  because ventilating the crank case into outside air is inadvisable due to lubricant mist it contains  if the engine s piston rings malfunction  this will cause excessive pressure in the crank case forcing mist of engine lubricant into the intake manifold  since most engines use oil which can be burnt in the same fashion as diesel  this will result in diesel engine runaway  to prevent that  more premium crank case ventilation solutions are fitted with a filter to catch out lubricant mist   most modern road use diesel engines are provided with an frp valve in the intake manifold  usually mistaken by some as a petrol engine throttle body   in most basic applications this valve will close a flow of air mixture to the engine when the vehicle is switched off  preventing diesel engine runaway by starving the engine of oxygen  this will also make standard shutdown much smoother by eliminating compression and decompression rattle by making the pistons effectively work in vacuum  in more advanced control systems this frp valve can be shut by an electronic control unit when it senses runaway scenario   diesel fuel is widely used in most types of transportation  trucks and buses  which were often gasoline-powered in the 1920s through 1950s  are now almost exclusively diesel-powered  the gasoline-powered passenger automobile is the major exception  diesel cars are less numerous worldwide   diesel displaced coal and fuel oil for steam-powered vehicles in the latter half of the 20th century  and is now used almost exclusively for the combustion engines of self-powered rail vehicles  locomotives and railcars   34][35   the first diesel-powered flight of a fixed-wing aircraft took place on the evening of 18 september 1928  at the packard proving grounds near utica  michigan  with captain lionel m  woolson and walter lees at the controls the first  official  test flight was taken the next morning  flying a stinson sm1b (x7654   powered by a packard dr-980 9-cylinder diesel radial engine  designed by woolson  charles lindbergh flew the same aircraft and in 1929  it was flown 621 miles (999\xa0km  nonstop from detroit to langley field  near norfolk  virginia  in 1931  walter lees and fredrick brossy set the nonstop flight record flying a bellanca powered by a packard diesel for 84 hours and 32 minutes  x7654 is now owned by greg herrick and is at the golden wings flying museum near minneapolis  minnesota   diesel engines for airships were developed in both germany and the united kingdom by daimler-benz and beardmore produced the daimler-benz db 602 and beardmore typhoon respectively  the lz 129 hindenburg rigid airship was powered by four daimler-benz db 602 16-cylinder diesel engines  each with 1,200\xa0hp (890\xa0kw  available in bursts and 850 horsepower (630\xa0kw  available for cruising  36  the beardmore typhoon powered the ill-fated r101 airship  built for the empire airship programme in 1931   with a production run of at least 900 engines  the most-produced aviation diesel engine in history was probably the junkers jumo 205  similar developments from the junkers motorenwerke and licence-built versions of the jumo 204 and jumo 205  boosted german diesel aero-engine production to at least 1000 examples  the vast majority of which were liquid-cooled  opposed-piston  two-stroke engines   in the soviet union significant progress towards practical diesel aero-engines was made by the tsiam  tsentral nyy institut aviatsionnovo motorostroyeniya \u2013 central institute of aviation motors  and particularly by a d  charomskiy  who nursed the charomskiy ach-30 into production and limited operational use  37   armored fighting vehicles use diesel because of its lower flammability risks and the engines  higher provision of torque and lower likelihood of stalling  38][39   diesel-powered cars generally have a better fuel economy than equivalent gasoline engines and produce less greenhouse gas emission  40  their greater economy is due to the higher energy per-litre content of diesel fuel and the intrinsic efficiency of the diesel engine  41  while petrodiesel s higher density results in higher greenhouse gas emissions per litre compared to gasoline  42  the 20\u201340  better fuel economy achieved by modern diesel-engined automobiles offsets the higher per-litre emissions of greenhouse gases  and a diesel-powered vehicle emits 10\u201320 percent less greenhouse gas than comparable gasoline vehicles  43][44][45  biodiesel-powered diesel engines offer substantially improved emission reductions compared to petrodiesel or gasoline-powered engines  while retaining most of the fuel economy advantages over conventional gasoline-powered automobiles  43  however  the increased compression ratios mean there are increased emissions of oxides of nitrogen  nox  from diesel engines  46  this is compounded by biological nitrogen in biodiesel to make nox emissions the main drawback of diesel versus gasoline engines  46   today s tractors and heavy equipment are mostly diesel-powered  among tractors  only the smaller classes may also offer gasoline engines  the dieselization of tractors and heavy equipment began in germany before world war ii but was unusual in the united states until after that war  during the 1950s and 1960s  it progressed in the us as well   tractors and heavy equipment were often multifuel in the 1920s through 1940s  running spark-ignition and low-compression engines  thus many farm tractors of the era could burn gasoline  alcohol  kerosene  and any light grade of fuel oil such as diesel fuel  heating oil  or tractor vaporising oil  according to whichever was most affordable in any region at any given time  on u s  farms during this era  the name  distillate  often referred to any of the aforementioned light fuel oils  the engines did not start as well on distillate  so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for cold starting  and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later  after warm-up  to switch to distillate  engine accessories such as vaporizers and radiator shrouds were also used  both with the aim of capturing heat  because when such an engine was run on distillate  it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature  dieselization with dedicated diesel engines  high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and compression ignition  replaced such systems and made more efficient use of the diesel fuel being burned   poor quality diesel fuel has been used as an extraction agent for liquid u2013liquid extraction of palladium from nitric acid mixtures  47  such use has been proposed as a means of separating the fission product palladium from purex raffinate which comes from used nuclear fuel  47  in this system of solvent extraction  the hydrocarbons of the diesel act as the diluent while the dialkyl sulfides act as the extractant  47  this extraction operates by a solvation mechanism  47  so far  neither a pilot plant nor full scale plant has been constructed to recover palladium  rhodium or ruthenium from nuclear wastes created by the use of nuclear fuel  48   diesel fuel is also often used as the main ingredient in oil-base mud drilling fluid  49  the advantage of using diesel is its low cost and that it delivers excellent results when drilling a wide variety of difficult strata including shale  salt and gypsum formations  49  diesel-oil mud is typically mixed with up to 40  brine water  50  due to health  safety and environmental concerns  diesel-oil mud is often replaced with vegetable  mineral  or synthetic food-grade oil-base drilling fluids  although diesel-oil mud is still in widespread use in certain regions  51   during development of rocket engines in germany during world war ii j-2 diesel fuel was used as the fuel component in several engines including the bmw 109-718.[52  j-2 diesel fuel was also used as a fuel for gas turbine engines  52   petroleum-derived diesel is composed of about 75  saturated hydrocarbons  primarily paraffins including n  iso  and cycloparaffins   and 25  aromatic hydrocarbons  including naphthalenes and alkylbenzenes   53  the average chemical formula for common diesel fuel is c12h23  ranging approximately from c10h20 to c15h28.[54   most diesel fuels freeze at common winter temperatures  while the temperatures greatly vary  55  petrodiesel typically freezes around temperatures of \u22128.1\xa0\xb0c (17.5\xa0\xb0f   whereas biodiesel freezes between temperatures of 2\xb0 to 15\xa0\xb0c (35\xb0 to 60\xa0\xb0f   55  the viscosity of diesel noticeably increases as the temperature decreases  changing it into a gel at temperatures of \u221219\xa0\xb0c (\u22122.2\xa0\xb0f  to \u221215\xa0\xb0c (5\xa0\xb0f   that cannot flow in fuel systems  conventional diesel fuels vaporise at temperatures between 149\xa0\xb0c and 371\xa0\xb0c  21   conventional diesel flash points vary between 52 and 96\xa0\xb0c  which makes it safer than petrol and unsuitable for spark-ignition engines  56  unlike petrol  the flash point of a diesel fuel has no relation to its performance in an engine nor to its auto ignition qualities  21   diesel engines as with other forms of combustion  produce the mono-nitrogen oxides no and no n2  collectively known as nox  nox reacts with ammonia  moisture  and other compounds to form nitric acid vapor and related particles  modern diesel engines  euro 6  amp  epa stds  use urea injetion to turn nox into n2 and water  a diesel engine produces a consistent level of nox over it s lifespan  a gasoline engine starts off cleaner than the diesel in nox terms but increases such that beyond 50,000 miles the gas petrol engine produces more nox than the equivalent diesel  57   small particles  particulate matter also known as pm 10 or pm 2.5 depending on size  can penetrate deeply into sensitive lung tissue and damage it  causing premature death in extreme cases  inhalation of such particles may cause or worsen respiratory diseases  such as emphysema or bronchitis  or may also aggravate existing heart disease  unlike direct injection gasoline petrol enignes  modern diesel engines are fitted with particulate traps that help to eliminate pm 10 and pm 2.5 [58   high levels of sulfur in diesel are harmful for the environment because they prevent the use of catalytic diesel particulate filters to control diesel particulate emissions  as well as more advanced technologies  such as nitrogen oxide  nox  adsorbers  still under development   to reduce emissions  moreover  sulfur in the fuel is oxidized during combustion  producing sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide  that in presence of water rapidly convert to sulfuric acid  one of the chemical processes that results in acid rain  however  the process for lowering sulfur also reduces the lubricity of the fuel  meaning that additives must be put into the fuel to help lubricate engines  biodiesel and biodiesel petrodiesel blends  with their higher lubricity levels  are increasingly being utilized as an alternative  the u s  annual consumption of diesel fuel in 2006 was about 190 billion litres (42 billion imperial gallons or 50 billion us gallons   59   in the past  diesel fuel contained higher quantities of sulfur  european emission standards and preferential taxation have forced oil refineries to dramatically reduce the level of sulfur in diesel fuels  in the european union  the sulfur content has dramatically reduced during the last 20 years  automotive diesel fuel is covered in the european union by standard en 590  in the 1990s specifications allowed a content of 2000 ppm max of sulphur  reduced to a limit of 350 ppm by the beginning of the 21st century with the introduction of euro 3 specifications  the limit was lowered with the introduction of euro 4 by 2006 to 50 ppm  ulsd  ultra low sulfur diesel   the standard currently in force in european europe for diesel fuel is the euro 5  with a maximum content of 10 ppm  citation needed   in the united states  more stringent emission standards have been adopted with the transition to ulsd starting in 2006  and becoming mandatory on june 1  2010  see also diesel exhaust   u s  diesel fuel typically also has a lower cetane number  a measure of ignition quality  than european diesel  resulting in worse cold weather performance and some increase in emissions  60   there has been much discussion and misunderstanding of algae in diesel fuel  algae need light to live and grow  as there is no sunlight in a closed fuel tank  no algae can survive  but some microbes can survive and feed on the diesel fuel  61   these microbes form a colony that lives at the interface of fuel and water  they grow quite fast in warmer temperatures  they can even grow in cold weather when fuel tank heaters are installed  parts of the colony can break off and clog the fuel lines and fuel filters  62   water in fuel can damage a fuel injection pump  some diesel fuel filters also trap water  water contamination in diesel fuel can lead to freezing while in the fuel tank  the freezing water that saturates the fuel will sometimes clog the fuel injector pump  63  once the water inside the fuel tank has started to freeze  gelling is more likely to occur  when the fuel is gelled it is not effective until the temperature is raised and the fuel returns to a liquid state   unlike gasoline petroleum spirit  diesel is not flammable  however a lack of evaporation means diesel spilled on a roadway can pose slip hazard to vehicles  64  due to its high evaporation temperature  after the light fractions have evaporated  a greasy slick is left on the road which can destabilize moving vehicles  causing them to skid  diesel spills severely reduce tire grip and traction  and have been implicated in many accidents  the loss of traction is similar to that encountered on black ice  diesel slicks are especially dangerous for two-wheeled vehicles such as motorcycles  citation needed
