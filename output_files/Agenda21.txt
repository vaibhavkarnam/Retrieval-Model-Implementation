half of the iclei s global membership of 1,200\xa0cities promoting sustainable development at a local level  9  the united states also has one of the most comprehensively documented agenda xa021 status reports  17  in response to the opposition  don knapp  u s  spokesman for the iclei  has said  sustainable development is not a top-down conspiracy from the u n   but a bottom-up push from local governments   13   the arizona chamber of commerce and industry successfully lobbied against an anti-sustainable development bill in 2012  arguing  it would be bad for business  as it could drive away corporations that have embraced sustainable development  13   during the last decade  opposition to agenda xa021 has increased within the united states at the local  state  and federal levels  18  the republican national committee has adopted a resolution opposing agenda 21  and the republican party platform stated that  we strongly reject the u n  agenda 21 as erosive of american sovereignty   19][20  several state and local governments have considered or passed motions and legislation opposing agenda xa021.[4][13][21][22][23][24  alabama became the first state to prohibit government participation in agenda xa021.[5  many other states  including arizona  are drafting  and close to passing legislation to ban agenda 21.[25   activists  some of whom have been associated with the tea party movement by the new york times and the huffington post  have said that agenda xa021 is a conspiracy by the united nations to deprive individuals of property rights  4][13
