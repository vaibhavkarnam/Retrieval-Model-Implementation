Batteryelectricvehicle
 a battery electric vehicle  bev   battery-only electric vehicle  boev  or all-electric vehicle is a type of electric vehicle  ev  that uses chemical energy stored in rechargeable battery packs  bevs use electric motors and motor controllers instead of internal combustion engines  ices  for propulsion  they derive all power from battery packs and thus have no internal combustion engine  fuel cell  or fuel tank  bevs include bicycles  scooters  skateboards  rail cars  watercraft  forklifts  buses  trucks and cars   cumulative global sales of highway-capable light-duty pure electric vehicles passed the one million unit milestone in september 2016.[3  as of december 2016 update   the world s top selling highway legal all-electric car in history is the nissan leaf with global sales of over 250,000 units  followed by the tesla model s with more than 158,000 units delivered worldwide  1][2       vehicles using both electric motors and internal combustion engines are examples of hybrid electric vehicles  and are not considered pure or all-electric vehicles because they cannot be externally charged  operate in charge-sustaining mode  and instead they are continually recharged with power from the internal combustion engine and regenerative braking  4   hybrid vehicles with batteries that can be charged externally to displace some or all of their internal combustion engine power and gasoline fuel are called plug-in hybrid electric vehicles  phev   and run as bevs during their charge-depleting mode  phevs with a series powertrain are also called range-extended electric vehicles  reevs   such as the chevrolet volt and fisker karma   plug-in electric vehicles  pevs  are a subcategory of electric vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles  bevs   plug-in hybrid vehicles   phevs   and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles  4][5   in china  plug-in electric vehicles  together with hybrid electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (nevs   6  however  in the united states  neighborhood electric vehicles  nevs  are battery electric vehicles that are legally limited to roads with posted speed limits no higher than 45 miles per hour (72\xa0km h   are usually built to have a top speed of 30 miles per hour (48\xa0km h   and have a maximum loaded weight of 3,000\xa0lbs  7   the concept of battery electric vehicles is to use charged batteries on board vehicles for propulsion  battery electric cars are becoming more and more attractive with the advancement of new battery technology  lithium ion  that have higher power and energy density  i e   greater possible acceleration and more range with fewer batteries  and higher oil prices  8   bevs include automobiles  light trucks  and neighborhood electric vehicles   chattanooga  tennessee operates nine zero-fare electric buses  which have been in operation since 1992 and have carried 11.3 million passengers and covered a distance of 3,100,000 kilometres (1,900,000\xa0mi   they were made locally by advanced vehicle systems  two of these buses were used for the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta  9][10   beginning in the summer of 2000  hong kong airport began operating a 16-passenger mitsubishi rosa electric shuttle bus  and in the fall of 2000  new york city began testing a 66-passenger battery-powered school bus  an all-electric version of the blue bird tc 2000.[11  a similar bus was operated in napa valley  california for 14 months ending in april  2004.[12   the 2008 beijing olympics used a fleet of 50 electric buses  which have a range of 130\xa0km (81\xa0mi  with the air conditioning on  they use lithium-ion batteries  and consume about 1\xa0kw xb7h mi (0.62\xa0kw xb7h km  2.2\xa0mj km   the buses were designed by the beijing institute of technology and built by the jinghua coach co  ltd  13  the batteries are replaced with fully charged ones at the recharging station to allow 24-hour operation of the buses  14   in france  the bus electric phenomenon is in development  but some buses are already operating in numerous cities  15  pvi  a medium company located in the paris region  is one of the leader of the market with its brand gepebus  offering oreos 2x and oreos 4x   16   in the united states  the first battery-electric  fast-charge bus has been in operation in pomona  california since september 2010 at foothill transit  the proterra ecoride be35 uses lithium-titanate batteries and is able to fast-charge in less than 10 minutes  17   in 2014  the first production model all-electric school bus was delivered to the kings canyon unified school district in california u2019s san joaquin valley  the bus was one of four the district ordered  this battery electric school bus  which has 4 sodium nickel batteries  is the first modern electric school bus approved for student transportation by any state  18   the same technology is used to power the mountain view community shuttles  this technology was supported by the california energy commission  and the shuttle program is being supported by google  19   thunder sky  based in hong kong  builds lithium-ion batteries used in submarines and has three models of electric buses  the 10/21 passenger ev-6700 with a range of 280\xa0km (170\xa0mi  under 20 mins quick-charge  the ev-2009 city buses  and the 43 passenger ev-2008 highway bus  which has a range of 300\xa0km (190\xa0mi  under quick-charge (20 mins to 80 percent   and 350\xa0km (220\xa0mi  under full charge (25 mins   the buses will also be built in the united states and finland  20   tindo is an all-electric bus from adelaide  australia  the tindo  aboriginal word for sun  is made by designline international 21  in new zealand and gets its electricity from a solar pv system on adelaide s central bus station  rides are zero-fare as part of adelaide s public transport system  22   proterra s ecoride be35 transit bus  called the ecoliner by foothill transit in west covina  california  is a heavy duty  fast charge  battery-electric bus  proterra s prodrive drive-system uses a uqm motor and regenerative braking that captures 90 percent of the available energy and returns it to the terravolt energy storage system  which in turn increases the total distance the bus can drive by 31\u201335 percent  it can travel 30\u201340 miles on a single charge  is up to 600 percent more fuel-efficient than a typical diesel or cng bus  and produces 44 percent less carbon than cng  23   for most of the 20th century  the majority of the world s battery electric road vehicles were british milk floats  24   in march 2012  smith electric vehicles announced the release of the newton step-van  an all-electric  zero-emission vehicle built on the versatile newton platform that features a walk-in body produced by indiana-based utilimaster  25   an electric car is a plug-in battery powered automobile which is propelled by electric motor s   although electric cars often give good acceleration and have generally acceptable top speed  the lower specific energy of production batteries available in 2015 compared with carbon-based fuels means that electric cars need batteries that are fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give relatively low range between charges  recharging can also take significant lengths of time  for journeys within a single battery charge  rather than long journeys  electric cars are practical forms of transportation and can be recharged overnight   electric cars have the potential of significantly reducing city pollution by having zero tail pipe emissions  29][30][31  vehicle greenhouse gas savings depend on how the electricity is generated  32][33  with the current us energy mix  using an electric car would result in a 30 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions  34][35][36][37  given the current energy mixes in other countries  it has been predicted that such emissions would decrease by 40 percent in the uk  38  19 percent in china  39  and as little as 1 percent in germany  40][41  not in citation given   electric cars are expected to have a major impact in the auto industry 42][43  given advantages in city pollution  less dependence on oil  and expected rise in gasoline prices  44][45][46  world governments are pledging billions to fund development of electric vehicles and their components  the us has pledged us 2.4 billion in federal grants for electric cars and batteries  47  china has announced it will provide us 15 billion to initiate an electric car industry  48   cumulative global sales of highway-capable battery electric cars and vans passed the 1\xa0million unit milestone in september 2016.[3  the renault-nissan alliance is the

two-wheeled electric vehicles is being made for transportation and entertainment  these include devices for sitting on such as electric motorcycles and scooters or electric bicycles  as well as devices for standing on such as the segway pt or self-balancing two-wheeled boards   three-wheeled vehicles include electric rickshaws  a powered variant of the cycle rickshaw   several battery electric ships operate throughout the world  some for business  electric ferries are being operated and constructed  55   electric cars have traditionally used series wound dc motors  a form of brushed dc electric motor  separately excited and permanent magnet are just two of the types of dc motors available  more recent electric vehicles have made use of a variety of ac motor types  as these are simpler to build and have no brushes that can wear out  these are usually induction motors or brushless ac electric motors which use permanent magnets  there are several variations of the permanent magnet motor which offer simpler drive schemes and or lower cost including the brushless dc electric motor   the motor controller regulates the power to the motor  supplying either variable pulse width dc or variable frequency variable amplitude ac  depending on the motor type  dc or ac
