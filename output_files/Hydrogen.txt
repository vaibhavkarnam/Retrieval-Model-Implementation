Hydrogen
 hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol xa0h and atomic number xa01  with a standard atomic weight of circa 7000100800000000000\u26601.008  hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table  its monatomic form  h  is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe  constituting roughly 75  of all baryonic mass  10  note 1  non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state  the most common isotope of hydrogen  termed protium  name rarely used  symbol 1h   has one proton and no neutrons   the universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch  at standard temperature and pressure  hydrogen is a colorless  odorless  tasteless  non-toxic  nonmetallic  highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula h2  since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most nonmetallic elements  most of the hydrogen on earth exists in molecular forms such as water or organic compounds  hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid u2013base reactions because most acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules  in ionic compounds  hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge  i e   anion  when it is known as a hydride  or as a positively charged  i e   cation  species denoted by the symbol h   the hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton  but in reality  hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex  as the only neutral atom for which the schr xf6dinger equation can be solved analytically  11  study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics   hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals  in 1766\u201381  henry cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance  12  and that it produces water when burned  the property for which it was later named  in greek  hydrogen means  water-former    industrial production is mainly from steam reforming natural gas  and less often from more energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water  13  most hydrogen is used near the site of its production  the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing  e g   hydrocracking  and ammonia production  mostly for the fertilizer market  hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals  14  complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks  15       hydrogen gas  dihydrogen or molecular hydrogen  16  is highly flammable and will burn in air at a very wide range of concentrations between 4  and 75  by volume  17  the enthalpy of combustion is \u2212286\xa0kj mol  18   hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air in concentrations from 4\u201374  and with chlorine at 5\u201395   the explosive reactions may be triggered by spark  heat  or sunlight  the hydrogen autoignition temperature  the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air  is 500\xa0\xb0c (932\xa0\xb0f   19  pure hydrogen-oxygen flames emit ultraviolet light and with high oxygen mix are nearly invisible to the naked eye  as illustrated by the faint plume of the space shuttle main engine  compared to the highly visible plume of a space shuttle solid rocket booster  which uses an ammonium perchlorate composite  the detection of a burning hydrogen leak may require a flame detector  such leaks can be very dangerous  hydrogen flames in other conditions are blue  resembling blue natural gas flames  20   the destruction of the hindenburg airship was a notorious example of hydrogen combustion and the cause is still debated  the visible orange flames in that incident were the result of a rich mixture of hydrogen to oxygen combined with carbon compounds from the airship skin   h2 reacts with every oxidizing element  hydrogen can react spontaneously and violently at room temperature with chlorine and fluorine to form the corresponding hydrogen halides  hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride  which are also potentially dangerous acids  21   the ground state energy level of the electron in a hydrogen atom is \u221213.6\xa0ev  22  which is equivalent to an ultraviolet photon of roughly 91\xa0nm wavelength  23   the energy levels of hydrogen can be calculated fairly accurately using the bohr model of the atom  which conceptualizes the electron as  orbiting  the proton in analogy to the earth s orbit of the sun  however  the atomic electron and proton are held together by electromagnetic force  while planets and celestial objects are held by gravity  because of the discretization of angular momentum postulated in early quantum mechanics by bohr  the electron in the bohr model can only occupy certain allowed distances from the proton  and therefore only certain allowed energies  24   a more accurate description of the hydrogen atom comes from a purely quantum mechanical treatment that uses the schr xf6dinger equation  dirac equation or even the feynman path integral formulation to calculate the probability density of the electron around the proton  25  the most complicated treatments allow for the small effects of special relativity and vacuum polarization  in the quantum mechanical treatment  the electron in a ground state hydrogen atom has no angular momentum at all u2014illustrating how the  planetary orbit  differs from electron motion   there exist two different spin isomers of hydrogen diatomic molecules that differ by the relative spin of their nuclei  26  in the orthohydrogen form  the spins of the two protons are parallel and form a triplet state with a molecular spin quantum number of 1 (\u200a1\u20442+\u200a1\u20442   in the parahydrogen form the spins are antiparallel and form a singlet with a molecular spin quantum number of 0 (\u200a1\u20442\u2013\u200a1\u20442   at standard temperature and pressure  hydrogen gas contains about 25  of the para form and 75  of the ortho form  also known as the  normal form   27  the equilibrium ratio of orthohydrogen to parahydrogen depends on temperature  but because the ortho form is an excited state and has a higher energy than the para form  it is unstable and cannot be purified  at very low temperatures  the equilibrium state is composed almost exclusively of the para form  the liquid and gas phase thermal properties of pure parahydrogen differ significantly from those of the normal form because of differences in rotational heat capacities  as discussed more fully in spin isomers of hydrogen  28  the ortho para distinction also occurs in other hydrogen-containing molecules or functional groups  such as water and methylene  but is of little significance for their thermal properties  29   the uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho h2 increases with increasing temperature  thus rapidly condensed h2 contains large quantities of the high-energy ortho form that converts to the para form very slowly  30  the ortho para ratio in condensed h2 is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen  the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate some of the hydrogen liquid  leading to loss of liquefied material  catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion  such as ferric oxide  activated carbon  platinized asbestos  rare earth metals  uranium compounds  chromic oxide  or some nickel 31  compounds  are used during hydrogen cooling  32   while h2 is not very reactive under standard conditions  it does form compounds with most elements  hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative  such as halogens  e g   f  cl  br  i   or oxygen  in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge  33  when bonded to fluorine  oxygen  or nitrogen  hydrogen can participate in a form of medium-strength noncovalent bonding with the hydrogen of other similar molecules  a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding that is critical to the stability of many biological molecules  34][35  hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements  such as metals and metalloids  where it takes on a partial negative charge  these compounds are often known as hydrides  36   hydrogen forms a vast array of compounds with carbon called the hydrocarbons  and an even vaster array with heteroatoms that  because of their general association with living things  are called organic compounds  37  the study of their properties is known as organic chemistry 38  and their study in the context of living organisms is known as biochemistry  39  by some definitions   organic  compounds are only required to contain carbon  however  most of them also contain hydrogen  and because it is the carbon-hydrogen bond which gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics  carbon-hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word  organic  in chemistry  37  millions of hydrocarbons are known  and they are usually formed by complicated synthetic pathways that seldom involve elementary hydrogen   compounds of hydrogen are often called hydrides  a term that is used fairly loosely  the term  hydride  suggests that the h atom has acquired a negative or anionic character  denoted h u2212  and is used when hydrogen forms a compound with a more electropositive element  the existence of the hydride anion  suggested by gilbert n  lewis in 1916 for group 1 and 2 salt-like hydrides  was demonstrated by moers in 1920 by the electrolysis of molten lithium hydride  lih   producing a stoichiometry quantity of hydrogen at the anode  40  for hydrides other than group 1 and 2 metals  the term is quite misleading  considering the low electronegativity of hydrogen  an exception in group 2 hydrides is beh n2  which is polymeric  in lithium aluminium hydride  the alh u2212\n4 anion carries hydridic centers firmly attached to the al iii    although hydrides can be formed with almost all main-group elements  the number and combination of possible compounds varies widely  for example  more than 100 binary borane hydrides are known  but only one binary aluminium hydride  41  binary indium hydride has not yet been identified  although larger complexes exist  42   in inorganic chemistry  hydrides can also serve as bridging ligands that link two metal centers in a coordination complex  this function is particularly common in group 13 elements  especially in boranes  boron hydrides  and aluminium complexes  as well as in clustered carboranes  43   oxidation of hydrogen removes its electron and gives h   which contains no electrons and a nucleus which is usually composed of one proton  that is why h  is often called a proton  this species is central to discussion of acids  under the bronsted-lowry theory  acids are proton donors  while bases are proton acceptors   a bare proton  h   cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons  except at the high temperatures associated with plasmas  such protons cannot be removed from the electron clouds of atoms and molecules  and will remain attached to them  however  the term  proton  is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or cationic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion  and as such is denoted  h   without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species   to avoid the implication of the naked  solvated proton  in solution  acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species  termed the  hydronium ion  (h n3o    however  even in this case  such solvated hydrogen cations are more realistically conceived as being organized into clusters that form species closer to h n9o  n4.[44  other oxonium ions are found when water is in acidic solution with other solvents  45   although exotic on earth  one of the most common ions in the universe is the h  n3 ion  known as protonated molecular hydrogen or the trihydrogen cation  46   hydrogen has three naturally occurring isotopes  denoted 1h  2h and 3h  other  highly unstable nuclei (4h to 7h  have been synthesized in the laboratory but not observed in nature  47][48   hydrogen is the only element that has different names for its isotopes in common use today  during the early study of radioactivity  various heavy radioactive isotopes were given their own names  but such names are no longer used  except for deuterium and tritium  the symbols d and t  instead of 2h and 3h  are sometimes used for deuterium and tritium  but the corresponding symbol for protium  p  is already in use for phosphorus and thus is not available for protium  58  in its nomenclatural guidelines  the international union of pure and applied chemistry allows any of d  t  2h  and 3h to be used  although 2h and 3h are preferred  59   the exotic atom muonium  symbol mu   composed of an antimuon and an electron  is also sometimes considered as a light radioisotope of hydrogen  due to the mass difference between the antimuon and the electron  60  which was discovered in 1960[61  during the muon s 7000220000000000000\u26602.2\xa0\xb5s lifetime  muonium can enter into compounds such as muonium chloride  mucl  or sodium muonide  namu   analogous to hydrogen chloride and sodium hydride respectively  62   in 1671  robert boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids  which results in the production of hydrogen gas  63][64  in 1766  henry cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance  by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction  inflammable air   he speculated that  inflammable air  was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called "phlogiston  65][66  and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned  he is usually given credit for the discovery of hydrogen as an element  7][8  in 1783  antoine lavoisier gave the element the name hydrogen  from the greek \u1f51\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf- hydro meaning  water  and - u03b3\u03b5\u03bd u03ae u03c2 genes meaning "creator   9  when he and laplace reproduced cavendish s finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned  8   lavoisier produced hydrogen for his experiments on mass conservation by reacting a flux of steam with metallic iron through an incandescent iron tube heated in a fire  anaerobic oxidation of iron by the protons of water at high temperature can be schematically represented by the set of following reactions   many metals such as zirconium undergo a similar reaction with water leading to the production of hydrogen   hydrogen was liquefied for the first time by james dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention  the vacuum flask  8  he produced solid hydrogen the next year  8  deuterium was discovered in december 1931 by harold urey  and tritium was prepared in 1934 by ernest rutherford  mark oliphant  and paul harteck  7  heavy water  which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen  was discovered by urey s group in 1932.[8  fran xe7ois isaac de rivaz built the first de rivaz engine  an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806  edward daniel clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819  the d xf6bereiner s lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.[8   the first hydrogen-filled balloon was invented by jacques charles in 1783.[8  hydrogen provided the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by henri giffard  8  german count ferdinand von zeppelin promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called zeppelins  the first of which had its maiden flight in 1900.[8  regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of world war i in august 1914  they had carried 35,000 passengers without a serious incident  hydrogen-lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war   the first non-stop transatlantic crossing was made by the british airship r34 in 1919  regular passenger service resumed in the 1920s and the discovery of helium reserves in the united states promised increased safety  but the u s  government refused to sell the gas for this purpose  therefore  h2 was used in the hindenburg airship  which was destroyed in a midair fire over new jersey on 6 may 1937.[8  the incident was broadcast live on radio and filmed  ignition of leaking hydrogen is widely assumed to be the cause  but later investigations pointed to the ignition of the aluminized fabric coating by static electricity  but the damage to hydrogen s reputation as a lifting gas was already done   in the same year the first hydrogen-cooled turbogenerator went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a coolant in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at dayton  ohio  by the dayton power  amp  light co   67  because of the thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas  this is the most common type in its field today   the nickel hydrogen battery was used for the first time in 1977 aboard the u s  navy s navigation technology satellite-2 (nts-2).[68  for example  the iss  69  mars odyssey 70  and the mars global surveyor 71  are equipped with nickel-hydrogen batteries  in the dark part of its orbit  the hubble space telescope is also powered by nickel-hydrogen batteries  which were finally replaced in may 2009,[72  more than 19 years after launch and 13 years beyond their design life  73   because of its simple atomic structure  consisting only of a proton and an electron  the hydrogen atom  together with the spectrum of light produced from it or absorbed by it  has been central to the development of the theory of atomic structure  74  furthermore  study of the corresponding simplicity of the hydrogen molecule and the corresponding cation h  n2 brought understanding of the nature of the chemical bond  which followed shortly after the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom had been developed in the mid-1920s   one of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed  but not understood at the time  was a maxwell observation involving hydrogen  half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived  maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of h2 unaccountably departs from that of a diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures  according to quantum theory  this behavior arises from the spacing of the  quantized  rotational energy levels  which are particularly wide-spaced in h2 because of its low mass  these widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures  diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect  75   antihydrogen  h  is the antimatter counterpart to hydrogen  it consists of an antiproton with a positron  antihydrogen is the only type of antimatter atom to have been produced as of 2015.[76][77   hydrogen  as atomic h  is the most abundant chemical element in the universe  making up 75  of normal matter by mass and more than 90  by number of atoms   most of the mass of the universe  however  is not in the form of chemical-element type matter  but rather is postulated to occur as yet-undetected forms of mass such as dark matter and dark energy  78   this element is found in great abundance in stars and gas giant planets  molecular clouds of h2 are associated with star formation  hydrogen plays a vital role in powering stars through the proton-proton reaction and the cno cycle nuclear fusion  79   throughout the universe  hydrogen is mostly found in the atomic and plasma states  with properties quite different from those of molecular hydrogen  as a plasma  hydrogen s electron and proton are not bound together  resulting in very high electrical conductivity and high emissivity  producing the light from the sun and other stars   the charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields  for example  in the solar wind they interact with the earth s magnetosphere giving rise to birkeland currents and the aurora  hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the interstellar medium  the large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped lyman-alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the universe up to redshift z 4.[80   under ordinary conditions on earth  elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas  h2  however  hydrogen gas is very rare in the earth s atmosphere (1 ppm by volume  because of its light weight  which enables it to escape from earth s gravity more easily than heavier gases  however  hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the earth s surface  81  mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water  43  hydrogen gas is produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural component of flatus  as is methane  itself a hydrogen source of increasing importance  82   a molecular form called protonated molecular hydrogen (h  n3  is found in the interstellar medium  where it is generated by ionization of molecular hydrogen from cosmic rays  this charged ion has also been observed in the upper atmosphere of the planet jupiter  the ion is relatively stable in the environment of outer space due to the low temperature and density  h  n3 is one of the most abundant ions in the universe  and it plays a notable role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium  83  neutral triatomic hydrogen h3 can exist only in an excited form and is unstable  84  by contrast  the positive hydrogen molecular ion (h  n2  is a rare molecule in the universe   h n2 is produced in chemistry and biology laboratories  often as a by-product of other reactions  in industry for the hydrogenation of unsaturated substrates  and in nature as a means of expelling reducing equivalents in biochemical reactions   hydrogen can be prepared in several different ways  but economically the most important processes involve removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons  as about 95  of hydrogen production came from steam reforming around year 2000.[85  commercial bulk hydrogen is usually produced by the steam reforming of natural gas  86  at high temperatures (1000\u20131400\xa0k  700\u20131100\xa0\xb0c or 1300\u20132000\xa0\xb0f   steam  water vapor  reacts with methane to yield carbon monoxide and h n2   this reaction is favored at low pressures but is nonetheless conducted at high pressures (2.0 \xa0mpa  20\xa0atm or 600\xa0inhg   this is because high-pressure h n2 is the most marketable product and pressure swing adsorption  psa  purification systems work better at higher pressures  the product mixture is known as  synthesis gas  because it is often used directly for the production of methanol and related compounds  hydrocarbons other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios  one of the many complications to this highly optimized technology is the formation of coke or carbon   consequently  steam reforming typically employs an excess of h n2o  additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon monoxide through the water gas shift reaction  especially with an iron oxide catalyst  this reaction is also a common industrial source of carbon dioxide  86   other important methods for h n2 production include partial oxidation of hydrocarbons  87   and the coal reaction  which can serve as a prelude to the shift reaction above  86   hydrogen is sometimes produced and consumed in the same industrial process  without being separated  in the haber process for the production of ammonia  hydrogen is generated from natural gas  88  electrolysis of brine to yield chlorine also produces hydrogen as a co-product  89   in the laboratory  h n2 is usually prepared by the reaction of dilute non-oxidizing acids on some reactive metals such as zinc with kipp s apparatus   aluminium can also produce h n2 upon treatment with bases   the electrolysis of water is a simple method of producing hydrogen  a low voltage current is run through the water  and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode  typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage  if  however  the gas is to be burnt on site  oxygen is desirable to assist the combustion  and so both electrodes would be made from inert metals   iron  for instance  would oxidize  and thus decrease the amount of oxygen given off   the theoretical maximum efficiency  electricity used vs  energetic value of hydrogen produced  is in the range 80\u201394%.[90   an alloy of aluminium and gallium in pellet form added to water can be used to generate hydrogen  the process also produces alumina  but the expensive gallium  which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets  can be re-used  this has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy  as hydrogen can be produced on-site and does not need to be transported  91   there are more than 200 thermochemical cycles which can be used for water splitting  around a dozen of these cycles such as the iron oxide cycle  cerium iv  oxide u2013cerium iii  oxide cycle  zinc zinc-oxide cycle  sulfur-iodine cycle  copper-chlorine cycle and hybrid sulfur cycle are under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity  92  a number of laboratories  including in france  germany  greece  japan  and the usa  are developing thermochemical methods to produce hydrogen from solar energy and water  93   under anaerobic conditions  iron and steel alloys are slowly oxidized by the protons of water concomitantly reduced in molecular hydrogen (h n2   the anaerobic corrosion of iron leads first to the formation of ferrous hydroxide  green rust  and can be described by the following reaction   in its turn  under anaerobic conditions  the ferrous hydroxide (fe oh  n2   can be oxidized by the protons of water to form magnetite and molecular hydrogen  this process is described by the schikorr reaction   the well crystallized magnetite (fe n3o n4  is thermodynamically more stable than the ferrous hydroxide (fe oh  n2     this process occurs during the anaerobic corrosion of iron and steel in oxygen-free groundwater and in reducing soils below the water table   in the absence of atmospheric oxygen (o n2   in deep geological conditions prevailing far away from earth atmosphere  hydrogen (h n2  is produced during the process of serpentinization by the anaerobic oxidation by the water protons  h   of the ferrous (fe2   silicate present in the crystal lattice of the fayalite (fe n2sio n4  the olivine iron-endmember   the corresponding reaction leading to the formation of magnetite (fe n3o n4   quartz (sio n2  and hydrogen (h n2  is the following   this reaction closely resembles the schikorr reaction observed in the anaerobic oxidation of the ferrous hydroxide in contact with water   from all the fault gases formed in power transformers  hydrogen is the most common and is generated under most fault conditions  thus  formation of hydrogen is an early indication of serious problems in the transformer s life cycle  94   large quantities of h n2 are needed in the petroleum and chemical industries  the largest application of h n2 is for the processing   upgrading   of fossil fuels  and in the production of ammonia  the key consumers of h n2 in the petrochemical plant include hydrodealkylation  hydrodesulfurization  and hydrocracking  h n2 has several other important uses  h n2 is used as a hydrogenating agent  particularly in increasing the level of saturation of unsaturated fats and oils  found in items such as margarine   and in the production of methanol  it is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid  h n2 is also used as a reducing agent of metallic ores  95   hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals 96  and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals  97  hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice  98  these properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks  but the gas s high solubility is a metallurgical problem  contributing to the embrittlement of many metals  14  complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks  15   apart from its use as a reactant  h n2 has wide applications in physics and engineering  it is used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding  99][100  h2 is used as the rotor coolant in electrical generators at power stations  because it has the highest thermal conductivity of any gas  liquid h2 is used in cryogenic research  including superconductivity studies  101  because h n2 is lighter than air  having a little more than \u200a1\u204414 of the density of air  it was once widely used as a lifting gas in balloons and airships  102   in more recent applications  hydrogen is used pure or mixed with nitrogen  sometimes called forming gas  as a tracer gas for minute leak detection  applications can be found in the automotive  chemical  power generation  aerospace  and telecommunications industries  103  hydrogen is an authorized food additive  e 949  that allows food package leak testing among other anti-oxidizing properties  104   hydrogen s rarer isotopes also each have specific applications  deuterium (hydrogen-2  is used in nuclear fission applications as a moderator to slow neutrons  and in nuclear fusion reactions  8  deuterium compounds have applications in chemistry and biology in studies of reaction isotope effects  105  tritium (hydrogen-3   produced in nuclear reactors  is used in the production of hydrogen bombs  106  as an isotopic label in the biosciences  57  and as a radiation source in luminous paints  107   the triple point temperature of equilibrium hydrogen is a defining fixed point on the its-90 temperature scale at 13.8033\xa0kelvins  108   hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators due to a number of favorable properties that are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules  these include low density  low viscosity  and the highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all gases   hydrogen is not an energy resource  109  except in the hypothetical context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium  a technology presently far from development  110  the sun s energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen  but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on earth  111  elemental hydrogen from solar  biological  or electrical sources require more energy to make it than is obtained by burning it  so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier  like a battery  hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources  such as methane   but these sources are unsustainable  109   the energy density per unit volume of both liquid hydrogen and compressed hydrogen gas at any practicable pressure is significantly less than that of traditional fuel sources  although the energy density per unit fuel mass is higher  109  nevertheless  elemental hydrogen has been widely discussed in the context of energy  as a possible future carrier of energy on an economy-wide scale  112  for example  co n2 sequestration followed by carbon capture and storage could be conducted at the point of h n2 production from fossil fuels  113  hydrogen used in transportation would burn relatively cleanly  with some nox emissions  114  but without carbon emissions  113  however  the infrastructure costs associated with full conversion to a hydrogen economy would be substantial  115  fuel cells can convert hydrogen and oxygen directly to electricity more efficiently than internal combustion engines  116   hydrogen is employed to saturate broken   dangling   bonds of amorphous silicon and amorphous carbon that helps stabilizing material properties  117  it is also a potential electron donor in various oxide materials  including zno  118][119  sno2  cdo  mgo  120  zro2  hfo2  la2o3  y2o3  tio2  srtio3  laalo3  sio2  al2o3  zrsio4  hfsio4  and srzro3.[121   h2 is a product of some types of anaerobic metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms  usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases  these enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between h2 and its component two protons and two electrons  creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water  122  the natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle  123   water splitting  in which water is decomposed into its component protons  electrons  and oxygen  occurs in the light reactions in all photosynthetic organisms  some such organisms  including the alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii and cyanobacteria  have evolved a second step in the dark reactions in which protons and electrons are reduced to form h2 gas by specialized hydrogenases in the chloroplast  124  efforts have been undertaken to genetically modify cyanobacterial hydrogenases to efficiently synthesize h2 gas even in the presence of oxygen  125  efforts have also been undertaken with genetically modified alga in a bioreactor  126   hydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety  from potential detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure  oxygen-free form  127  in addition  liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers  such as frostbite  associated with very cold liquids  128  hydrogen dissolves in many metals  and  in addition to leaking out  may have adverse effects on them  such as hydrogen embrittlement  129  leading to cracks and explosions  130  hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite  moreover  hydrogen fire  while being extremely hot  is almost invisible  and thus can lead to accidental burns  131   even interpreting the hydrogen data  including safety data  is confounded by a number of phenomena  many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen orthohydrogen ratio  it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio  for which the data is usually given   hydrogen detonation parameters  such as critical detonation pressure and temperature  strongly depend on the container geometry  127
