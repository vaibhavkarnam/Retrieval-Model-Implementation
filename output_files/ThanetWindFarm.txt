ThanetWindFarm
 the thanet wind farm  also sometimes called thanet offshore wind farm  2  is an offshore wind farm 7 miles (11\xa0km  off the coast of thanet district in kent  england  it is the world s third largest offshore wind farm  as of june 2013 update   the largest being the london array  followed by walney wind farm  3][4  it has a nameplate capacity  maximum output  of 300\xa0mw and it cost \xa3780[5]\u2013900\xa0million 6  (us 1.2\u20131.4\xa0billion   thanet is one of fifteen round xa02 wind projects announced by the crown estate in january 2004 but the first to be developed  it was officially opened on 23\xa0september 2010,[3][7  when it overtook horns rev 2 as the biggest offshore wind farm in the world  it has since been overtaken by walney  4       the project covers an area of 13.5 square miles (35\xa0km2   with 500 metres (1,600\xa0ft  between turbines and 800 metres (2,600\xa0ft  between the rows  average water depth is 14\u201323 metres (46\u201375\xa0ft   6  planning permission for the project was granted on 18\xa0december 2006.[8  according to thanet offshore wind ltd  it was expected to be  the largest operational offshore wind farm in the world   9  the thanet project has a total capacity of 300\xa0mw which  by yearly average  is sufficient to supply approximately 240,000 homes  2  it has an estimated generation of 960\xa0gw xb7h per year 10  of electricity  i e  a projected capacity factor of 36.5  and an average power density of 3.1 w m xb2  nin 2012  the yearly production achieved was 821.68\xa0gw xb7h  i e  a capacity factor of 31.3%.[1   two submarine power cables  by italy-based prysmian group  run from an offshore substation within the wind farm connecting to an existing onshore substation in richborough  kent  connecting to a world-first two transformers  11  the offshore substation steps up the turbine voltage of 33\xa0kv to 132\xa0kv for the grid  12  maintenance of the turbines is carried out by vestas  while a separate maintenance agreement with slp energy covers the turbines foundations  turbines are installed by the danish offshore wind farm services provider a2sea  the tiv mpi resolution carried and installed the turbines  13   the thanet scheme is project financed  thanet offshore wind ltd  tow   the project company was owned by hedge fund christofferson  robb  amp  co  it was purchased from a group of sponsors led by warwick energy ltd  14][15  in august 2008 christofferson  robb  amp  co placed the project back on the market  16  on 10\xa0november 2008  vattenfall  a swedish energy company  acquired tow  17   the development was due to be in place by 2008  vestas were chosen as the preferred turbine supplier in july 2006  and slp were chosen as preferred supplier for the foundations in september 2006  the project was delayed by a number of issues including problems with vestas who temporarily withdrew their v90 offshore model from the market in 2007 following gearbox problems  the v90-3mw was re-released for sales starting from may 2008.[18   vattenfall acquired the project in november 2008  on 28 june 2010  they reported that all turbines had been installed 19  for commissioning due by the end of 2010.[20  the wind farm was completed in september 2010.[21][22][23   since turbine construction makes up the majority of the project cost and the uk has no capacity  much of the work was contracted to foreign companies  resulting in only 20  of the investment going to british firms  24  there have been calls for the creation of a domestic wind industry  25   an article by climate change sceptic and intelligent design supporter [26  christopher booker estimates that due to the wind being intermittent  thanet wind farm will only produce 75mw on average  the owners will receive a subsidy of \xa360m per year on top of the \xa330\u201340m cost of the electricity due to renewables obligation certificates  and based on the estimated working life of the turbines of 20 years  the total subsidy will come to \xa31.2 billion  since there are only 21 permanent green jobs  the subsidy per job comes to around \xa33m per year  27  however  booker used a generic capacity of 25   lower than vattenfall s estimate for thanet of 35\u201340  capacity (105\u2013120 mw   5  the working life figure is also lower than other estimates of 40 years  11   in june 2010  the crown estate announced that thanet wind farm could be extended to produce an additional 147 mw  28  however  in october 2010  vattenfall stated that it would not proceed  29
