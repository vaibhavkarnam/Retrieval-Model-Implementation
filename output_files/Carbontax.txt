Carbontax
 a carbon tax is a tax levied on the carbon content of fuels  1  it is a form of carbon pricing  carbon is present in every hydrocarbon fuel  coal  petroleum  and natural gas  and converted to carbon dioxide (co n2  and other products when combusted  in contrast  non-combustion energy sources u2014wind  sunlight  geothermal  hydropower  and nuclear u2014do not convert hydrocarbons to co n2  co n2 is a heat-trapping  greenhouse  gas 2  which represents a negative externality on the climate system  see scientific opinion on global warming   2][3][4  since ghg emissions caused by the combustion of fossil fuels are closely related to the carbon content of the respective fuels  a tax on these emissions can be levied by taxing the carbon content of fossil fuels at any point in the product cycle of the fuel  5   carbon tax offers social and economic benefits  it is a tax that increases revenue without significantly altering the economy while simultaneously promoting objectives of climate change policy  the objective of a carbon tax is to reduce the harmful and unfavorable levels of carbon dioxide emissions  thereby decelerating climate change and its negative effects on the environment and human health  6   carbon taxes offer a potentially cost-effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions  7  from an economic perspective  carbon taxes are a type of pigovian tax  8  they help to address the problem of emitters of greenhouse gases not facing the full social cost of their actions  carbon taxes can be a regressive tax  in that they may directly or indirectly affect low-income groups disproportionately  the regressive impact of carbon taxes could be addressed by using tax revenues to favour low-income groups  9   a number of countries have implemented carbon taxes or energy taxes that are related to carbon content  10  most environmentally related taxes with implications for greenhouse gas emissions in oecd countries are levied on energy products and motor vehicles  rather than on co n2 emissions directly  7   opposition to increased environmental regulation such as carbon taxes often centers on concerns that firms might relocate and or people might lose their jobs  10  it has been argued  however  that carbon taxes are more efficient than direct regulation and may even lead to higher employment  see footnotes   10  many large users of carbon resources in electricity generation  such as the united states  russia  and china  are resisting carbon taxation       carbon dioxide is one of several heat-trapping greenhouse gases  ghgs  emitted by humans  anthropogenic ghgs   2]:6[11][12  the scientific consensus is that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause of global warming  13  and that carbon dioxide is the most important of the anthropogenic ghgs  14][15][16  worldwide  27 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide are produced by human activity annually  17  the physical effect of co2 in the atmosphere can be measured as a change in the earth-atmosphere system s energy balance \u2013 the radiative forcing of co2.[18  carbon taxes are one of the policies available to governments to reduce ghg emissions  19   in the kyoto protocol  an international treaty   co2 emissions are regulated along with other ghgs  different ghgs have different physical properties  the global warming potential is an internationally accepted scale of equivalence for other greenhouse gases in units of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent   a carbon tax is a form of pollution tax  21  pollution taxes are often grouped with two other economic policy instruments  tradable pollution permits credits and subsidies  these three environmental economic policy instruments are built upon a foundation of a command and control regulation  the difference is that classic command-penalty regulations stipulate  through performance or prescriptive standards  what each polluter is required to do to be in compliance with the law  command and control regulation is not considered an economic instrument as it is typically enforced by narrower means such as stop or control order  though it may include an administrative monetary penalty in site-specific regulations  22  the instrumental distinction between a tax and a command-and-control regulation is determined by the enacted legislative names  and whether they contain  tax  as a defined term within the act  for example british columbia s carbon tax act versus alberta s specified gas emitters regulation  alta reg 139/2007  a carbon tax is also an indirect tax u2014a tax on a transaction u2014as opposed to a direct tax  which taxes income  a carbon tax is called a price instrument  since it sets a price for carbon dioxide emissions  23  in economic theory  pollution is considered a negative externality  a negative effect on a party not directly involved in a transaction  which results in a market failure  to confront parties with the issue  the economist arthur pigou proposed taxing the goods  in this case hydrocarbon fuels   which were the source of the negative externality  carbon dioxide  so as to accurately reflect the cost of the goods  production to society  thereby internalizing the costs associated with the goods  production  a tax on a negative externality is called a pigovian tax  and should equal the marginal damage costs   within pigou s framework  the changes involved are marginal  and the size of the externality is assumed to be small enough not to distort the rest of the economy  24  according to the scientific consensus  the impact of climate change may result in catastrophe and non-marginal changes  25][26   non-marginal  means that the impact could significantly reduce the growth rate in income and welfare  the amount of resources that should be devoted to avoiding climate change impacts is controversial  25  policies designed to reduce carbon emissions could also have a non-marginal impact  27   prices of hydrocarbon fuels are expected to continue increasing as more countries industrialize and add to the demand on fuel supplies  28  in addition to creating incentives for energy conservation  a carbon tax would put renewable energy sources such as wind  solar and geothermal on a more competitive footing  stimulating their growth  david gordon wilson first proposed a carbon tax in 1973.[29   the social cost of carbon  scc  is the marginal cost of the impacts caused by emitting one extra tonne of carbon  as carbon dioxide  at any point in time  inclusive of \u2018non-market u2019 impacts on the environment and human health  30  to calculate the scc  the atmospheric residence time of carbon dioxide must be estimated  along with an estimate of the impacts of climate change  the impact of the extra tonne of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere must then be converted to the equivalent impacts when the tonne of carbon dioxide was emitted  in economics  comparing impacts over time requires a discount rate  this rate determines the weight placed on impacts occurring at different times   according to economic theory  if scc estimates were complete and markets perfect  a carbon tax should be set equal to the scc  emission permits would also have a value equal to the scc  in reality  however  markets are not perfect  and scc estimates are not complete  yohe et al    2007:823).[31   an amount of co2 pollution is measured by the weight  mass  of the pollution  sometimes this is measured directly as the weight of the carbon dioxide molecules  this is called a tonne of carbon dioxide and is abbreviated "tco2   alternatively  the pollution s weight can be measured by adding up only the weight of the carbon atoms in the pollution  ignoring the oxygen atoms  this is called a tonne of carbon and is abbreviated  tc   estimates of the dollar cost of carbon dioxide pollution is given per tonne  either carbon   x tc  or carbon dioxide  $x tco2  one tc is roughly equivalent to 3.7 tco2.[32   estimates of the scc are highly uncertain  33  yohe et al  (2007:813  summarized the literature on scc estimates  peer-reviewed estimates of the scc for 2005 had an average value of $43 tc ($12/tco2  with a standard deviation of $83/tc  34  the wide range of estimates is explained mostly by underlying uncertainties in the science of climate change  e g   the climate sensitivity  which is a measure of the amount of global warming expected for a doubling in the atmospheric concentration of co n2   different choices of discount rate  different valuations of economic and non-economic impacts  treatment of equity  and how potential catastrophic impacts are estimated  34  other estimates of the scc spanned at least three orders of magnitude  from less than $1 tc to over $1,500/tc  34  the true scc is expected to increase over time  34  the rate of increase will very likely be 2 to 4  per year  34  a recent meta-analysis of the literature on the estimates of the social costs of carbon  however  finds evidence of publication bias in favor of larger estimates  35   the us federal government  based on executive order 12866 and the findings of an interagency working group  has had an official estimate of the scc since 2010  it was $36/tc02 in 2015  about $132/tc   36  in 2014  the department of energy factored in that cost when promulgating regulations on standards for commercial refrigeration equipment  industry groups sued over the issue  in 2016 the 7th u s  circuit court of appeals upheld the rules  37][38   carbon leakage is the effect that regulation of emissions in one country sector has on the emissions in other countries sectors that are not subject to the same regulation  39  leakage effects can be both negative  i e   increasing the effectiveness of reducing overall emissions  and positive  reducing the effectiveness of reducing overall emissions   40  negative leakages  which are desirable  are usually referred to as "spill-over   41   according to goldemberg et al   (1996  p  xa028   short-term leakage effects need to be judged against leakage effects in the long-term  42  a policy that  for example  saw a carbon taxes set only in developed countries might lead to leakage of emissions to developing countries  however  a desirable negative leakage could occur due to a lowering in demands of coal  oil  and gas from the developed countries and thus the world prices  this will lead to developing countries being able to afford more of any hydrocarbon fuel type  thus being able to substitute more oil or gas for coal  in effect lowering their national emissions  in the long-run  however  if the transfer of less polluting technologies is delayed  this substitution by income effects might have no long-term benefit   carbon leakage is central to the discussion on climate policy  given the confluence of issues that are currently being debated  including the 2030 energy and climate framework and the review of the eu carbon leakage list by 2014.[43   a number of policies have been suggested to address concerns over competitive losses due to one country introducing a carbon tax while another country does not  44][45  similar policies have also been suggested in an attempt to induce countries to introduce carbon taxes  suggested policies include border tax adjustments  trade tariffs  trade bans and deaths   border tax adjustments would account for emissions attributable to imports from nations without a carbon price  an alternative would be trade bans or tariffs applied to non-taxing countries  it has been argued that such approaches could be disadvantageous to a target country as a trade measure  gupta et al    2007).[7  to date  world trade organization case law has not provided specific rulings on climate-related taxes  the administrative aspects of border tax adjustments has also been discussed  46   two other types of taxes that are related to carbon taxes are emissions taxes and energy taxes  an emissions tax on ghg emissions requires individual emitters to pay a fee  charge or tax for every tonne of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere 7  while an energy tax is charged directly on the energy commodities   in terms of mitigating climate change  a carbon tax  which is levied according to the carbon content of fuels  is not a perfect substitute for a tax on co2 emissions  47  for example  a carbon tax encourages reduced use of hydrocarbon fuels  but it does not provide an incentive to mitigate or improve mitigation technologies  e g  carbon capture and storage   energy taxes increase the price of energy uniformly  regardless of the emissions produced by the energy source  fisher et al    1996  p  xa0416   an ad valorem energy tax is levied according to the energy content of a fuel or the value of an energy product  which may or may not be consistent with the emitted amounts of green house gases and their respective global warming potentials  studies indicate that to reduce emissions by a certain amount  ad valorem energy taxes would be more costly than carbon taxes  19  however  although co2 emissions are an externality  using energy services may result in other negative externalities  e g   air pollution  if these other externalities are accounted for  an energy tax may be more efficient than a carbon tax alone   another type of tax is a fee and dividend  where the money collected from the tax is returned equitably to all households  effectively taxing carbon emitters and rebating those that burn less carbon   many oecd countries have taxed fuel directly for many years for some applications  for example  the uk imposes duty directly on vehicle hydrocarbon oils  including petrol and diesel fuel  the duty is adjusted to ensure that the carbon content of different fuels is handled with equivalence  48   while a direct tax should send a clear signal to the consumer  its use as an efficient mechanism to influence consumers  fuel use has been challenged in some areas  49   some also note that a suitably priced tax on vehicle fuel may also counterbalance the  rebound effect  that has been observed when vehicle fuel consumption has improved through the imposition of efficiency standards  rather than reduce their overall consumption of fuel  consumers have been seen to make additional journeys or purchase heavier and more powerful vehicles  50   a carbon tax that compensates for the scc varies by fuel source  the carbon dioxide production of the fuel source per unit mass or volume is multiplied by the scc to obtain the tax  based on the mean peer reviewed value ($43 tc or $12/tco2  see social cost of carbon  above   the table below estimates the tax   note that the tax per kwh of electricity depends on the thermal efficiency of the generating power plant  which varies from power plant to power plant  the table follows the american physical society  aps  estimate of 10.3 btu wh (33%).[53  the aps notes that  it is expected that future plants  especially those based on gas turbine systems  often will have higher efficiencies  in some cases exceeding 50    a theoretical conversion rate of 100  is 3.412 btu wh  a more practical limit for thermal power plants is carnot s theorem   both energy and carbon taxes have been implemented in responses to commitments under the united nations framework convention on climate change  19  in most cases where an energy or carbon tax is implemented  the tax is implemented in combination with various forms of exemptions   carbon tax is payable in foreign currency at the rate of us 0.03 (3 cents  per litre of petroleum and diesel products or 5  of cost  insurance and freight value  as defined in the customs and excise act  chapter 23:02    whichever is greater   54   a tax on emissions has been proposed for south africa  announced by finance minister pravin gordhan  the tax will be implemented starting september 1  2015 on new motor vehicles  55  this tax will apply at the time of sale  and will be related to the amount of co2 emitted by the vehicle  75 south african rand will be added to the price for every gram of co2 per kilometer the vehicle emits over 120 g km  the tax will apply to passenger cars first and eventually to commercial vehicles  56  bakkies  pickup trucks  will be taxed because they are often used as passenger vehicles  this has caused an uproar for fear of affecting industry   david powels of the national association of automobile manufacturers of south africa  naamsa   opposes this taxation on light commercial vehicles  55  the tax could increase the cost of new vehicles by 2.5  and cause a decrease in total automobile sales  in addition  powels questions the ability to accurately predict co2 emissions based on engine capacity  57  naamsa acknowledges the ability of carbon taxes to change consumer behavior for the betterment of the environment  but argues that this tax is not transparent enough for consumers because the taxation occurs at the time of automobile production  57  powels says the tax is discriminatory because it targets new vehicles  and that the government should focus on introducing  green fuel  to south africa  57   the goal of the carbon tax is to put south africa on a  sustainable path   58  south africa has produced long term mitigation scenarios  ltms  to address climate policy issues that consider variables such as technology  investment  and policy  including carbon taxes  and to clarify south africa s position for potential unfcc negotiations  58   the chinese government ministry of finance has proposed to introduce a carbon tax from 2012 or 2013  based on carbon dioxide output from hydrocarbon fuel sources such as oil and coal  59][60  the introduction of a carbon tax in china might affect severely the internal market  as well as many other laws and regulations of the country  but given the size of chinese economy also contribute importantly to the mitigation of climate change  61   on july 1  2010 india introduced a nationwide carbon tax of 50 rupees per tonne ($1.07 t  of coal both produced and imported into india  in a budget speech on 2014  the finance minister increased the price to 100 rupees per tonne   $1.60 t at $60.5 conversion  62  in india coal is used to power more than half of the country s electricity generation  63   india s total coal production is estimated to reach 571.87 million tons in the year ending march 2010 and is expected to import around 100 million tons  the carbon tax expects to raise 25 billion rupees ($535 million  for the financial year 2010\u20132011  according to then finance minister pranab mukherjee  the clean energy tax will help to finance a national clean energy fund (ncef   63  industry bodies have not favored the levy and fear that the resultant higher price of coal could trigger inflation  62   while many remain apprehensive  a carbon tax is a step towards helping india meet their voluntary target to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released per unit of gross domestic product by 25  from 2005 levels by 2020  environment minister jairam ramesh told reporters in june 2010 that a domestic tax should come before a global carbon tax  and india has imposed one while others debate the issue  with the new government in india under pm narendra modi  the carbon tax has been further increased form 100rs per tonne to 200rs per tonne in the budget 2015-16.[63][64  currently the carbon tax stands at 400rs per tonne   in october 2012 japan introduced a carbon tax with the goal to take action on mitigating dangerous climate change  the government plans to use the revenues generated from this tax to finance clean energy and energy saving projects  65   in december 2009  nine industry groupings opposed a carbon tax at the opening day of the cop-15 copenhagen climate conference stating   japan should not consider a carbon tax as it would damage the economy which is already among the world s most energy efficient   the industry groupings represented the oil  cement  paper  chemical  gas  electric power  auto manufacturing and electronics  and information technology sectors  the sectors state that  the government has neither studied nor explained thoroughly enough why such a carbon tax is needed  how effective and fair it is and how the payments are to be used   66   in 2005  an environmental tax proposed by japanese authorities was also delayed due to major opposition from the petroleum association of japan  paj   other industries and consumers  the delay was  to avoid putting too much economic burden on end-users as they were already paying heavy taxes on hydrocarbon fuels amid high oil prices   the tax that was to be implemented would be 2,400 yen ($20.85 in 2005 dollars  per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted from fuels  tax on coal would be about 1.58 yen per kilogram and that on gasoline 1.52 yen per litre (4.3 cents per gallon in 2005 dollars   officials estimated that the tax would generate income of 37 billion yen a year for the government and result in a payment of 2,100 yen per year for an average household  67   on august 22  2008 the chong wa dae  also known as the blue house \u2013 the executive office and official residence of the south korean head of state  confirmed a list of 40 new administrative strategy agenda  which included substitution of a carbon tax with the current transportation tax  68  most revenues of the tax amounting to an annual $11 trillion won ($10.4 billion  will be financed toward the  low carbon  green growth  move  which was announced in president lee myung-bak s speech marking the nation s 63rd liberation day the week before the announcement  68  a carbon tax is imposed on emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide  the direct taxation system is now applied to several european countries  such as sweden  the netherlands and norway  as well as several states in north america  the temporary transportation tax  one of the major objective taxes in the country  is slated to end in 2009  about 80 percent of its yield is used in transportation-related work like road construction  additional taxation amendment could follow with a  tax on emissions  bottom line  in possible implementations of tax discrimination according to a vehicles  size and a carbon tax on the currently tax-free thermal power plants  taxation on emissions is inevitable in that low carbon policies take substantial budget  the government says  68   in february 2010  a deputy finance minister yoon young-sun confirmed that south korea is considering a carbon tax to help reduce emissions 4  from 2005 levels by 2020.[69  this would be in conjunction with a cap-and-trade program to be implemented later this year  with a tax rate of 31,828 won (25 euros  per ton of co2  the south korean government would collect 9.1 trillion won ($7.9 billion  in tax revenue based on 2007 emissions  income from the carbon tax would be used to reduce corporate and income taxes  on july 22  2010 chairman sohn kyung-shik of the korea chamber of commerce and industry asked for the south korean government to delay the implementation of the carbon tax   if the government applies much stricter guidelines over carbon emissions  then companies might be burdened   70   on july 13  2010 south korea s government announced plans to more than double its financing for green research and development projects to 3.5 trillion won ($2.9/\xa31.9bn  by 2013  the finance ministry decided that the new investment will be put into a new dedicated green fund operated by the state-run korea finance corporation  for distribution to private sector projects  the government said that the fund forms part of a huge low-carbon investment drive that will see it invest a total of 107.4 trillion won  or two percent of the country s annual gross domestic product  on green projects between 2009 and 2013.[71   however  the government signaled that in addition to setting aside state funds  it will ask private companies to contribute 2.4 trillion won to the fund  it added that spending from the fund will be directed mainly toward business involved in greenhouse gas emissions reduction and promoting energy efficiency  in addition  the government intends to expand its system of tax breaks to cover new technologies in solar  wind and thermal power  low-emission vehicles  rechargeable batteries and next generation nuclear reactors  71   the government also set a voluntary target last year (2009  to reduce 2020 emissions by four percent on 2005 levels by 2020  and is expected to soon announce plans for carbon trading scheme to begin in 2012.[71   in october 2009 vice finance minister chang sheng-ho announced that taiwan was planning to adopt a carbon tax in 2011.[72  however  premier wu den-yih and legislators stated that the carbon taxes would increase public suffering from the recession and that the government should not levy the new taxes until taiwan s economy has recovered  he opposed the carbon tax  73  many taiwanese citizens are opposed to tax increases as well  however  chung-hua institution for economic research  cier   the think-tank that was commissioned by the government to advise on its plan to overhaul the nation s taxes  had recommended a levy of nt 2,000 (us 61.8  \xa337.6  on each tonne of co2 emissions  cier estimated that taiwan could raise nt 164.7bn (us 5.1bn  \xa33.1bn  from the energy tax and a further nt 239bn (us 7.3bn  \xa34.4bn  from the carbon levy on an annual basis by 2021.[72  if taiwan does pass the carbon tax policy  taiwan would become the first asian country with taxation on carbon emissions  74  due to the amount of revenues from such a comparatively high carbon tax  the government is planning to subsidize low income families and public transportation by using the revenues from carbon taxes  75   on 1 july 2012 the australian federal government introduced a carbon price of aud 23 per tonne of emitted co2-e on selected fossil fuels consumed by major industrial emitters and government bodies such as councils  to offset the impact of the tax on some sectors of society  the government reduced income tax  by increasing the tax-free threshold  and increased pensions and welfare payments slightly to cover expected price increases  as well as introducing compensation for some affected industries  on 17 july 2014  a report by the australian national university estimated that the australian scheme had cut carbon emissions by as much as 17 million tonnes  the biggest annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 24 years of records in 2013 as the carbon tax helped drive a large drop in pollution from the electricity sector  76   on 17 july 2014  the abbott government passed repeal legislation through the senate  and australia became the first nation to abolish a carbon tax  77  in its place the government set up the emission reduction fund  paid by taxpayers from consolidated revenue  which according to reputex  a markets consultancy  estimated the government s main climate policy may only meet a third of the emissions reduction challenge if australia is to cut 2000 levels by 5  by 2020.[78   in 2005  the fifth labour government proposed a carbon tax in order to meet obligations under the kyoto protocol  the proposal would have set an emissions price of nz 15 per tonne of co2-equivalent  the planned tax was scheduled to take effect from april 2007  and applied across most economic sectors though with an exemption for methane emissions from farming and provisions for special exemptions from carbon intensive businesses if they adopted world s-best-practice standards of emissions  79   after the 2005 election  some of the minor parties supporting the fifth labour government  nz first and united future  opposed the proposed tax  and it was abandoned in december 2005.[80  in 2008  the new zealand emissions trading scheme was enacted via the climate change response  emissions trading  amendment act 2008.[81   in europe  a number of countries have imposed energy taxes or energy taxes based partly on carbon content  19  these include denmark  finland  germany  ireland  italy  the netherlands  norway  slovenia  sweden  switzerland  and the uk  none of these countries has been able to introduce a uniform carbon tax for fuels in all sectors  for a review of europe s experience with carbon taxation see andersen (2010).[82   during the 1990s  a carbon energy tax was proposed at the eu level but failed due to industrial lobbying  83  in 2010  the european commission considered implementing a pan-european minimum tax on pollution permits purchased under the european union greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme  eu ets  in which the proposed new tax would be calculated in terms of carbon content rather than volume  so that fuels with high energy concentrations  despite their subsequently high carbon content  will no longer carry the same traditionally low price  84  according to the european commission  the new plan will charge firms a minimum tax per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions 85  at a suggested rate of \u20ac4 to \u20ac30 per tonne of co2.[86   as of the year 2002  the standard carbon tax rate since 1996 amounts to 100 dkk per tonne of co2  equivalent to approximately 13 euros or 18 us dollars   net carbon emission tax from fuel combustion can vary depending on the level of pollution each source emits  the tax rate varies between 402 dkk per tonne of oil to 5.6 dkk per tonne of natural gas and 0 for non-combustible renewables  the rate for electricity is 1164 dkk per tonne or 10 \xf8re per kwh  equivalent to .013 euros or .017 us dollars per kwh  the co2 tax applies to all energy users  including the industrial sector  but the industrial companies can be taxed differently according to two principles  the process the energy is used for  and whether or not the company has entered into a voluntary agreement to apply energy efficiency measures  danish policies like this provide incentives for companies to put in place more sustainable practices similar to a cap and trade program on carbon dioxide  87   in 1992 denmark issued a carbon dioxide tax  which was about $14 for business and $7 for households  per ton of co2   however  denmark offers a tax refund for energy efficient changes  one of the main goals for the tax is to have people change their habits  because most of the money collected would be put into research for alternative energy resources  88   finland was the first country in the 1990s to introduce a co2 tax  initially with few exemptions for specific fuels or sectors  89  since then  however  energy taxation has been changed many times and substantially  these changes were related to the opening of the nordic electricity market  other nordic countries exempted energy-intensive industries  and finnish industries felt disadvantaged by this  finland did place a border tax on imported electricity  but this was found to be out of line with eu single market legislation  changes were then made to the carbon tax to partially exclude energy-intensive firms  this had the effect of increasing the costs of reducing co2 emissions (p  xa016    vourc h and jimenez (2000  p  xa017  stated that arguments based on competitive losses needed to be viewed with caution  for example  they suggested that carbon tax revenues could be used to reduce labour taxes  which would favour the competitiveness of non energy-intensive industries   on september 10  2009  france detailed a new carbon tax with a new levy on oil  gas and coal consumption by households and businesses that was supposed to come into effect on january 1  2010  the new carbon tax would be 17 euros (25 us dollars  per tonne of carbon dioxide (co2  for households and businesses  which will raise the cost of a liter of unleaded fuel by about four cents (25 us cents per gallon   the total estimated income from the carbon tax would have been between 3 and 4.5 billion euros annually  with 55 percent of profit coming from households and 45 percent coming from businesses  90  the tax will not apply to electricity as mostly produced by france s network of nuclear reactors  91   on december 30  the bill was blocked by the french constitutional council  92  it considered the bill included too many exceptions and said they were unconstitutional  it condemned the exemptions for industries as being unequal and inefficient  pointing out that less than half the whole emissions would have been taxed and saying it was unfair to apply the tax only to fuels and heating  which accounted for a limited part of carbon emissions  93  discounts and exceptions would have applied to many aspects of industry and agriculture  including fishing  trucking  and farming  90  french president nicolas sarkozy  despite his vow to  lead the fight to save the human race from global warming   94  did not support the bill  saying that france needed support from the rest of the european union before it would try and proceed with a carbon tax  95   in 2013 carbon tax was again announced for france  prime minister jean-marc ayrault launched the new climate energy contribution  cec  on september 21  2013  the tax will apply at a rate of \u20ac7 tonne co2 in 2014  \u20ac14.50 in 2015 and rising to \u20ac22 in 2016.[96   the german ecological tax reform was adopted in 1999  after that  the ecological law of the country was amended twice-in 2000 and in 2003  first of all  the law provided rung-by-rung growth of the taxes on fuel and fossil fuels and laid the foundation for the tax for energy  only in 2003  after the law s gradual implementation  the amount of emissions reduced by 2.4   which is 20 million tons of co2  thus  the eco-tax is one of the most powerful instruments for climate protection in germany  the number of workplaces rose by 250,000 jobs  97   in 2004  following a policy review  the irish government rejected the introduction of a carbon tax as a policy option  98  however  in 2007 a fianna f xe1il-green party coalition government was formed  and promised to reconsider the matter  in the 2010 budget the country s first carbon tax was introduced  99  the new tax was levied at \u20ac15 per tonne of co2 emissions 100   approx  us 20 per tonne   101   the carbon tax applies to kerosene  marked gas oil  liquid petroleum gas  fuel oil  and natural gas  the natural gas carbon tax does not apply to electricity because the cost of electricity is already included in pricing under the single electricity market  sem   similarly  natural gas users are exempt from the tax if they can prove they are using the gas to  generate electricity  for chemical reduction  or for electrolytic or metallurgical processes   102   a partial relief from the tax is granted for natural gas delivered for use in an installation that is covered by a greenhouse gas emissions permit issued by the environmental protection agency  the natural gas concerned will be taxed at the minimum rate specified in the eu energy tax directive  which is \u20ac0.54 per megawatt hour at gross calorific value   103  pure biofuels are also exempt  104  the economic and social research institute has estimated the tax will cost between about \u20ac2 and \u20ac3 a week per household  or about \u20ac156 per year  105  a survey from the central statistics office reports that ireland s average disposable income was almost \u20ac48,000 in 2007.[106   there is concern that the carbon tax may disproportionately affect elderly persons and low-income households  one group  active retirement ireland  proposes that  an extra allowance of \u20ac4 per week be made to people in receipt of the state pension for the 30 weeks currently covered by the fuel allowance   they suggest that  home heating oil be added to the categories covered under the household benefit package  which is available to older people in receipt of the state pension   107   the tax is paid by companies to the collector general  fraudulent violation is punishable under section 1078 of the taxes consolidation act 1997  which allows for a jail sentence of up to 5 years or a fine of no more than \u20ac126,970  failure to comply with the tax violates section 73 of the finance act of 2010  payment for the first accounting period was due in july 2010.[108   the ngo irish rural link 109  has noted that according to the irish economic and social research institute  esri   a carbon tax would weigh more heavily on rural households   110  irish rural link claim that experience from other countries has shown that carbon taxation will only succeed if it is part of a comprehensive package of measures  which includes reducing some other taxes which does not appear to be the government s approach  111   carbon tax was introduced in ireland in the 2010 budget by the green party  fianna f xe1il coalition government at a rate of \u20ac15 tonne co2 which was applied to motor gasoline and diesel and to home heating oil  diesel   electricity was exempted as electricity generation from fossil fuel power stations was covered under the eu ets  solid fuels including coal and turf were also exempted  112   in 2011 the new government coalition of fine gael and labour raised the carbon tax by 33  to \u20ac20 tonne  farmers were granted a tax relief to compensate for this increase  113   the netherlands initiated a carbon tax in 1990  however  in 1992 it was replaced with a 50/50 carbon energy tax called the environmental tax on fuels  the taxes are assessed partly on carbon content and partly on energy content  the charge was transformed into a tax and became part of general tax revenues  as such  it fell under the administration of the ministry of finance  the general fuel tax is collected on all hydrocarbon fuels  fuels used as raw materials are not subject to the tax  tax rates are based 50/50 on the energy and carbon contents of fuels  in 1996 the regulatory tax on energy  another 50/50 carbon energy tax  was also implemented  the environmental tax and the regulatory tax are 5.16 dutch guilder  or nlg  (~$3.13  or per tonne of co2 and 27.00 nlg (~16.40  per tonne co2 respectively  under the general fuel tax  electricity is not taxed  though fuels used to produce electricity are taxable  energy-intensive industries used to benefit from preferential rates under this tax but the benefit was cancelled in january 1997  also  since 1997 nuclear power has been taxed under the general fuel tax at the rate of nlg 31.95 per gram of uranium-235.38[114][115][116  the european environment agency put out an executive summary stating  although the 5th environmental action programme of the eu in 1992 recommended the greater use of economic instruments such as environmental taxes  there has been little progress in their use since then at the eu level   however   at member state level  there has been a continuing increase in the use of environmental taxes over the last decade  which has accelerated in the last 5\u20136 year   countries including the netherlands and the united kingdom   117   more recently  in 2007  the netherlands introduced a waste fund that is funded by a carbon-based packaging tax  this tax was both used to finance the national treasury and to finance the activities to help reach the goals of recycling 65  of used packaging by 2012.[118  the organization nedvang  nederland van afval naar grondstof or the netherlands from waste to value   which was set up in 2005  is the organization supporting producers and importers of packaged goods reaching individual company goals under the dutch packaging decree  this decree was signed in 2005 and states that producers and importers of packaged goods are responsible for the collection and recycling of that waste  and that at least 65  of that wast has to be recycled  producers and importers can choose to reach the goals on an individual basis or by joining an organization like nedvang  119   the carbon-based tax on packaging was analyzed on behalf of the ministry of infrastructure and the environment and proven to be ineffective  120  therefore  the packaging tax was abolished  producer responsibility activities for packaging are now financed based on private contracts  that have been declared legally binding  121   in january 1991  sweden enacted a co2 tax of 0.25\xa0sek kg per ton ($40 at the time  or eur xa027 at current rates  on the use of oil  coal  natural gas  liquefied petroleum gas  petrol  and aviation fuel used in domestic travel  industrial users paid half the rate  between 1993 and 1997  25  of the rate   and certain high-energy industries such as commercial horticulture  mining  manufacturing and the pulp and paper industry were fully exempted from these new taxes   in 1997 the rate was raised to 0.365\xa0sek kg ($60 per ton  of co2.[122][123  in 2007  the tax was sek xa0930 (eur xa0101  per ton of co2.[124  the full tax is paid in transport  space heating  and non-combined heat and power generation  owing to the many exemptions  oil accounts for 96  of the revenues from the tax  although it produces less than three-quarters of co2 from fuel combustion  citation needed   the tax is credited with spurring a significant move from hydrocarbon fuels to biomass  as the swedish society for nature conservation climate change expert emma lindberg said   it was the one major reason that steered society towards climate-friendly solutions  it made polluting more expensive and focused people on finding energy-efficient solutions   125][126    it increased the use of bioenergy   said university of lund professor thomas johansson  former director of energy and climate at the un development programme   it had a major impact in particular on heating  every city in sweden uses district heating  before  coal or oil were used for district heating  now biomass is used  usually waste from forests and forest industries    economic growth appears to be unaffected  between 1990 and 2006  sweden s economy grew by 44-46 percent  approx 2,8  annually   depending on source  125][126   in 1993  the uk government introduced the fuel duty escalator  fde   an environmental tax on retail petroleum products  the tax was explicitly designed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector  since carbon is in fixed ratio to the quantity of fuel  the fde roughly approximated a carbon tax  the transport lobby in the uk was extremely critical of the fde  the fde  which was the uk s only  real  carbon tax  failed because of the political criticism it provoked  and the automatic increase of the fde was cancelled in 1999.[83  increases in fuel tax have since been discretionary   the politically damaging fuel protests in 2000 contributed to the government decision to reduce the real rates of fuel tax  at the time  tax and duty represented more than 75  of the total pump price  in money terms  the past increments of the fde remain in force  but in real terms  increments have been reduced by the rate of inflation  in 2006  tax represented about \u2154 of the pump price  127   in addition  the uk s climate change levy was introduced in 2001   norway introduced a co2 tax on hydrocarbon fuels in 1991.[128  the tax started at a high rate of us 51 per tonne of co2 on gasoline  with an average tax of us 21 per tonne 129  the tax was also applied to diesel  mineral oil  oil and gas used in north sea extraction activities  130  the international energy agency s  iea  2001 review of norway in the energy policies of iea countries stated that  since 1991 a carbon dioxide tax has applied in addition to excise taxes on fuel   it is among the highest carbon taxes in the oecd  carbon taxation is also applied to the production of oil and gas offshore  the iea estimates for revenue generated by the co2 tax in 2004 were 7,808 million nok 131   about us 1.3 billion in 2010 dollars    according to iea 2005 review of norway  131  norway s co2 tax is its most important climate policy instrument  and covers about 64  of norwegian co2 emissions and 52  of total ghg emissions  some industry sectors have been granted exemptions from the tax to preserve their competitive position  various studies in the 1990s  and an economic analysis by statistics norway  have estimated the effect of the co2 tax to be a reduction of 2.5\u201311  of norwegian emissions under a business-as-usual approach  i e   the predicted emissions that would have occurred without the tax   however  even with the carbon tax  norway s per capita emissions rose by 15  between 1991  when the carbon tax was introduced  and 2008.[132   in attempt to reduce co2 emissions by a larger amount norway implemented the first phase of an emissions trading scheme in 2005[133  and joined the european union emissions trading scheme  eu ets  in 2008.[134  as of 2013  roughly 55  of co2 emissions in norway are taxed and emissions that are not covered by a carbon tax are included in the eu ets  134  certain co2 taxes are applied to emissions that result from petroleum activities on the continental shelf  135  this tax is charged per liter of oil and natural gas liquids produced  as well as per standard cubic meter of gas burnt off or otherwise directly emitted into the air  135  however  this carbon tax is considered a deductible operating cost for petroleum production which can therefore be written off to reduce the ordinary taxes paid by oil companies  135  in 2013  carbon tax rates were doubled in norway to a rate of 0.96 nok per liter standard cubic meter of mineral oil and natural gas  135  as of 2016  the tax rate has been increased to 1,02 nok per liter or standard cubic meter of oil and natural gas  136  despite this increase  there is intention to reduce the tax in the future if there is a rise in the eu ets price from the rate it was when the increased carbon tax rate was implemented  133  according to the norwegian ministry of the environment  co2 taxes have been the most important tool for reducing emissions produced by petroleum activities and there is a low level of co2 emissions per produced oil equivalent  137   in january 2008  switzerland implemented a co2 incentive tax on all hydrocarbon fuels  such as coal  oil and natural gas  unless they are used for energy  gasoline and diesel fuels are not affected by the co2 tax  the tax is collected by the swiss federal customs administration  it is an incentive tax because it is designed to promote the economic use of hydrocarbon fuels  138  the tax amounts to chf 12 per tonne co2  us $11.41 per tonne co2   which is the equivalent of chf 0.03 per litre of heating oil  us $0.108 per gallon  and chf 0.025 per m3 of natural gas  us $0.024 per m3).[139][140  this tax comes from switzerland s 1999 federal law on the reduction of co2 (co2 law   although switzerland prefers to rely on voluntary actions and measures to achieve emissions reductions  the co2 law mandated the introduction of a co2 tax if voluntary measures proved to be insufficient  141  in 2005 the federal government decided that additional measures were needed to achieve emissions reductions and meet kyoto protocol commitments of an 8  reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.[142  in 2007  the co2 tax was approved by the swiss federal council  coming into effect 2008.[139  in 2010  the highest tax rate will be chf 36 per tonne of co2  us $34.20 per tonne co2).[143][144   companies are allowed to exempt themselves from the tax by participating in a swiss cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme where they voluntarily commit to legally binding targets to reduce their co2 emissions  145  under this scheme  emission allowances are given to companies for free  and each year emission allowances equal to the amount of co2 emitted must be surrendered by the company  companies are allowed to sell or trade excess permits  however  should a company fail to surrender the correct amount of allowances  they must pay the co2 tax retroactively for each tonne of co2 emitted since the exemption was granted  142  about 400 companies take part in trading co2 emission credits under this program  in 2009  for the second year in a row  the companies returned enough credits to the swiss government to cover their co2 emissions for the year  the 2009 report shows that companies emitted only about 2.6 million tonnes of co2  falling well below the total permissible quantity of 3.1 million tonnes  146  the swiss carbon market still remains fairly small  with few emissions permits being traded  swiss domestic law tends to favor the use of a co2 tax to achieve emissions reductions and this preference for taxes combined with an immature carbon market could partially explain why switzerland has not yet joined the european union emission trading scheme  eu ets   147   the tax is revenue neutral  and its revenues are redistributed proportionally to companies and to the swiss population  for example  if the population bears 60  of the tax burden  they will receive 60  of the redistribution  for companies  revenues will be redistributed to all companies  except those who chose to exempt themselves from the tax through the cap-and-trade program  143  the revenue is given to the companies in proportion to the total payroll of their employees and is distributed through an ahv compensation fund  federal old age and survivors  insurance  that pays the relevant amount of revenue to the company  148  the revenues from the tax that were paid by the swiss population are redistributed equally to all swiss residents through health insurance companies and a deduction on their insurance premium  143][148  in june 2009 the swiss parliament decided to allocate about one-third of the revenue from the carbon tax to a 10-year building program for climate-friendly building renovations  this program promotes building renovations  the use of renewable energies  the utilization of waste heat  and building engineering  143   as part of the early-redistribution program decided by the swiss federal council in 2009  the tax revenue from 2008  2009 and 2010 are being distributed in 2010.[143  in 2008 alone  the tax of chf 12 per tonne of co2 raised around chf 220 million  us $209 million  in revenue  144  as of june 16  2010  a total of around chf 360 million  us $342 million  have become available for distribution to the swiss population and economy  144][148  it is estimated that in 2010  at the highest tax rate of chf 36 per tonne of co2  the revenue from the tax will be about chf 630 million  us $598 million   144  out of the projected chf 630 million  chf 200 million  us $190 million  will be allocated for the building program and the remaining chf 430 million  us $409 million  will be redistributed in 2010 to the population and the economy  143][144  the international energy agency  iea  commends switzerland s co2 tax for its excellent design and notes that the recycling of the tax revenues to all citizens and enterprises is  sound fiscal practice   142   since 2005  transport fuels in switzerland have been subjected to the climate cent initiative surcharge u2014a surcharge of chf 0.015 per litre on gasoline and diesel  us $.0038 per gallon  which will remain in place until the end of 2012.[140  however  this surcharge can be supplemented with a co2 tax on transport fuels if emissions reductions are not satisfactory  in their 2007 review  the iea recommended that switzerland implement a co2 tax on transport fuels or increase the climate cent surcharge to better balance the high costs of meeting emissions reductions targets across sectors  149   switzerland is currently on track to meet its kyoto protocol commitment of an 8  reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012  the combination of the co2 tax and other voluntary measures by businesses and private individuals is enabling switzerland to achieve these reduction goals  150   in 1997 costa rica imposed a 3.5 percent carbon tax on hydrocarbon fuels  151  a portion of the funds generated by the tax go to  payment for environmental services   psa  program which gives incentives to property owners to practice sustainable development and forest conservation  152  approximately 11  of costa rica s national territory is protected by the plan  153  the program now pays out roughly $15 million a year to around 8,000 property owners  154   in the 2008 canadian federal election a carbon tax proposed by liberal party leader st xe9phane dion  known as the green shift  became a central issue in the campaign  it would have been revenue-neutral  with increased taxation on carbon being balanced by tax cuts for individual citizens  however  it proved to be unpopular and contributed to the defeat of liberal party with its worst share of the popular vote since confederation  155][156][157][158   although there is no federal carbon tax  some canadian provinces do have carbon taxes   the canadian province of quebec became the first in canada to introduce a carbon tax  159][160  the tax was to be imposed on energy producers starting october 1  2007  with revenue collected used for energy-efficiency programs including public transit  the tax rate for gasoline is $cdn0.008 per liter  or about $3.50 per tonne of co n2 equivalent  161   on february 19  2008  the province of british columbia announced its intention to implement a carbon tax of $10 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (co2e  emissions (2.41 cents per litre on gasoline  beginning july 1  2008  making bc the first north american jurisdiction to implement such a tax  the tax will increase each year after until 2012  reaching a final price of $30 per tonne (7.2 cents per litre at the pumps   162][163  unlike previous proposals  legislation will keep the pending carbon tax revenue neutral by reducing corporate and income taxes at an equivalent rate  164  also  the government will also reduce taxes above and beyond the carbon tax offset by $481 million over three years  162  in january 2010  the carbon tax was applied to biodiesel  before the tax actually went into effect  the government of british columbia sent out  rebate cheques  from expected revenues to all residents of british columbia as of december 31  2007.[165  in january 2013  the carbon tax was collecting about $1 billion each year which was used to lower other taxes in british columbia  terry lake  the minister of the environment of british columbia  said  it makes sense  it s simple  it s well accepted   166   the british columbia revenue-neutral carbon tax is based on the following principles   \xb7 all carbon tax revenue is recycled through tax reductions \u2013 the government has a legal requirement to present an annual plan to the legislature demonstrating how all of the carbon tax revenue will be returned to taxpayers through tax reductions  the money will not be used to fund government programs  167   \xb7 the tax rate started low and increases gradually \u2013 starting at a low rate gave individuals and businesses time to make adjustments and respects decisions made prior to the announcement of the tax  167   \xb7 low-income individuals and families are protected \u2013 a refundable low income climate action tax credit is designed to help offset the carbon tax paid by low-income individuals and families  167   \xb7 the tax has the broadest possible base \u2013 virtually all emissions from fuel combustion in b c  captured in environment canada s national inventory report are taxed  with no exemptions except those required for integration with other climate action policies in the future and for efficient administration  167   \xb7 the tax will be integrated with other measures \u2013 the carbon tax will not  on its own  meet b c  s emission-reduction targets  but it is a key element in the strategy  the carbon tax and complementary measures such as a  cap and trade  system will be integrated as these other measures are designed and implemented  167   following implementation many canadians concluded that the carbon tax generally benefitted the british columbian economy  in large part because its revenue neutral feature did indeed reduce personal income taxes  168  however some industries complained loudly that the tax had harmed them  notably cement manufacturers and farmers  169  nevertheless  the tax generated sufficient praise to attract broad attention in the united states and elsewhere from those seeking an economically efficient way of reducing the emission of greenhouse gases without hurting economic growth  170   in july 2007  alberta enacted the specified gas emitters regulation  alta  reg  139/2007,[171   sger   this carbon tax 172][173  requires a $15 tonne contribution be made to the  climate change and emissions management fund   ccemf  by companies that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas annually to either reduce their co2 emissions per barrel by 12 percent  or buy an offset in alberta to apply against their total emissions  174][175][176  in january 2016  the contribution required by large emitters to the ccemf was increased by the provincial government to $20/tonne  177  the tax will fall most heavily on oil companies and coal-fired electricity plants  it intends to give companies a real incentive to lower emissions while fostering technology that makes the job easier  the plan only covers the largest companies that produce 70  of alberta s emissions  176  there are concerns that this is a serious omission because the smallest energy producers are often the most casual about emissions and pollution  176  the carbon tax is currently $20 per tonne  178  because alberta has the highest greenhouse gas emissions in canada the majority of albertans are strongly opposed to a nationwide carbon tax  there is a fear that a nationwide carbon tax would cause alberta s economy to suffer significantly more in proportion to other provinces  alberta is also opposed to a cap and trade system it fears the trades will pull revenue out of the province  a fear not to be dismissed  alberta s local carbon price allows the money to stay within alberta  179   on nov  23  2015  the alberta government announced a new carbon tax scheme very similar to british columbia s in that it will be applied to the entire economy  all businesses and residents will pay a carbon tax based upon the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions  including the burning of wood and biofuels  the tax will come into force in 2017 with a price of $20 per tonne  the price will increase to $30 per tonne in 2018 and increase thereafter by the rate of inflation plus 2    also announced will be the reduction of coal-powered electricity generation  currently  coal provides 51  of the power in the province  the target is to eliminate coal generation by 2030  renewable energy production  primarily wind and solar in alberta  is targeted at 30  of generating capacity by 2030   the effect on consumers will be an increase of 4.49\xa2 per litre for gasoline and $1.011 per gigajoule for natural gas  180  because it is primarily generated from burning hydrocarbons  electricity prices are also expected to rise  although the exact amount is currently unknown  the total personal cost is estimated to be about $300 per household  rebates will be provided to low income earners and temporary rebates provided to exporters to offset competitive disadvantages  181   according to the carbon tax center  182  the united states is one of the few large and industrialized nations on earth that does not implement a carbon tax  one simple solution being considered is to implement a federal carbon emissions tax  instead of relying on states to enforce their own  according to economists a tax would be the simplest and the easiest way to reduce emissions since  primarily  it seems like a plan both parties can get behind since it would not impose strict regulations on business  instead allowing the industries to self regulate  while also a showing that the government is taking steps to protect the environment  furthermore  a tax would lead both producers and consumers to adjust their respective habits accordingly  and in ways that may become more efficient  183      there is also a national movement called citizens  climate lobby to create support across parties to put a national price on carbon   colorado  in november 2006  voters in boulder  colorado passed what is said to be the first municipal carbon tax  it is a tax on electricity consumption  utility bills  with deductions for using electricity from renewable sources  primarily xcel s windsource program   the goal is to reduce carbon emissions to those outlined in the kyoto protocol  specifically to reduce their emissions by 7  below 1990 levels by 2012.[184  tax revenues are collected by xcel energy and are directed to the city s office of environmental affairs to fund programs to reduce community-wide greenhouse gas emissions  185   boulder s climate action plan  cap  tax is expected to raise $1.6 million in 2010  the tax was increased to a maximum allowable rate by voters in 2009 to meet cap goals  currently the tax is set at $0.0049  kwh for residential users  ave  $21 per year   $0.0009  kwh for commercial  ave  $94 per year   and $0.0003  kwh for industrial  ave  $9,600 per year   the revenues from the tax are expected to decrease over time as businesses and residents reduce their energy use and begin to use more solar and wind power  the tax was renewed by voters on november 6  2012.[184   california  in may 2008  the bay area air quality management district  which covers nine counties in the san francisco bay area  passed a carbon tax on businesses of 4.4 cents per ton of co2.[186   in 2006  the state of california  passed ab-32  global warming solutions act of 2006   which requires california to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  to implement ab-32  the california air resources board proposed a carbon tax  but has yet to reach agreement with the western states petroleum association which represents the refineries in the state  the wspa holds that ab-32 only allows a carbon tax to cover administrative costs  187   maryland  in may 2010 montgomery county  maryland passed the nation s first county-level carbon tax  188  the legislation required payments of $5 per ton of co2 emitted from any stationary source emitting more than a million tons of carbon dioxide during a calendar year  189  there is only one source of emissions fitting the criteria laid out by the council  an 850 megawatt coal-fired power plant owned by mirant corporation  the tax was expected to raise between $10 million and $15 million for the county  which faced a nearly $1 billion budget gap  190  the law provided for half of revenue to go toward creating a low interest loan plan for county residents to invest in residential energy efficiency upgrades  189  the county s energy supplier buys its energy at auction  so mirant would have to sell its energy at market value  which meant no discernible increase in energy costs would be felt by the county s residents  in june 2010 the mirant corporation sued the county to stop the tax  191  in june 2011 the federal court of appeals ruled that the tax was a fee imposed  for regulatory or punitive purposes  rather than a tax  and therefore could be challenged in court  192  the county council repealed the fee in july 2012.[193   washington  in 2016  a group of climate activists put an initiative for a revenue-neutral carbon tax on the november ballot in washington state  if approved by voters  it would have imposed a tax on carbon dioxide emissions and used that revenue to decrease the state s sales tax  the business tax  and expand the state s version of the earned income tax credit for low-income workers   cooper (1998  2001)[44  has been a leading proponent of a

of economic advisers under the george w  bush administration  economic adviser to mitt romney for his 2012 presidential campaign and economics professor at harvard university since 1985  has been advocating for increased carbon oil taxation since at least 1999.[195  in 2006  he founded the pigou club of economists advocating for pigovian taxes  a carbon tax chiefly among them  in the club s manifesto  he writes that   h igher gasoline taxes  perhaps as part of a broader carbon tax  would be the most direct and least invasive policy to address environmental concerns   196   in 1979  economist milton friedman expressed support for the idea of a carbon tax in an interview on the the phil donahue show  saying     the best way to  deal with pollution  is to impose a tax on the cost of the pollutants emitted by a car and make an incentive for car manufacturers and for consumers to keep down the amount of pollution   197   in 2001  environmental scientist lester brown  founder of the worldwatch institute and founder and president of the earth policy institute  outlined a detailed  tax shifting  structure which would not lead to an overall higher tax level   it means reducing income taxes and offsetting them with taxes on environmentally destructive activities such as carbon emissions  the generation of toxic waste  the use of virgin raw materials  the use of non-refillable beverage containers  mercury emissions  the generation of garbage  the use of pesticides  and the use of throwaway products    activities that should be discouraged by taxing    198  brown subsequently added that such a tax shift would amount to an  honest market   explaining   the key to restructuring the economy is the creation of an honest market  one that tells the ecological truth   199  in 2011 he estimated the cost of such a tax shift  including the effects of better technology  the use of renewables and  updating the concept of national security   200   former us federal reserve chairman paul volcker suggested  february 6  2007  that  it would be wiser to impose a tax on oil  for example  than to wait for the market to drive up oil prices   clarification needed  201   nasa climatologist james e  hansen has argued in support of a carbon tax  202][203][204][205][206   commencing in north america  the nonprofit citizens climate lobby has been advocating for carbon tax legislation  specifically a progressive fee and dividend model with revenue returned to citizens in the form of a check or rebate   the organization has about 165 chapters in the united states  canada  and several other countries including bangladesh and sweden  207   former united states congressional representative bob inglis  r-south carolina  heads the energy and enterprise initiative at george mason university which is making the conservative case for climate legislation through support for a carbon tax  208   a number of businesses and business leaders also support a carbon tax  these include   monica prasad  a northwestern university sociologist  wrote about denmark s carbon tax in the new york times in 2008.[213  in her view  the danish carbon tax served as an example of how to reduce emissions in the us  prasad argued  however  that a critical component for denmark s success in reducing carbon emissions from 1990\u20132005 was that the tax revenues from the carbon tax were dedicated to subsidies for firms to use for alternative  environmentally cleaner sources of energy   economist laura d andrea tyson wrote in june 2013   the beauty of a carbon tax is its market-based simplicity  economists since adam smith have insisted that prices are by far the most efficient way to guide the decisions of producers and consumers  carbon emissions have an  unpriced  societal cost in terms of their deleterious effects on the earth s climate  a tax on carbon would reflect these costs and send a powerful price signal that would discourage carbon emissions   she listed several prominent economists and political figures that have supported carbon taxes  214   carbon tax now is an online petition for citizens from around the globe to show support for implementing a carbon tax in their country of citizenship  215   in 2016 in washington state  the sierra club  the washington environmental council  climate solutions  and the alliance for jobs and clean energy opposed a proposed tax of $25 per metric ton on fossil fuels because the enactment would undermine state finances  216   an alternative government policy to a carbon tax is a cap on greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions  emission levels of ghgs are capped and permits to pollute are freely allocated  called  grandfathering   or auctioned to polluters  auctioning permits has significant economic advantages over grandfathering  in particular  auctioning raises revenues that can be used to reduce distortionary taxes and improve overall efficiency  217  a market may be allowed for these emission permits so that polluters can trade some or all of their permits with others  cap-and-trade   a hybrid instrument of a cap and carbon tax can be made by creating a price-floor and price-ceiling for emission permits  23  a carbon tax can also be implemented concurrently with a cap  42   unlike a cap system with grandfathered permits  a carbon tax raises revenues  if the revenues are used to reduce other distortionary taxes  this can improve the efficiency of the tax  on the other hand  a cap with grandfathered permits can have an efficiency advantage of being applied to all industries  this provides an equal incentive at the margin for all polluters to reduce their emissions  this is an advantage over a tax that exempts or has reduced rates for certain sectors  217   both cap-and-trade and carbon taxes give polluters a financial incentive to reduce their ghg emissions  carbon taxes provide certainty regarding emission prices  while a cap provides certainty regarding emissions quantity  218  in a literature assessment  fisher et al   (1996:430  concluded that the choice between an international quota  cap  system  or an international carbon tax  remained ambiguous  47  lu et al  (2012  compared a carbon tax  an emission trading  and command-and-control regulation at the industrial level  their abstract concludes that market-based mechanisms would perform better than emission standards in achieving emission targets without affecting industrial production  219   according to the carbon trust (2009   a carbon tax suffers from combining a set price for carbon along with a transfer of revenue from industry to government  218  this  it is argued  guarantees that the tax will not be set at the appropriate level  but will instead be determined by the politics of large-scale revenue transfers  with a cap  however  the revenues from emission allowances can be separately negotiated with industry   another issue with taxes is whether the emissions reductions they bring about actually exist \u2013 that is  the  additionality  of emissions reductions attributable solely to the taxes  carbon trust  2009   additionality usually requires a comparison of observed emission reductions against an estimate of the emission reductions that would have taken place without the presence of the tax  the emissions  baseline    the additionality of a carbon tax  in this sense  is difficult to establish because other policies usually will also have impacts on levels of emissions  e g   subsidies and regulations   as a case in point  greenhouse gas emissions from british columbia had fallen 4.5  between 2007 and 2010 following imposition of its carbon tax  however  it is estimated by the government that most of this decrease is  in fact  attributable to an economic recession  229   there are about usd $550 billion in fossil fuel subsidies annually worldwide  230   in most instances  firms pass the costs of a carbon price onto consumers  studies typically find that poor consumers spend a greater proportion of their income on energy-intensive goods and fuel  and cost increases in energy tend to impact the poor worse than the rich  231  therefore  if the revenue from a carbon tax is retained by the government  a price on carbon is expected to be regressive  similar to any policy that increases the cost of fuels and energy   a study by resources for the future (2014  examined the regressive nature of a carbon tax evaluating three different options for the use of a revenue neutral carbon tax  the study concluded that distributing the fee back to the public as a lump sum payment eliminates the regressive nature of the carbon tax  where people in the lower 60  of income brackets will  on average  perceive a positive impact on their household welfare  232   studies by metcalf et al  (2008  and metcalf (2009  consider the possible distributional impacts of carbon taxes in the united states  233  the 2008 study considers three recent tax bills introduced to the us congress  the taxes themselves are highly regressive  but when revenues from the tax are returned lump-sum  the taxes become progressive  the 2009 study looks at a carbon tax combined with a reduction in payroll taxes  it is found that this combination can be distributionally neutral  with an adjustment in social security payments for the lowest-income households  the carbon tax policy can be made progressive   a study by ekins and dresner (2004  considers the distributional impact in the uk of introducing a carbon tax and increasing fuel duty  234  it is found that a carbon tax can be made progressive  but that the tax would make those currently worst affected by fuel poverty more badly off  of the policy options looked at for transport  the most effective in compensating low-income motorists is found to be an increase in fuel duties and the abolishment of vehicle excise duty   bashmakov et al  (2001  refer to emissions taxes  10  carbon taxes are not identical to emissions taxes  but they can be designed to be a close approximation  5
