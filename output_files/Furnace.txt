Furnace
 a furnace is a device used for high-temperature heating  the name derives from greek word fornax  which means oven  the heat energy to fuel a furnace may be supplied directly by fuel combustion  by electricity such as the electric arc furnace  or through induction heating in induction furnaces   in american english and canadian english usage  the term furnace refers to the household heating systems based upon a central furnace  otherwise known either as a boiler  or a heater in british english  furnace may also be a synonym for kiln  a device used in the production of ceramics   in british english  a furnace is an industrial furnace used for many things  such as the extraction of metal from ore  smelting  or in oil refineries and other chemical plants  for example as the heat source for fractional distillation columns  the term furnace can also refer to a direct fired heater  used in boiler applications in chemical industries or for providing heat to chemical reactions for processes like cracking  and is part of the standard english names for many metallurgical furnaces worldwide       furnaces can be classified into four general categories  based on efficiency and design   the first category would be natural draft  atmospheric burner furnaces  these furnaces consisted of cast-iron or riveted-steel heat exchangers built within an outer shell of brick  masonry  or steel  the heat exchangers were vented through brick or masonry chimneys  air circulation depended on large  upwardly pitched pipes constructed of wood or metal the pipes would channel the warm air into floor or wall vents inside the home  this method of heating worked because warm air rises   the system was simple  had few controls  a single automatic gas valve  and no blower  these furnaces could be made to work with any fuel simply by adapting the burner area  they have been operated with wood  coke  coal  trash  paper  natural gas  and fuel oil  furnaces that used solid fuels required daily maintenance to remove ash and  clinkers  that accumulated in the bottom of the burner area  in later years  these furnaces were adapted with electric blowers to aid air distribution and speed moving heat into the home  gas and oil-fired systems were usually controlled by a thermostat inside the home  while most wood and coal-fired furnaces had no electrical connection and were controlled by the amount of fuel in the burner and position of the fresh-air damper on the burner access door   the second category of furnace is the forced-air  atmospheric burner style with a cast-iron or sectional steel heat exchanger  through the 1950s and 1960s  this style of furnace was used to replace the big  natural draft systems  and was sometimes installed on the existing gravity duct work  the heated air was moved by blowers which were belt driven and designed for a wide range of speeds  these furnaces were still big and bulky compared to modern furnaces  and had heavy-steel exteriors with bolt-on removable panels  energy efficiency would range anywhere from just over 50  to upward of 65  afue  this style furnace still used large  masonry or brick chimneys for flues and was eventually designed to accommodate air-conditioning systems   the third category of furnace is the forced draft  mid-efficiency furnace with a steel heat exchanger and multi-speed blower  these furnaces were physically much more compact than the previous styles  they were equipped with combustion air blowers that would pull air through the heat exchanger which greatly increased fuel efficiency while allowing the heat exchangers to become smaller  these furnaces may have multi-speed blowers and were designed to work with central air-conditioning systems   the fourth category of furnace is the high-efficiency  or condensing furnace  high-efficiency furnaces can achieve from 89  to 98  fuel efficiency  this style of furnace includes a sealed combustion area  combustion draft inducer and a secondary heat exchanger  because the heat exchanger removes most of the heat from the exhaust gas  it actually condenses water vapor and other chemicals  which form a mild acid  as it operates  the vent pipes are normally installed with pvc pipe versus metal vent pipe to prevent corrosion  the draft inducer allows for the exhaust piping to be routed vertically or horizontally as it exits the structure  the most efficient arrangement for high-efficiency furnaces include pvc piping that brings fresh combustion air from the outside of the home directly to the furnace  normally the combustion air  fresh air  pvc is routed alongside the exhaust pvc during installation and the pipes exit through a sidewall of the home in the same location  high efficiency furnaces typically deliver a 25  to 35  fuel savings over a 60  afue furnace   a single-stage furnace has only one stage of operation  it is either on or off  this means that it is relatively noisy  always running at the highest speed  and always pumping out the hottest air at the highest velocity   one of the benefits to a single-stage furnace is typically the cost for installation  single-stage furnaces are relatively inexpensive since the technology is rather simple   this type has two stages of operation  full speed and half  or reduced  speed  depending on the demanded heat  they can run at a lower speed most of the time  they can be quieter  move the air at less velocity  and will better keep the desired temperature in the house   this type of furnace can modulate the heat output and air velocity nearly continuously  depending on the demanded heat and outside temperature  this means that it only works as much as necessary and therefore saves energy   the furnace transfers heat to the living space of the building through an intermediary distribution system  if the distribution is through hot water  or other fluid  or through steam  then the furnace is more commonly called a boiler  one advantage of a boiler is that the furnace can provide hot water for bathing and washing dishes  rather than requiring a separate water heater  one disadvantage to this type of application is when the boiler breaks down  neither heating nor domestic hot water are available   air convection heating systems have been in use for over a century  older systems rely on a passive air circulation system where the greater density of cooler air causes it to sink into the furnace area below  through air return registers in the floor  and the lesser density of warmed air causes it to rise in the ductwork  the two forces acting together to drive air circulation in a system termed  gravity-fed   the layout of these 'octopus u2019 furnaces and their duct systems is optimized with various diameters of large dampered ducts   by comparison  most modern  warm air  furnaces typically use a fan to circulate air to the rooms of house and pull cooler air back to the furnace for reheating  this is called forced-air heat  because the fan easily overcomes the resistance of the ductwork  the arrangement of ducts can be far more flexible than the octopus of old  in american practice  separate ducts collect cool air to be returned to the furnace  at the furnace  cool air passes into the furnace  usually through an air filter  through the blower  then through the heat exchanger of the furnace  whence it is blown throughout the building  one major advantage of this type of system is that it also enables easy installation of central air conditioning  simply by adding a cooling coil at the outlet of the furnace   air is circulated through ductwork  which may be made of sheet metal or plastic  flex  duct  and is insulated or uninsulated  unless the ducts and plenum have been sealed using mastic or foil duct tape  the ductwork is likely to have a high leakage of conditioned air  possibly into unconditioned spaces  another cause of wasted energy is the installation of ductwork in unheated areas  such as attics and crawl spaces  or ductwork of air conditioning systems in attics in warm climates   a home furnace is a major appliance that is permanently installed to provide heat to an interior space through intermediary fluid movement  which may be air  steam  or hot water  heating appliances that use steam or hot water as the fluid are normally referred to as a residential steam boiler or residential hot water boiler  the most common fuel source for modern furnaces in north america and much of europe is natural gas  other common fuel sources include lpg  liquefied petroleum gas   fuel oil and in rare cases coal or wood  in some areas electrical resistance heating is used  especially where the cost of electricity is low or the primary purpose is for air conditioning   modern high-efficiency furnaces can be up to 98  efficient and operate without a chimney  with a typical gas furnace being about 80  efficient  1  waste gas and heat are mechanically ventilated through pvc pipes that can be vented through the side or roof of the house  fuel efficiency in a gas furnace is measured in afue  annual fuel utilization efficiency    in metallurgy  several specialized furnaces are used  these include   an industrial furnace or direct fired heater  is an equipment used to provide heat for a process or can serve as reactor which provides heats of reaction  furnace designs vary as to its function  heating duty  type of fuel and method of introducing combustion air  however  most process furnaces have some common features   fuel flows into the burner and is burnt with air provided from an air blower  there can be more than one burner in a particular furnace which can be arranged in cells which heat a particular set of tubes  burners can also be floor mounted  wall mounted or roof mounted depending on design  the flames heat up the tubes  which in turn heat the fluid inside in the first part of the furnace known as the radiant section or firebox  in this chamber where combustion takes place  the heat is transferred mainly by radiation to tubes around the fire in the chamber
