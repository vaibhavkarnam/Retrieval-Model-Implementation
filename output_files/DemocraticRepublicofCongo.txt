country  the fourth most-populated nation in africa and the eighteenth most populated country in the world   the congolese civil wars  which began in 1996  brought about the end of mobutu sese seko s

dictator mobutu sese seko in 1997.[16   the area now known as the dr congo was populated as early as 80,000 years ago  as shown by the 1988 discovery of the semliki harpoon at katanda  one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found  believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish  17][18   some historians think that bantu peoples began settling in the extreme northwest of central africa at the beginning of the 5th century and then gradually started to expand southward  their propagation was accelerated by the transition from stone age to iron age techniques  the people living in the south and southwest were mostly san bushmen and hunter-gatherer groups  whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies  the development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized agriculture and animal husbandry  this led to the displacement of the hunter-gatherer groups in the east and southeast   the 10th century marked the final expansion of the bantu in west-central africa  rising populations soon made possible intricate local  regional and foreign commercial networks that traded mostly in salt  iron and copper   belgian exploration and administration took place from the 1870s until the 1920s  it was first led by sir henry morton stanley  who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of king leopold ii of belgium  the eastern regions of the precolonial congo were heavily disrupted by constant slave raiding  mainly from arab u2013swahili slave traders such as the infamous tippu tip  19  who was well known to stanley  leopold had designs on what was to become the congo as a colony  20  in a succession of negotiations  leopold  professing humanitarian objectives in his capacity as chairman of the front organization association internationale africaine  actually played one european rival against another  citation needed   leopold formally acquired rights to the congo territory at the conference of berlin in 1885 and made the land his private property  he named it the congo free state  20  leopold s r u0117gime began various infrastructure projects  such as construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the capital of leopoldville  now kinshasa   which took eight years to complete  nearly all such infrastructure projects were aimed at making it easier to increase the assets which leopold and his associates could extract from the colony  21   in the free state  colonists brutalized the local population into producing rubber  for which the spread of automobiles and development of rubber tires created a growing international market  rubber sales made a fortune for leopold  who built several buildings in brussels and ostend to honor himself and his country  to enforce the rubber quotas  the army  the force publique  was called in and made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives a matter of policy  22   during the period of 1885\u20131908  millions of congolese died as a consequence of exploitation and disease  in some areas the population declined dramatically xa0\u2013 it has been estimated that sleeping sickness and smallpox killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower congo river  22  a government commission later concluded that the population of the congo had been  reduced by half  during this period  21  but determining precisely how many people died is impossible  as no accurate records exist   in 1908 the belgian parliament  despite initial reluctance  bowed to international pressure  especially from the united kingdom  and took over the free state from king leopold ii  23  on 18 october 1908 the belgian parliament voted in favour of annexing the congo as a belgian colony  executive power went to the belgian minister of colonial affairs  assisted by a colonial council  conseil colonial   both located in brussels   the belgian parliament exercised legislative authority over the belgian congo  in 1926 the colonial capital moved from boma to l xe9opoldville  some 300 kilometres (190\xa0mi  further upstream into the interior   the transition from the congo free state to the belgian congo was a break but it also featured a large degree of continuity  the last governor-general of the congo free state  baron wahis  remained in office in the belgian congo and the majority of leopold ii s administration with him  24  opening up the congo and its natural and mineral riches to the belgian economy remained the main motive for colonial expansion xa0\u2013 however  other priorities  such as healthcare and basic education  slowly gained in importance   colonial administrators ruled the territory and a dual legal system existed  a system of european courts and another one of indigenous courts  tribunaux indig

 the belgian population of the colony increased from 1,928 in 1910 to nearly 89,000 in 1959   the belgian congo was directly involved in the two world wars  during world war i (1914\u20131918   an initial stand-off between the force publique and the german colonial army in german east africa  tanganyika  turned into open warfare with a joint anglo-belgian invasion of german colonial territory in 1916 and 1917 during the east african campaign  the force publique gained a notable victory when it marched into tabora in september 1916  under the command of general charles tombeur after heavy fighting   after 1918  belgium was rewarded for the participation of the force publique in the east african campaign with a league of nations mandate over the previously german colony of ruanda-urundi  during world war ii  the belgian congo provided a crucial source of income for the belgian government-in-exile in london  and the force publique again participated in allied campaigns in africa  belgian congolese forces under the command of belgian officers notably fought against the italian colonial army in ethiopia in asosa  borta xef and sa xefo under major-general auguste-eduard gilliaert during the second east african campaign  26   in may 1960  a growing nationalist movement  the mouvement national congolais or mnc party  led by patrice lumumba  won the parliamentary elections  patrice lumumba thus became the first prime minister of the democratic republic of the congo  the parliament elected as president joseph kasavubu  of the alliance des bakongo  abako  party  other

within the army to create mutiny  with financial support from the united states and belgium  mobutu paid his soldiers privately  the aversion of western powers to communism and leftist ideology influenced their decision to finance mobutu s quest to neutralize kasavubu and lumumba in a coup by proxy  a constitutional referendum after mobutu s coup of 1965 resulted in the country s official name being changed to the  democratic republic of the congo   1  in 1971 mobutu changed the name again  this time to  republic of zaire   31][14   the new president had the support of the united

human rights violations  political repression  a cult of personality and corruption   corruption became so prevalent the term  le mal zairois  or  zairean sickness   32  meaning gross corruption  theft and mismanagement  was coined  reportedly by mobutu himself  33  international aid  most often in the form of loans  enriched mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one-quarter of what had existed in 1960  zaire became a  kleptocracy  as mobutu and his associates embezzled government funds   in a campaign to identify himself with

longer deemed necessary as a cold war ally  opponents within zaire stepped up demands for reform  this atmosphere contributed to mobutu s declaring the third republic in 1990  whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform  the reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic  mobutu continued in power until armed forces forced him to flee zaire  in 1997   by 1996  following the rwandan civil war and genocide and the ascension of a tutsi-led government in rwanda  rwandan hutu militia forces  interahamwe  fled to eastern zaire and used refugee camps as a base for incursions
