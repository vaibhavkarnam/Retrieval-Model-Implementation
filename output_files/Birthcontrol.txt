Birthcontrol
 birth control  also known as contraception and fertility control  is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy  1  birth control has been used since ancient times  but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century  2  planning  making available  and using birth control is called family planning  3][4  some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally  religiously  or politically undesirable  2   the most effective methods of birth control are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and tubal ligation in females  intrauterine devices  iuds   and implantable birth control  this is followed by a number of hormone based methods including oral pills  patches  vaginal rings  and injections  less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms  diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods  the least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation  sterilization  while highly effective  is not usually reversible  all other methods are reversible  most immediately upon stopping them  5  safe sex practices  such as with the use of male or female condoms  can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections  6  other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases  7  emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex  8][9  some argue not having sex as a form of birth control  but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education  due to non-compliance  10][11   in teenagers  pregnancies are at greater risk of poor outcomes  comprehensive sex education and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group  12][13  while all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people  14  long-acting reversible birth control such as implants  iuds  or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy  13  after the delivery of a child  a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks  some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth  while others require a delay of up to six months  in women who are breastfeeding  progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills  in women who have reached menopause  it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period  14   about 222\xa0million women who want to avoid pregnancy in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method  15][16  birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40   about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008  and could prevent 70  if the full demand for birth control were met  17][18  by lengthening the time between pregnancies  birth control can improve adult women s delivery outcomes and the survival of their children  17  in the developing world women s earnings  assets  weight  and their children s schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control  19  birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children  more women participating in the workforce  and less use of scarce resources  19][20   birth control methods include barrier methods  hormonal birth control  intrauterine devices  iuds   sterilization  and behavioral methods  they are used before or during sex while emergency contraceptives are effective for up to a few days after sex  effectiveness is generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using a given method during the first year  25  and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness  such as tubal ligation  26   the most effective methods are those that are long acting and do not require ongoing health care visits  27  surgical sterilization  implantable hormones  and intrauterine devices all have first-year failure rates of less than 1%.[21  hormonal contraceptive pills  patches or vaginal rings  and the lactational amenorrhea method  lam   if used strictly  can also have first-year  or for lam  first-6-month  failure rates of less than 1%.[27  with typical use first-year failure rates are considerably high  at 9   due to incorrect usage  21  other methods such as condoms  diaphragms  and spermicides have higher first-year failure rates even with perfect usage  27  the american academy of pediatrics recommends long acting reversible birth control as first line for young people  28   while all methods of birth control have some potential adverse effects  the risk is less than that of pregnancy  27  after stopping or removing many methods of birth control  including oral contraceptives  iuds  implants and injections  the rate of pregnancy during the subsequent year is the same as for those who used no birth control  29   for individuals with specific health problems  certain forms of birth control may require further investigations  30  for women who are otherwise healthy  many methods of birth control should not require a medical exam u2014including birth control pills  injectable or implantable birth control  and condoms  31  for example  a pelvic exam  breast exam  or blood test before starting birth control pills does not appear to affect outcomes  32][33  in 2009  the world health organization  who  published a detailed list of medical eligibility criteria for each type of birth control  30   hormonal contraception is available in a number of different forms  including oral pills  implants under the skin  injections  patches  iuds and a vaginal ring  they are currently available only for women  although hormonal contraceptives for men have and are being clinically tested  34  there are two types of oral birth control pills  the combined oral contraceptive pills  which contain both estrogen and a progestogen  and the progestogen-only pills  sometimes called minipills   35  if either is taken during pregnancy  they do not increase the risk of miscarriage nor cause birth defects  33  both types of birth control pills prevent fertilization mainly by inhibiting ovulation and thickening cervical mucous  36][37  their effectiveness depends on the user remembering to take the pills  33  they may also change the lining of the uterus and thus decrease implantation  37   combined hormonal contraceptives are associated with a slightly increased risk of venous and arterial blood clots  38  venous clots  on average  increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years 39  which is still less than that associated with pregnancy  38  due to this risk  they are not recommended in women over 35\xa0years of age who continue to smoke  40  due to the increased risk they are included in decision tools such as the dash score and perc rule used to predict the risk of blood clots  41   the effect on sexual desire is varied  with increase or decrease in some but with no effect in most  42  combined oral contraceptives reduce the risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer  43][44  they often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps  33  the lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness  nausea  and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products  43   progestin-only pills  injections and intrauterine devices are not associated with an increased risk of blood clots and may be used by women with previous blood clots in their veins  38][45  in those with a history of arterial blood clots  non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the injectable version should be used  38  progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and can be used by breastfeeding women as they do not affect milk production  irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods  with some users reporting no periods  46  the progestins drospirenone and desogestrel minimize the androgenic side effects but increase the risks of blood clots and are thus not first line  47  the perfect use first-year failure rate of the injectable progestin  depo-provera  is 0.2   the typical use first failure rate is 6%.[21   three varieties of birth control pills in calendar oriented packaging  birth control pills  a transdermal contraceptive patch  a nuvaring vaginal ring  barrier contraceptives are devices that attempt to prevent pregnancy by physically preventing sperm from entering the uterus  48  they include male condoms  female condoms  cervical caps  diaphragms  and contraceptive sponges with spermicide  48   globally  condoms are the most common method of birth control  49  male condoms are put on a man s erect penis and physically block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner  50  modern condoms are most often made from latex  but some are made from other materials such as polyurethane  or lamb s intestine  50  female condoms are also available  most often made of nitrile  latex or polyurethane  51  male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive  easy to use  and have few adverse effects  52  making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency  53  in japan about 80  of couples who are using birth control use condoms  while in germany this number is about 25%,[54  and in the united states it is 18%.[55   male condoms and the diaphragm with spermicide have typical use first-year failure rates of 18  and 12   respectively  21  with perfect use condoms are more effective with a 2  first-year failure rate versus a 6  first-year rate with the diaphragm  21  condoms have the additional benefit of helping to prevent the spread of some sexually transmitted infections such as hiv aids  5   contraceptive sponges combine a barrier with a spermicide  27  like diaphragms  they are inserted vaginally before intercourse and must be placed over the cervix to be effective  27  typical failure rates during the first year depend on whether or not a woman has previously given birth  being 24  in those who have and 12  in those who have not  21  the sponge can be inserted up to 24\xa0hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward  27  allergic reactions 56  and more severe adverse effects such as toxic shock syndrome have been reported  57   a rolled up male condom   an unrolled male latex condom  a polyurethane female condom  a diaphragm vaginal-cervical barrier  in its case with a quarter u s  coin   a contraceptive sponge set inside its open package   the current intrauterine devices  iud  are small devices  often  t -shaped  often containing either copper or levonorgestrel  which are inserted into the uterus  they are one form of long-acting reversible contraception which are the most effective types of reversible birth control  58  failure rates with the copper iud is about 0.8  while the levonorgestrel iud has a failure rates of 0.2  in the first year of use  59  among types of birth control  they along with birth control implants result in the greatest satisfaction among users  60  as of 2007  iuds are the most widely used form of reversible contraception  with more than 180\xa0million users worldwide  61   evidence supports effectiveness and safety in adolescents 60  and those who have and have not previously had children  62  iuds do not affect breastfeeding and can be inserted immediately after delivery  63  they may also be used immediately after an abortion  64  once removed  even after long term use  fertility returns to normal immediately  65   while copper iuds may increase menstrual bleeding and result in more painful cramps 66  hormonal iuds may reduce menstrual bleeding or stop menstruation altogether  63  cramping can be treated with nsaids  67  other potential complications include expulsion (2\u20135   and rarely perforation of the uterus  less than 0.7%).[63][67  a previous model of the intrauterine device  the dalkon shield  was associated with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease  however the risk is not affected with current models in those without sexually transmitted infections around the time of insertion  68   surgical sterilization is available in the form of tubal ligation for women and vasectomy for men  2  there are no significant long-term side effects  and tubal ligation decreases the risk of ovarian cancer  2  short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a tubal ligation  2][69  after a vasectomy  there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in a week or two  70  with tubal ligation  complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia  71  neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections  2   this decision may cause regret in some men and women  of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation  about 5  regret their decision  as compared with 20  of women aged under 30.[2  by contrast  less than 5  of men are likely to regret sterilization  men more likely to regret sterilization are younger  have young or no children  or have an unstable marriage  72  in a survey of biological parents  9  stated they would not have had children if they were able to do it over again  73   although sterilization is considered a permanent procedure  74  it is possible to attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia  in women the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse  74  pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent  with complications including an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy  74  the number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent  75  rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent  with success being lower the longer the time period between the original procedure and the reversal  75  sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an option in men  76   behavioral methods involve regulating the timing or method of intercourse to prevent introduction of sperm into the female reproductive tract  either altogether or when an egg may be present  77  if used perfectly the first-year failure rate may be around 3.4   however if used poorly first-year failure rates may approach 85%.[78   fertility awareness methods involve determining the most fertile days of the menstrual cycle and avoiding unprotected intercourse  77  techniques for determining fertility include monitoring basal body temperature  cervical secretions  or the day of the cycle  77  they have typical first-year failure rates of 24   perfect use first-year failure rates depend on which method is used and range from 0.4  to 5%.[21  the evidence on which these estimates are based  however  is poor as the majority of people in trials stop their use early  77  globally  they are used by about 3.6  of couples  79  if based on both basal body temperature and another primary sign  the method is referred to as symptothermal  overall first-year failure rates of &lt 2  to 20  have been reported in clinical studies of the symptothermal method  80][81   the withdrawal method  also known as coitus interruptus  is the practice of ending intercourse   pulling out   before ejaculation  82  the main risk of the withdrawal method is that the man may not perform the maneuver correctly or in a timely manner  82  first-year failure rates vary from 4  with perfect usage to 22  with typical usage  21  it is not considered birth control by some medical professionals  27   there is little data regarding the sperm content of pre-ejaculatory fluid  83  while some tentative research did not find sperm  83  one trial found sperm present in 10 out of 27 volunteers  84  the withdrawal method is used as birth control by about 3  of couples  79   though some groups advocate total sexual abstinence  by which they mean the avoidance of all sexual activity  in the context of birth control the term usually means abstinence from vaginal intercourse  85][86  abstinence is 100  effective in preventing pregnancy  however  not everyone who intends to be abstinent refrains from all sexual activity  and in many populations there is a significant risk of pregnancy from nonconsensual sex  87][88   abstinence-only sex education does not reduce teenage pregnancy  7][89  teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education  as compared with comprehensive sex education  89][90  some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method s  available  such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills   91  deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control  92  while this generally avoids pregnancy  pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex and other forms of penis-near-vagina sex  genital rubbing  and the penis exiting from anal intercourse  where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina s lubricating fluids  93][94   the lactational amenorrhea method involves the use of a woman s natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding  95  this usually requires the presence of no periods  exclusively breastfeeding the infant  and a child younger than six months  24  the world health organization states that if breastfeeding is the infant s only source of nutrition  the failure rate is 2  in the six months following delivery  96  six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure rates at 6 months postpartum between 0  and 7.5%.[97  needs update  failure rates increase to 4\u20137  at one year and 13  at two years  98  feeding formula  pumping instead of nursing  the use of a pacifier  and feeding solids all increase its failure rate  99  in those who are exclusively breastfeeding  about 10  begin having periods before three months and 20  before six months  98  in those who are not breastfeeding  fertility may return four weeks after delivery  98   emergency contraceptive methods are medications  sometimes misleadingly referred to as  morning-after pills   100  or devices used after unprotected sexual intercourse with the hope of preventing pregnancy  8  they work primarily by preventing ovulation or fertilization  2][101  they are unlikely to affect implantation  but this has not been completely exclude  101  a number of options exist  including high dose birth control pills  levonorgestrel  mifepristone  ulipristal and iuds  102  levonorgestrel pills  when used within 3\xa0days  decrease the chance of pregnancy after a single episode of unprotected sex or condom failure by 70   resulting in a pregnancy rate of 2.2%).[8  ulipristal  when used within 5\xa0days  decreases the chance of pregnancy by about 85   pregnancy rate 1.4   and might be a little more effective than levonorgestrel  8][102][103  mifepristone is also more effective than levonorgestrel while copper iuds are the most effective method  102  iuds can be inserted up to five xa0days after intercourse and prevent about 99  of pregnancies after an episode of unprotected sex  pregnancy rate of 0.1 to 0.2%).[2][104  this makes them the most effective form of emergency contraceptive  105  in those who are overweight or obese levonorgestrel is less effective and an iud or ulipristal is recommended  106   providing emergency contraceptive pills to women in advance does not affect rates of sexually transmitted infections  condom use  pregnancy rates  or sexual risk-taking behavior  107][108  all methods have minimal side effects  102   dual protection is the use of methods that prevent both sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy  109  this can be with condoms either alone or along with another birth control method or by the avoidance of penetrative sex  110][111  if pregnancy is a high concern using two methods at the same time is reasonable  110  and two forms of birth control is recommended in those taking the anti-acne drug isotretinoin  due to the high risk of birth defects if taken during pregnancy  112   contraceptive use in developing countries is estimated to have decreased the number of maternal deaths by 40   about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008  and could prevent 70  of deaths if the full demand for birth control were met  17][18  these benefits are achieved by reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies that subsequently result in unsafe abortions and by preventing pregnancies in those at high risk  17   birth control also improves child survival in the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies  17  in this population  outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery  17][114  delaying another pregnancy after a miscarriage however does not appear to alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever they are ready  114   teenage pregnancies  especially among younger teens  are at greater risk of adverse outcomes including early birth  low birth weight  and death of the infant  12  in the united states 82  of pregnancies in those between 15 and 19 are unplanned  67  comprehensive sex education and access to birth control are effective in decreasing pregnancy rates in this age group  115   in the developing world  birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children and thus more women participating in the workforce  19  women s earnings  assets  body mass index  and their children s schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control  19  family planning via the use of modern birth control is one of the most cost-effective health interventions  116  for every dollar spent  the united nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved  16  these cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses  116  while all methods are beneficial financially  the use of copper iuds resulted in the greatest savings  116   the total medical cost for a pregnancy  delivery and care of a newborn in the united states is on average $21,000 for a vaginal delivery and $31,000 for a caesarean section as of 2012.[117  in most other countries the cost is less than half  117  for a child born in 2011  an average us family will spend $235,000 over 17 years to raise them  118   globally  as of 2009  approximately 60  of those who are married and able to have children use birth control  119  how frequently different methods are used varies widely between countries  119  the most common method in the developed world is condoms and oral contraceptives  while in africa it is oral contraceptives and in latin america and asia it is sterilization  119  in the developing world overall  35  of birth control is via female sterilization  30  is via iuds  12  is via oral contraceptives  11  is via condoms  and 4  is via male sterilization  119   while less used in the developed countries than the developing world  the number of women using iuds as of 2007 was more than 180\xa0million  61  avoiding sex when fertile is used by about 3.6  of women of childbearing age  with usage as high as 20  in areas of south america  120  as of 2005  12  of couples are using a male form of birth control  either condoms or a vasectomy  with higher rates in the developed world  121  usage of male forms of birth control has decreased between 1985 and 2009.[119  contraceptive use among women in sub-saharan africa has risen from about 5  in 1991 to about 30  in 2006.[122   as of 2012  57  of women of childbearing age want to avoid pregnancy (867 of 1520\xa0million   123  about 222 million women however were not able to access birth control  53\xa0million of whom were in sub-saharan africa and 97\xa0million of whom were in asia  123  this results in 54\xa0million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year  119  part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons  2  while another contributor is poverty  124  due to restrictive abortion laws in sub-saharan africa  many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy  resulting in about 2\u20134  obtaining unsafe abortions each year  124   the egyptian ebers papyrus from 1550\xa0bce and the kahun papyrus from 1850\xa0bce have within them some of the earliest documented descriptions of birth control  the use of honey  acacia leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm  125][126  it is believed that in ancient greece silphium was used as birth control which  due to its effectiveness and thus desirability  was harvested into extinction  127   in medieval europe  any effort to halt pregnancy was deemed immoral by the catholic church  125  although it is believed that women of the time still used a number of birth control measures  such as coitus interruptus and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina  128  women in the middle ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their thighs during sex to prevent pregnancy  129  the oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of dudley castle in england  and are dated back to 1640.[129  they were made of animal gut  and were most likely used to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases during the english civil war  129  casanova  living in 18th century italy  described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy  however  condoms only became widely available in the 20th century  125   the birth control movement developed during the 19th and early 20th centuries  130  the malthusian league  based on the ideas of thomas malthus  was established in 1877 in the united kingdom to educate the public about the importance of family planning and to advocate for getting rid of penalties for promoting birth control  131  it was founded during the  knowlton trial  of annie besant and charles bradlaugh  who were prosecuted for publishing on various methods of birth control  132   in the united states  margaret sanger and otto bobsein popularized the phrase  birth control  in 1914.[133][134  sanger primarily advocated for birth control on the idea that it would prevent women from seeking unsafe abortions  but during her lifetime  she began to campaign for it on the grounds that it would reduce mental and physical defects  135][136  she was mainly active in the united states but had gained an international reputation by the 1930s  at the time  under the comstock law  distribution of birth control information was illegal  she jumped bail in 1914 after her arrest for distributing birth control information and left the united states for the united kingdom  137  in the u k   sanger  influenced by havelock ellis  further developed her arguments for birth control  she believed women needed to enjoy sex without fearing a pregnancy  during her time abroad  sanger also saw a more flexible diaphragm in a dutch clinic  which she thought was a better form of contraceptive  136  once sanger returned to the united states  she established a short-lived birth-control clinic with the help of her sister  ethel bryne  based in the brownville section of brooklyn  new york [138  in 1916  it was shut down after eleven days and resulted in her arrest  139  the publicity surrounding the arrest  trial  and appeal sparked birth control activism across the united states  140  besides her sister  sanger was helped in the movement by her first husband  william sanger  who distributed copies of \u201cfamily limitation  u201d sanger u2019s second husband  james noah h  slee  would also later become involved in the movement  acting as its main funder  136   the first permanent birth-control clinic was established in britain in 1921 by marie stopes working with the malthusian league  141  the clinic  run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors  142  offered women s birth-control advice and taught them the use of a cervical cap  her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by presenting it in scientific terms  in 1921  sanger founded the american birth control league  which later became the planned parenthood federation of america  143  in 1924 the society for the provision of birth control clinics was founded to campaign for municipal clinics  this led to the opening of a second clinic in greengate  salford in 1926.[144  throughout the 1920s  stopes and other feminist pioneers  including dora russell and stella browne  played a major role in breaking down taboos about sex  in april 1930 the birth control conference assembled 700 delegates and was successful in bringing birth control and abortion into the political sphere \u2013 three months later  the ministry of health  in the united kingdom  allowed local authorities to give birth-control advice in welfare centres  145   in 1936 the u s  court ruled in u s  v  one package that medically prescribing contraception to save a persons life or well being was not illegal under the comstock law  following this decision  the american medical association committee on contraception revoked its 1936 statement condemning birth control  a national survey in 1937 showed 71 percent of the adult population supported the use of contraception  by 1938 347 birth control clinics were running in the united states despite their advertisement still being illegal  first lady eleanor roosevelt publicly supported birth control and family planning  146  in 1966  president lyndon b  johnson started endorsing public funding for family planning services  and the federal government began subsidizing birth control services for low-income families  147  the affordable care act  passed into law on march 23  2010 under president barack obama  requires all plans in the health insurance marketplace to cover contraceptive methods  these include barrier methods  hormonal methods  implanted devices  emergency contraceptives  and sterilization procedures  148   in 1909  richard richter developed the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut  which was further developed and marketed in germany by ernst gr xe4fenberg in the late 1920s  149  in 1951  a chemist  named carl djerassi from mexico city made the hormones in progesterone pill using mexican yams  150  djerassi had chemically created the pill but was not equipped to distribute them to patients  meanwhile  gregory pincus and john rock with help from the planned parenthood federation of america developed the first birth control pills in the 1950s  such as mestranol noretynodrel  which became publicly available in the 1960s through the food and drug administration under the name enovid  143][151  medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and mifepristone in the 1980s  152   human rights agreements require most governments to provide family planning and contraceptive information and services  these include the requirement to create a national plan for family planning services  remove laws that limit access to family planning  ensure that a wide variety of safe and effective birth control methods are available including emergency contraceptives  make sure there are appropriately trained healthcare providers and facilities at an affordable price  and create a process to review the programs implemented  if governments fail to do the above it may put them in breach of binding international treaty obligations  153   in america  griswold v  connecticut overturned a state law prohibiting dissemination of contraception information based on a constitutional right to privacy for marital relationships  in 1971  eisenstadt v  baird extended this right to privacy to single people  154   in 2010  the united nations launched the every woman every child movement to assess the progress toward meeting women s contraceptive needs  the initiative has set a goal of increasing the number of users of modern birth control by 120 million women in the world s 69 poorest countries by the year 2020  additionally  they aim to eradicate discrimination against girls and young women who seek contraceptives  155  the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists  acog  recommended in 2014 that oral birth control pills should be over the counter medications  156   since at least the 1870s  american religious  medical  legislative  and legal commentators have debated contraception laws  ana garner and angela michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters  as part of an ongoing attempt to regulate human bodies  in press coverage between 1873-2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women  157   religions vary widely in their views of the ethics of birth control  158  the roman catholic church
