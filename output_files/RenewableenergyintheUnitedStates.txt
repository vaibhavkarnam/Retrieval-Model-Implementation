RenewableenergyintheUnitedStates
 renewable energy in the united states accounted for 13.44 percent of the domestically produced electricity in 2015,[2  and 11.1 percent of total energy generation  3  as of 2014  more than 143,000 people work in the solar industry and 43 states deploy net metering  where energy utilities buy back excess power generated by solar arrays  4   renewable energy reached a major milestone in the first quarter of 2011  when it contributed 11.7 percent of total u s  energy production (2.245 quadrillion btu of energy   surpassing energy production from nuclear power (2.125 quadrillion btu   5  2011 was the first year since 1997 that renewables exceeded nuclear in us total energy production  6   hydroelectric power is currently the largest producer of renewable power in the u s  it produced around 6.14  of the nation s total electricity in 2015 which was 45.71  of the total renewable power in the u s  7  the united states is the fourth largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world after china  canada and brazil  the grand coulee dam is the 5th largest hydroelectric power station in the world   u s  wind power installed capacity now exceeds 72,000 mw and supplies 4.1  of the nation s electricity  8][9  texas is firmly established as the leader in wind power development  followed by iowa and california  10  since the u s  pioneered the technology in 1981 with solar one  several solar thermal power stations have also been built  the largest of these solar thermal power stations are the ivanpah solar power facility (392 mw   southwest of las vegas  and the segs group of plants in the mojave desert  with a total generating capacity of 354 mw  11  large photovoltaic power plants in the usa include solar star (579 mw   near rosamond  california  the desert sunlight solar farm  a 550 mw solar power plant in riverside county  california 12  and the topaz solar farm  a 550 mw photovoltaic power plant  in san luis obispo county  california  13  the geysers in northern california is the largest complex of geothermal energy production in the world   the development of renewable energy and energy efficiency marks  a new era of energy exploration  in the united states  according to president barack obama  14  in a joint address to the congress on february 24  2009  president obama called for doubling renewable energy within the next three years  15  in his 2012 state of the union address  president barack obama restated his commitment to renewable energy and mentioned the long-standing interior department commitment to permit 10,000 mw of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012.[16   renewable energy technologies encompass a broad  diverse array of technologies  including solar photovoltaics  solar thermal power plants and heating cooling systems  wind farms  hydroelectricity  geothermal power plants  and ocean power systems and the use of biomass   the report outlook on renewable energy in america explains that america needs renewable energy  for many reasons   america needs energy that is secure  reliable  improves public health  protects the environment  addresses climate change  creates jobs  and provides technological leadership  america needs renewable energy  if renewable energy is to be developed to its full potential  america will need coordinated  sustained federal and state policies that expand renewable energy markets  promote and deploy new technology  and provide appropriate opportunities to encourage renewable energy use in all critical energy market sectors  wholesale and distributed electricity generation  thermal energy applications  and transportation  17   another benefit of some renewable energy technologies  like wind and solar photovoltaics  pv  is that they require little or no water to generate electricity whereas thermoelectric  fossil fuel based  power plants require vast amounts of water for operation   in 2009  president barack obama in the inaugural address called for the expanded use of renewable energy to meet the twin challenges of energy security and climate change  those were the first references ever to the nation s energy use  to renewable resources  and to climate change in an inauguration speech of a u s  president  president obama looked to the near future  saying that as a nation  the united states will  harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories   18   the president s new energy for america plan calls for a federal investment of $150 billion over the next decade to catalyze private efforts to build a clean energy future  specifically  the plan calls for renewable energy to supply 10  of the nation s electricity by 2012  rising to 25  by 2025.[18   in his joint address to congress in 2009  obama stated that   we know the country that harnesses the power of clean  renewable energy will lead the 21st  century    thanks to our recovery plan  we will double this nation u2019s supply of renewable energy in the next three years    it is time for america to lead again   15   according to clean edge  there s little doubt that the future of energy will be cleaner  the transition from carbon-intensive energy sources like wood  coal  and oil to natural gas and renewables  is well underway  for much of the developed world  and for developing nations  the  future looks increasingly like it will be built off of a mix of energy efficiency  renewables  the electrification of transport  and lower carbon fuels like natural gas   19   a 2010 survey conducted by applied materials shows that two-thirds of americans believe solar technology should play a greater role in meeting the country s energy needs  in addition   three-quarters of americans feel that increasing renewable energy and decreasing u s  dependence on foreign oil are the country s top energy priorities   according to the survey  "67 percent of americans would be willing to pay more for their monthly utility bill if their utility company increased its use of renewable energy   20   in a 2010 chicago council on global affairs public opinion survey  an overwhelming 91 percent believed  investing in renewable energy  is important for the united states to remain economically competitive with other countries  with 62 percent considering this very important  the same poll found strong support for tax incentives to encourage development of renewable energy sources specifically as a way to reduce foreign energy imports  eight in ten (80 percent  favored tax incentives  47 percent strongly  and only 17 percent were opposed  21   as of 2011  new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources  and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies is needed   several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain  new epa initiatives targeting air toxics  coal ash  and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies  the use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny  with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions  concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants  particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages  events at the fukushima nuclear plant have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term  further  cost estimates for \u201cnext generation u201d nuclear units continue to climb  and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees  22   renewable energy in the united states accounted for 13.44 percent of the domestically produced electricity in 2015.[23  california is a leading state and around 29 percent of california s electricity comes from rps eligible renewable sources  including hydropower   24   the united states has some of the best renewable energy resources in the world  which have the potential to meet a rising and significant share of the nation s energy demand  a quarter of the u s  land area has winds strong enough to generate electricity at the same price as natural gas and coal  25   many of the new technologies that harness renewables \u2014 including wind  solar  geothermal  and biofuels \u2014 are  or soon will be  economically competitive with the fossil fuels that meet 85 percent of u s  energy needs  dynamic growth rates are driving down costs and spurring rapid advances in technologies  25  energy technologies also receive government subsidies  in 2013  federal government energy-specific subsidies and supports for renewables  fossil fuels  and nuclear were $15.043 billion  $3.431 billion and $1.66 billion respectively  the subsidies and supports specific to electricity production amount to $11.678 billion  $1.591 billion and $1.66 billion respectively  26   all but a few u s  states now have incentives in place to promote renewable energy  while more than a dozen have enacted new renewable energy laws in recent years  25   renewable energy suffered a political setback in the united states in september 2011 with the bankruptcy of solyndra  a company that had received a $535 million federal loan guarantee  27][28   the united states used about 4,000 billion kwh year of electricity in 2012  and about 98 quadrillion btu year (30,000 billion kwh   efficiency improvements are expected to reduce usage to 15,000 billion kwh by 2050  the united states has the potential of installing 11 million mw of onshore wind power and 4 million mw of offshore wind power  capable of generating over 47,000 billion kwh  the u s  has the potential of installing 10 to 20 million mw of concentrated solar power in the southwest  capable of generating over 10,000 billion kwh  30   will result in a total of 627.7 giga kilowatt hours  g kwh  of renewable electric energy in 2019  this would be up 89.4 g kwh (+16.7   from 2014   hydroelectric power is currently the largest producer of renewable power in the u s  it produced around 6.14  of the nation s total electricity in 2015 which was 45.71  of the total renewable power in the u s  34  the united states is the fourth largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world after china  canada and brazil  the grand coulee dam is the 5th largest hydroelectric power station in the world and another six u s  hydro plants are among the 50 largest in the world  the amount of hydroelectric power generated is strongly affected by changes in precipitation and surface runoff   hydroelectric plants exist in at least 34 us states  hydroelectricity projects such as hoover dam  grand coulee dam  and the tennessee valley authority have become iconic large construction projects   the contribution over the last eleven years of hydroelectric power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the hydroelectric power generation for 2015  this shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to resource availability and needs   us wind energy capacity nearly tripled from 2008 to 2015  wind supplied nearly 5  of total us electricity generation in 2015  there was ca 90,000 u s  wind operations jobs in 2015  wind and solar accounted for two-thirds of new energy installations in the us in 2015.[39   u s  wind power installed capacity now exceeds 72 gw  32  this capacity is exceeded only by china  the 1,320mw alta wind energy center is the largest wind farm in the world  shepherds flat wind farm in oregon is the second largest wind farm in the world  completed in 2012  with the nameplate capacity of 845 mw  40   the u s  wind industry generates tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity  41  wind projects boost local tax bases  and revitalize the economy of rural communities by providing a steady income stream to farmers with wind turbines on their land  38  ge energy is the largest domestic wind turbine manufacturer  38  in 2013 wind power received $5.936 billion in federal funding  which is 37  of all federal funding for electrity generation  26   in 2012 there were 8,900 mw under construction in nearly 100 projects  42  the united states has the potential of installing 10 million mw of onshore wind power and 4 million mw of offshore wind  43  the u s  department of energy u2019s report 20  wind energy by 2030 envisioned that wind power could supply 20  of all u s  electricity  which included a contribution of 4  from offshore wind power  41  additional transmission lines will need to be added  to bring power from windy states to the rest of the country  44  in august 2011  a coalition of 24 governors asked the obama administration to provide a more favorable business climate for the development of wind power  45   these are the largest wind farms in the united states  as of 2017   the contribution over the last eleven years of wind electric power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the wind electric power generation for 2015  this shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to wind availability   solar power will be discussed in three distinct varieties   electric energy is generated by two different methods -thermal and photovoltaic  application is either utility scale for electric grid power generation or much smaller distributed systems which may or may not be integrated into the electric grid  utility grade systems have well documented generation but distributed systems contributions to user electric power needs are not measured or controlled  therefore  quantitative evaluation of distributive solar to the overall us electric power environment has been lacking  recently  the energy information administration  53][54  has begun estimating that contribution   in 2015  utility scale solar 36  contributed 26.47 g kwh  billion kwh  to the grid with 23.233 g kwh from photovoltaics and 3.24 g kwh from thermal systems  in 2014 and 2015  eia estimated that distributed solar gt  54  generated 9.536 g kwh and 12.141 g kwh respectively   prior to 2012  in six southwestern states  arizona  california  colorado  nevada  new mexico  and utah  the us bureau of land management owned nearly 98 million acres  an area larger than the state of montana  that was open to proposals for solar power installations  to streamline consideration of applications  the blm produced a programmatic environmental impact statement  peis   by the subsequent record of decision in october 2012  the blm withdrew 78 percent of its land from possible solar development  leaving 19 million acres still open to applications for solar installations  an area nearly as large as south carolina  of the area left open to solar proposals  the blm has identified 285 thousand acres in 17 highly favorable areas it calls solar energy zones  55][56][57][57   solar energy generating systems  segs  is the name given to nine solar power plants in the mojave desert  segs i-vii are located at kramer junction  and segs viii and ix are at harper lake and barstow respectively  the segs power plants were commissioned between 1984 and 1991.[11   the installation uses parabolic trough solar thermal technology along with natural gas to generate electricity  the facility has a total of 400,000 mirrors and covers 1,000 acres (4\xa0km xb2   the plants have a total generating capacity of 354 mw  11   nevada solar one generates 64mw of power and in boulder city  nevada  and was built by the u s  department of energy  doe   national renewable energy laboratory  nrel   and solargenix energy  nevada solar one started producing electricity in june 2007   nevada solar one uses parabolic troughs as thermal solar concentrators  heating tubes of liquid which act as solar receivers  these solar receivers are specially coated tubes made of glass and steel  about 19,300 of these 4 metre long tubes are used in the newly built power plant  nevada solar one also uses a technology that collects extra heat by putting it into phase-changing molten salts  this energy can then be drawn on at night  58   solar thermal power plants designed for solar-only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in prosperous areas with significant cooling demands  such as the south-western united states  using thermal energy storage systems  solar thermal operating periods can even be extended to meet base-load needs  59   the ivanpah solar power facility is a 392 megawatt  mw  solar power facility which is located in south-eastern california  60  the facility formally opened on february 13  2014.[61   the solana generating station is a 280 mw solar power plant which is near gila bend  arizona  about 70

project near tonopah  about 190 miles (310\xa0km  northwest of las vegas  62   a 2013 study by the us national renewable energy laboratory concluded that utility-scale solar power plants directly disturb an average of 2.7 to 2.9 acres per gigawatt-hour year  and use from 3.5 to 3.8 acres per gw-hr year for the entire sites  according to a 2009 study  this intensity of land use is less than that of the average us power plant using surface-mined coal  63  some of the land in the eastern portion of the mojave desert is to be preserved  but the solar industry is more interested in areas of the western desert   where the sun burns hotter and there is easier access to transmission lines   64   the contribution to the us electric grid over the last eleven years of solar thermal electric power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the solar thermal power generation for 2014 and 2015  this shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to sunlight availability  before 2008  most solar-generated electric energy was from thermal systems  by 2011  photovoltaics had overtaken thermal   at the end of 2014  the u s  had 18.3 gigawatts  gw  of installed photovoltaic capacity with an additional 1.7 gw of concentrated solar power  66  the u s  pioneered solar farms and many key developments in photovoltaics came out of u s  research   the u s  has some of the largest solar farms in the world  solar star is a 579 megawatt  mwac  farm near rosamond  california  completed in june 2015  it uses 1.7 million solar panels  spread over 13 square kilometers (3,200 acres   67][68][69  the desert sunlight solar farm is a 550 mw solar power plant in riverside county  california

project is a 485 mw photovoltaic station planned for riverside county  california   many schools and businesses have building-integrated photovoltaic solar panels on their roof  most of these are grid connected and use net metering laws to allow use of electricity in the evening that was generated during the daytime  new jersey leads the nation with the least restrictive net metering law  while california leads in total number of homes which have solar panels installed  many were installed because of the million solar roof initiative  70  california decided that it is not moving forward fast enough on photovoltaic generation and in 2008 enacted a feed-in tariff  washington state has a feed-in tariff of 15 \xa2 kwh which increases to 54 \xa2 kwh if components are manufactured in the state  71  by 2015  california  hawaii  arizona and some other states were lowering payments to distributed solar owners and instituting new fees for grid usage  tesla and a handful of other companies were promoting household grid-tied batteries while some electric companies were investing in utility-scale grid energy storage including very large batteries   the contribution to the us electric grid over the last ten years of solar photovoltaic electric power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the photovoltaic power generation for 2014 and 2015  this shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to sunlight availability  before 2008  most solar-generated electric energy was from thermal systems  by 2011  photovoltaics had overtaken thermal   beginning with the 2014 data year  energy information administration will estimate distributed solar photovoltaic generation and distributed solar photovoltaic capacity  53  these non-utility scale estimates project that  in 2014 the usa  generated a further 9.536 gwh and in 2015 an additional 12.141 gwh of solar electricity from such distributed pv systems  54   the usa is the world leader in online capacity and the generation of electricity from geothermal energy  72  according to 2014 state energy data  geothermal energy provided approximately 16 billion kilowatt hours  kwh  of electricity u20140.31  of the electricity consumed in the u s  as of may 2007  geothermal electric power was generated in five u s  states  alaska  california  hawaii  nevada  and utah  according to the geothermal energy association s recent report  there were 75 new geothermal power projects underway in 12 states as of may 2007   this is an increase of 14 projects in an additional three states compared to a survey completed in november 2006.[72   the most significant catalyst behind new industry activity is the energy policy act of 2005  this act made new geothermal plants eligible for the full federal production tax credit  previously available only to wind power projects  it also authorized and directed increased funding for research by the department of energy  and gave the bureau of land management new legal guidance and secure funding to address its backlog of geothermal leases and permits  72   installed geothermal capacity in megawatts  mw  by state as of february 2013:[73   the contribution over the last eleven years of geothermal power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the geothermal power generation for 2014   the u s  department of energy stated  in 2006  that more than 1.5 million homes and businesses were currently using solar water heating in the united states  representing a capacity of over 1,000 megawatts  mw  of thermal energy generation  it predicted that another 400 mw was likely to be installed over the next 3\u20135 years   assuming that 40 percent of existing homes in the united states have adequate access to sunlight  29 million solar water heaters could be installed  74   solar water heaters can operate in any climate  performance varies depending on how much solar energy is available at the site  as well as how cold the water coming into the system is  the colder the water  the more efficiently the system operates  74   solar water heaters reduce the need for conventional water heating by about two-thirds and pay for their installation within 4 to 8 years with electricity or natural gas savings  compared to those with electric water heaters  florida homeowners with solar water heaters save 50 to 85 percent on their water heating bills  according to the florida solar energy center  74   in 2015  biomass generated 64.19 million megawatt-hours  1.57  of total us generated electricity  it was the largest source of total renewable energy in the us  and the third-largest renewable source of electrical power in the us  after hydropower and wind  75   biomass is biological material derived from living  or recently living organisms  such as plants and trees and utilizes wastes or plant matter specifically grown to generate electricity or produce heat  the main advantage of using grown fuels  as opposed to fossil fuels such as coal  natural gas and oil  is that while they are growing they absorb the near-equivalent in carbon dioxide  an important greenhouse gas  to that which is later released in their burning  although there is some debate over the net carbon neutrality and near term affects of using the biomass for energy a key difference is the relatively short carbon recycle period of grown biomass  several years or decades  as opposed to the millions of years it took to turn carbon into fossil fuels  with proper conservation and growing techniques biomass can be an important renewable energy source   biomass can be utilized for all three major energy needs  electricity  heating cooling and transportation fuels  however  each usage is distinctly different from the others  especially regarding efficiency - the percentage of energy utilized from the biomass source  whereas pellets for heating can be up to 90  efficient  bio-electricity plants are comparable to coal power plants  with around 30  efficiency  and biofuels from crops or algae even less   biomass electric generation data combines two basic categories  1  wood and wood derived fuels including wood wood waste solids  including paper pellets  railroad ties  utility poles  wood chiips  bark and wood waste solids   wood waste liquids  red liquor  sludge wood  spent sulfite liquor  and other wood based liquids   and black liquor  and  2  other biomass fuels include municipal solid waste  landfill gas  sludge waste agricultural byproducts  other biomass solids  other biomass liquids  and other biomass gases  including digester gases  methane  and other biomass gases   the contribution from these two categories over the last ten years of biomass electric power to the renewable power generation and to the total us power generation is shown below along with the yearly profile of the electric power generation for 2014 and 2015  this shows the typical variations over the months of the year due to fuel availability and needs     most cars on the road today in the u s  can run on blends of up to 10  ethanol  and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends  ford  daimlerchrysler  and gm are among the automobile companies that sell \u201cflexible-fuel u201d cars  trucks  and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 85  ethanol (e85   by mid-2006  there were approximately six million e85-compatible vehicles on u s  roads  77   the challenge is to expand the market for biofuels beyond the farm states where they have been most popular to date  78  flex-fuel vehicles are assisting in this transition because they allow drivers to choose different fuels based on price and availability  the energy independence and security act of 2007  which calls for 15.2\xa0billion us gallons (58,000,000\xa0m3  of biofuels to be used annually by 2012  will also help to expand the market  77   the expanding ethanol and biodiesel industries are providing jobs in plant construction  operations  and maintenance  mostly in rural communities  according to the renewable fuels association  the ethanol industry created almost 154,000 u s  jobs in 2005 alone  boosting household income by $5.7 billion  it also contributed about $3.5 billion in tax revenues at the local  state  and federal levels  77  on the other hand  in 2010  the biofuel industry received $6644 million in federal government support  79   wave power in the united states is under development in several locations off the east and west coasts as well as hawaii  it has moved beyond the research phase and is producing reliable energy  its use to-date has been for situations where other forms of energy production are not economically viable and as such  the power output is currently modest  but major installations are planned to come on-line within the next few years  citation needed   there are numerous organizations within the academic  federal  and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of renewable energy  this research spans several areas of focus across the renewable energy spectrum  most of the research is targeted at improving efficiency and increasing overall energy yields  80  multiple federally supported research organizations have focused on renewable energy in recent years  two of the most prominent of these labs are sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory  nrel   both of which are funded by the united states department of energy and supported by various corporate partners  81  sandia has a total budget of $2.4 billion 82  while nrel has a budget of $375 million  83   both sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory  nrel   have heavily funded solar research programs  british petroleum was also heavily invested in solar research programs until 2008 when the company began scaling back its solar operations  the company finally shut down its forty-year-old solar business after executives decided solar power production is not economically competitive  84  the nrel solar program has a budget of around $75 million 85  and develops research projects in the areas of photovoltaic  pv  technology  solar thermal energy  and solar radiation  86  the budget for sandia u2019s solar division is unknown  however it accounts for a significant percentage of the laboratory u2019s $2.4 billion budget  87  several academic programs have focused on solar research in recent years  the solar energy research center  serc  at university of north carolina  unc  has the sole purpose of developing cost effective solar technology  in 2008  researchers at massachusetts institute of technology  mit  developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water  88  such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining  in february 2012  north carolina-based semprius inc   a solar development company backed by german corporation siemens  announced that they had developed the world u2019s most efficient solar panel  the company claims that the prototype converts 33.9  of the sunlight that hits it to electricity  more than double the previous high-end conversion rate  89   wind energy research dates back several decades to the 1970s when nasa developed an analytical model to predict wind turbine power generation during high winds  90  today  both sandia national laboratories and national renewable energy laboratory have programs dedicated to wind research  sandia u2019s laboratory focuses on the advancement of materials  aerodynamics  and sensors  91  the nrel wind projects are centered on improving wind plant power production  reducing their capital costs  and making wind energy more cost effective overall  92  the field laboratory for optimized wind energy  flowe  at caltech was established to research renewable approaches to wind energy farming technology practices that have the potential to reduce the cost  size  and environmental impact of wind energy production  93   as the primary source of biofuels in north america  many organizations are conducting research in the area of ethanol production  on the federal level  the usda conducts a large amount of research regarding ethanol production in the united states  much of this research is targeted toward the effect of ethanol production on domestic food markets  94  the national renewable energy laboratory has conducted various ethanol research projects  mainly in the area of cellulosic ethanol  95  cellulosic ethanol has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol  it does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood  grasses  or non-edible parts of plants  96  moreover  some studies have shown cellulosic ethanol to be more cost effective and economically sustainable than corn-based ethanol  97  sandia national laboratories conducts in-house cellulosic ethanol research 98  and is also a member of the joint bioenergy institute  jbei   a research institute founded by the united states department of energy with the goal of developing cellulosic biofuels  99   over $1 billion of federal money has been spent on the research and development of hydrogen fuel in the united states  100  both the national renewable energy laboratory 101  and sandia national laboratories 102  have departments dedicated to hydrogen research   in his january 24  2012  state of the union address  president barack obama restated his commitment to renewable energy  stating that he \u201cwill not walk away from the promise of clean energy  u201d obama called for a commitment by the defense department to purchase 1,000 mw of renewable energy  he also mentioned the long-standing interior department commitment to permit 10,000 mw of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012.[16   the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 included more than $70 billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs  this policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in u s  history for renewable energy  advanced transportation  and energy conservation initiatives  these new initiatives were expected to encourage many more utilities to strengthen their clean energy programs  103  while the department of energy has come under criticism for providing loan guarantees to solyndra  104  its sunshot initiative has funded successful companies such as energysage 105  and zep solar  106   in february 2011  the u s  department of energy  doe  launched its sunshot initiative  a collaborative national effort to cut the total cost of photovoltaic solar energy systems by 75  by 2020.[107  reaching this goal would make unsubsidized solar energy

different solar energy application solutions were developed in 60 days  109  in 2011  the price was $4 w  and the sunshot goal of $1 w by 2020 was reached in 2017.[110   wind powering america  wpa  is another doe initiative that seeks to increase the use of wind energy  wpa collaborates with state and regional stakeholders  including farmers  ranchers  native americans  rural electric cooperatives  consumer-owned utilities and schools  citation needed   wpa has focused on states with strong potential for wind energy generation but with few operational projects  wpa provides information about the challenges  benefits  and impacts of wind technology implementation   the solar america initiative (sai  111  is a part of the federal advanced energy initiative to accelerate the development of advanced photovoltaic materials with the goal of making it cost-competitive with other forms of renewable electricity by 2015   the doe solar energy technology program  setp  intended to achieve the goals of the sai through partnerships and strategic alliances by focusing primarily on four areas   as part of former governor arnold schwarzenegger s million solar roofs program  california set a goal to create 3,000 megawatts of new  solar-produced electricity by 2017  with funding of $2.8 billion  112   the california solar initiative offers cash incentives on solar pv systems of up to $2.50 a watt  these incentives  combined with federal tax incentives  can cover up to 50  of the total cost of a solar panel system  112  financial incentives to support renewable energy are available in some other us states  113   environmental protection agency facilities in the united states use renewable energy for all or part of their supply at the following facilities   the epa named the top 20 partners in its green power partnership that are generating their own renewable energy on-site  combined  they generate more than 736 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy on-site each year  enough to power more than 61,000 average u s  homes  115   a renewable portfolio standard refers to legislation that creates a market in tradeable renewable or green electricity certificates  electricity distributors or wholesaler purchasers of electricity are required to source a specified percentage of their electricity  portfolio  from renewable generation sources  liable entities that fall short of their quota can purchase certificates from accredited suppliers who have generated renewable electricity and obtained and registered certificates to sell on that market   the energy policy act of 2005 requires all public electric utilities to facilitate net metering  116  this allows homes and businesses performing distributed generation to pay only the net cost of electricity from the grid  electricity used minus electricity produced locally and sent back into the grid  for intermittent renewable energy sources this effectively uses the grid as a battery to smooth over lulls and fill in production gaps   some jurisdictions go one step further and have instituted feed-in tariff  which allows any power customer to actually make money by producing more renewable energy than is consumed locally   from 2006-14  us households received more than $18 billion in federal income tax credits for weatherizing their homes  installing solar panels  buying hybrid and electric vehicles  and other  clean energy  investments  these tax expenditures went predominantly to higher-income americans  the bottom three income quintiles received about 10  of all credits  while the top quintile received about 60   the most extreme is the program aimed at electric vehicles  where the top income quintile received about 90  of all credits  market mechanisms have less skewed distributional effects  117   the american council on renewable energy  acore   is a non-profit organization with headquarters in washington dc  it was founded in 2001 as a unifying forum for bringing renewable energy into the mainstream of american u2019s economy and lifestyle  in 2010 acore had over 700 member organizations  118  in 2007  acore published outlook on renewable energy in america  a two volume report about the future of renewable energy in the united states  119  it has been said that this report exposes a  new reality for renewable energy in america   120   the environmental and
