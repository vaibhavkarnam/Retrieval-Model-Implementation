EasternEurope
 eastern europe  also known as east europe  is the eastern part of the european continent  there is no consensus on the precise area it covers  partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical  geographical  cultural  and socioeconomic connotations  there are  almost as many definitions of eastern europe as there are scholars of the region   1  a related united nations paper adds that  every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct   2   one definition describes eastern europe as a cultural  and econo-cultural  entity  the region lying in europe with main characteristics consisting in byzantine  orthodox  and some turco-islamic influences  2][3  another definition was created during the cold war and used more or less synonymously with the term eastern bloc  a similar definition names the formerly communist european states outside the soviet union as eastern europe  3  historians and social scientists generally view such definitions as outdated or relegating  4][5][6][7][8  but they are still sometimes used for statistical purposes  9][10][11       several definitions of eastern europe exist today  but they often lack precision or are extremely general  these definitions vary both across cultures and among experts  even political scientists  recently becoming more and more imprecise  12   the ural mountains  ural river  and the caucasus mountains are the geographical land border of the eastern edge of europe  in the west  however  the cultural and religious boundaries of  eastern europe  are subject to considerable overlap and  most importantly  have undergone historical fluctuations  which make a precise definition of the western boundaries of eastern europe and the geographical midpoint of europe somewhat difficult   eurovoc  a multilingual thesaurus maintained by the publications office of the european union  provides entries for "23 eu languages  13   bulgarian  croatian  czech  danish  dutch

above-mentioned countries as strictly central european  hungary  poland  slovakia  czech republic  slovenia   15][16][17][18][19   \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0catholic christianity

final stages of world war ii  the area eventually came to encompass all the european countries which were under soviet influence  countries which had communist governments in the postwar era (1945-1991   and neutral countries were classified by the nature of their political regimes   the cold war increased the number of reasons for the division of europe into two parts along the borders of nato and warsaw pact states   see  the cold war section   the economic organisation connecting the countries was the council for mutual economic assistance   since the great schism of 1054  europe has been divided between roman catholic and protestant churches in the west  and the eastern orthodox christian  many times incorrectly labeled  greek orthodox   churches in the east  due to this religious cleavage  eastern orthodox countries are often associated with eastern europe  a cleavage of this sort is  however  often problematic  for example  greece is overwhelmingly orthodox  but is very rarely included in  eastern europe   for a variety of reasons  20   the fall of the iron curtain brought the end of the east u2013west division in europe  21  but this geopolitical concept is sometimes still used for quick reference by the media  22   eurovoc  national geographic society  committee for international cooperation in national research in demography  stw thesaurus for economics and most other modern sources place the baltic states in northern europe whereas the cia world factbook  amp  unesco place the region in eastern europe with a strong assimilation to northern europe  the baltic states have seats in the nordic council as observer states  they also are members of the nordic-baltic eight whereas eastern european countries formed their own alliance called the visegr xe1d group  the northern future forum  the nordic investment bank and nordic battlegroup are other examples of northern european cooperation that includes the three baltic states that make up the baltic assembly   the caucasus nations are often included in definitions of eastern europe or histories of eastern europe  however  the extent of their geographic or political affiliation with europe varies by country  all three states are members of the european union s eastern partnership program and the euronest parliamentary assembly  on 12 january 2002  the european parliament noted that armenia and georgia may enter the eu in the future  24   there are 3 de-facto independent republics with limited recognition in the caucasus region  all 3 states participate in the community for democracy and rights of nations   several other former soviet republics may be considered part of eastern europe  disputed states   the term  central europe  is often used by historians to designate states formerly belonging to the holy roman empire or the polish u2013lithuanian commonwealth  including parts of modern-day belarus and ukraine   central europe  thus overlaps with  eastern europe   the following countries are labeled eastern european by some commentators and as central european by others  28][29][30   most southeastern european states did not belong to the eastern bloc  save bulgaria  romania  and for a short time  albania  although some of them were represented in the cominform  only some of them can be included in the classical former political definition of eastern europe  some can be considered part of southern europe  10  however  most can be characterized as belonging to south-eastern europe  but some of them may also be included in central europe or eastern europe  37   partially recognized states   ancient kingdoms of the region included orontid armenia albania  colchis and iberia  these kingdoms were either from the start  or later on incorporated into various iranian empires  including the achaemenid persian  parthian  and sassanid persian empires  44  parts of the balkans and more northern areas were ruled by the achaemenid persians as well  including thrace  paeonia  macedon  and most of the black sea coastal regions of romania  ukraine  and russia  45][46  owing to the rivalry between parthian iran and rome  and later byzantium and the sassanid persians  the former would invade the region several times  although it was never able to hold the region  unlike the sassanids who ruled over most of the caucasus during their entire rule  47   the earliest known distinctions between east and west in europe originate in the history of the roman republic  as the roman domain expanded  a cultural and linguistic division appeared between the mainly greek-speaking eastern provinces which had formed the highly urbanized hellenistic civilization  in contrast the western territories largely adopted the latin language  this cultural and linguistic division was eventually reinforced by the later political east u2013west division of the roman empire  the division between these two spheres was enhanced during late antiquity and the middle ages by a number of events  the western roman empire collapsed starting the early middle ages  by contrast  the eastern roman empire  mostly known as the byzantine empire  managed to survive and even to thrive for another 1,000 years  the rise of the frankish empire in the west  and in particular the great schism that formally divided eastern and western christianity  enhanced the cultural and religious distinctiveness between eastern and western europe  much of eastern europe was invaded and occupied by the mongols   the conquest of the byzantine empire  center of the eastern orthodox church  by the ottoman empire in the 15th century  and the gradual fragmentation of the holy roman empire  which had replaced the frankish empire  led to a change of the importance of roman catholic protestant vs  eastern orthodox concept in europe  armour points out that the cyrillic alphabet use is not a strict determinant for eastern europe  where from croatia to poland and everywhere in between  the latin alphabet is used  48  greece s status as the cradle of western civilization and an integral part of the western world in the political  cultural and economic spheres has led to it being nearly always classified as belonging not to eastern  but to southern or western europe  49  during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries eastern europe enjoyed a relative high standard of living  this period is also called the east-central european golden age of around 1600.[50   a major result of the first world war was the breakup of the russian  austro-hungarian  and ottoman empires  as well as partial losses to the german empire  a surge of ethnic nationalism created a series of new states in eastern europe  validated by the versailles treaty of 1919  poland was reconstituted after the partitions of the 1790s had divided it between germany  austria  and russia  new countries included finland  estonia  latvia  lithuania  ukraine  which was soon absorbed by the soviet union   czechoslovakia  and yugoslavia  austria and hungary had much reduced boundaries  romania  bulgaria and albania likewise were independent  all the countries were heavily rural  with little industry and only a few urban centers  nationalism was the dominant force but most of the countries had ethnic or religious minorities who felt threatened by majority elements  nearly all became democratic in the 1920s  but all of them  except czechoslovakia and finland  gave up democracy during the depression years of the 1930s  in favor of autocratic or strong-man or single party states  the new states were unable to form stable military alliances  and one by one were too weak to stand up against nazi germany or the soviet union  which took them over between 1938 and 1945   russia  defeated in the first world war  lost territory as the baltics and poland made good their independence  the region was the main battlefield in the second world war (1939\u201345   with german and soviet armies sweeping back and forth  with millions of jews killed by the nazis  and millions of others killed by disease  starvation  and military action  or executed after being deemed as politically dangerous  51  during the final stages of world war ii the future of eastern europe was decided by the overwhelming power of the soviet red army  as it swept the germans aside  it did not reach yugoslavia and albania however  finland was free but forced to be neutral in the upcoming cold war  the region fell to soviet control and communist governments were imposed  yugoslavia and albania had their own communist regimes  the eastern bloc with the onset of the cold war in 1947 was mostly behind the western european countries in economic rebuilding and progress  winston churchill  in his famous  sinews of peace  address of march 5  1946 at westminster college in fulton  missouri  stressed the geopolitical impact of the  iron curtain    from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the continent  behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of central and eastern europe  warsaw  berlin  prague  vienna  budapest  belgrade  bucharest  and sofia   the soviet secret police  the nkvd  working in collaboration with local communists  created secret police forces using leadership trained in moscow  as soon as the red army had expelled the germans  this new secret police arrived to arrest political enemies according to prepared lists  the national communists then took power in a normally gradualist manner  backed by the soviets in many  but not all  cases  they took control of the interior ministries  which controlled the local police  they confiscated and redistributed farmland  next the soviets and their agents took control of the mass media  especially radio  as well as the education system  third the communists seized control of or replaced the organizations of civil society  such as church groups  sports  youth groups  trade unions  farmers organizations  and civic organizations  finally they engaged in large scale ethnic cleansing  moving ethnic minorities far away  often with high loss of life  after a year or two  the communists took control of private businesses and monitored the media and churches  for a while  cooperative non-communist parties were tolerated  the communists had a natural reservoir of popularity in that they had destroyed hitler and the nazi invaders  their goal was to guarantee long-term working-class solidarity  52][53  eastern europe after 1945 usually meant all the european countries liberated and then occupied by the soviet army  it included the german democratic republic  also known as east germany   formed by the soviet occupation zone of germany  all the countries in eastern europe adopted communist modes of control  these countries were officially independent from the soviet union  but the practical extent of this independence \u2013 except in yugoslavia  albania  and to some extent romania \u2013 was quite limited  under pressure from stalin these nations rejected grants from the american marshall plan  instead they participated in the molotov plan which later evolved into the comecon  council for mutual economic assistance   when nato was created in 1949  most countries of eastern europe became members of the opposing warsaw pact  forming a geopolitical concept that became known as the eastern bloc   with the fall of the iron curtain in 1989  the political landscape of the eastern bloc  and indeed the world  changed  in the german reunification  the federal republic of germany peacefully absorbed the german democratic republic in 1990  in 1991  comecon  the warsaw pact  and the soviet union were dissolved  many european nations which had been part of the soviet union regained their independence  belarus  moldova  ukraine  as well as the baltic states of latvia  lithuania  and estonia   czechoslovakia peacefully separated into the czech republic and slovakia in 1993  many countries of this region joined the european union  namely bulgaria  the czech republic  estonia  hungary  latvia  lithuania  poland  romania  and slovakia   european geography   coordinates  50\xb0n 30\xb0e ufeff   \ufeff50\xb0n 30\xb0e ufeff   50  30
