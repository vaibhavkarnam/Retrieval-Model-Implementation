AguC3A7adoraWavePark
 the agu xe7adoura wave farm was the world s first wave farm  it was located 5\xa0km (3\xa0mi  offshore near p xf3voa de varzim north of porto in portugal  the farm was designed to use three pelamis wave energy converters to convert the motion of the ocean surface waves into electricity  totalling to 2.25\xa0mw in total installed capacity  the farm was officially opened on 23 september 2008  by the portuguese minister of economy  1][2  the wave farm was shut down two months after the official opening in november 2008.[3][4       developed by the scottish company pelamis wave power  the pelamis machine is made up of connected sections which flex and bend relative to one another as waves run along the structure  this motion is resisted by hydraulic rams which pump high pressure oil through hydraulic motors which in turn drive electrical generators  the three machines which made up the agu xe7adoura wave park were each rated at a peak output of 750\xa0kw  giving an installed peak capacity of 2.25\xa0mw  enough to meet the average electricity demand of more than 1,500 portuguese homes  5  the average output from a pelamis machine will depend on the wave resource in a particular area  the higher the resource the higher the average output  according to information on the pelamis web site  it appears that the average power output for a pelamis wave machine is about 150\xa0kw  [6   the project was originally conceived by the portuguese renewable energy company enersis  which developed and financed the project and which was subsequently bought by the australian infrastructure company babcock  amp  brown in december 2005  in the last quarter of 2008  babcock  amp  brown had its shares suspended and has been in a managed process of selling its assets  including the agu xe7adoura project  in march 2009  babcock  amp  brown went into voluntary administration  7   in november 2008  the pelamis machines were brought back to harbor at leix xf5es due to a technical problem with some of the bearings for which a solution has been found  however  the machines are likely to remain off-line until a new partner is found to take over babcock  amp  brown u2019s 77  share in the project  this seems unlikely  because according to pelamis  those machines are sub-optimal  and the owner is trying to sell them  4  pelamis subsequently focused its efforts on the new p2 machine  8  which was tested in orkney in scotland beginning in 2010  pelamis ceased operations in 2014;[9  the p2 device was dismantled in 2016.[10
