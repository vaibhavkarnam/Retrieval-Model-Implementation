OneWorldTradeCenter
 one world trade center  also known as 1 world trade center  1 wtc or freedom tower 13   is the main building of the rebuilt world trade center complex in lower manhattan  new york city  it is the tallest building in the western hemisphere  and the sixth-tallest in the world  the supertall structure has the same name as the north tower of the original world trade center  which was completely destroyed in the terrorist attacks of september 11  2001  the new skyscraper stands on the northwest corner of the 16-acre (6.5\xa0ha  world trade center site  on the site of the original 6 world trade center  the building is bounded by west street to the west  vesey street to the north  fulton street to the south  and washington street to the east   the building s architect was david childs  whose firm skidmore  owings  amp  merrill  som  also designed the burj khalifa and the willis tower  the construction of below-ground utility relocations  footings  and foundations for the new building began on april 27  2006  one world trade center became the tallest structure in new york city on april 30  2012  when it surpassed the height of the empire state building  the tower s steel structure was topped out on august 30  2012  on may 10  2013  the final component of the skyscraper s spire was installed  making the building  including its spire  reach a total height of 1,776 feet (541\xa0m   its height in feet is a deliberate reference to the year when the united states declaration of independence was signed  the building opened on november 3  2014   on march 30  2009  the port authority of new york and new jersey  panynj  confirmed that the building would be officially known by its legal name of  one world trade center   rather than its colloquial name of  freedom tower   the building is 104 standard floors high  but the tower has only 94 actual stories   the new world trade center complex will eventually include five high-rise office buildings built along greenwich street  as well as the national september 11 memorial  amp  museum  located just south of one world trade center where the original twin towers stood  the construction of the new building is part of an effort to memorialize and rebuild following the destruction of the original world trade center complex   the construction of the world trade center  of which the twin towers  one and two world trade center  were the centerpieces  was conceived as an urban renewal project and spearheaded by david rockefeller  the project was intended to help revitalize lower manhattan  14  the project was planned by the port authority of new york and new jersey  which hired architect minoru yamasaki  yamasaki came up with the idea of building twin towers  after extensive negotiations  the new jersey and new york state governments  which supervise the port authority  consented to the construction of the world trade center at the radio row site  located in the lower-west area of manhattan  15  to satisfy the new jersey government  the port authority agreed to buy the bankrupt hudson  amp  manhattan railroad  renamed to port authority trans-hudson   which transported commuters from new jersey to lower manhattan  16   the towers were designed as framed tube structures  giving tenants open floor plans  unobstructed by columns or walls  17][18  this design was accomplished by using many closely spaced perimeter columns  providing much of the structure s strength  with the gravity load shared with the core columns  the elevator system  which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators  allowed substantial floor space to be used for office purposes by making the structural core smaller  the design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques  such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation  19][20   construction of the north tower  one world trade center  began in august 1966  extensive use of prefabricated components sped up the construction process  the first tenants moved into the north tower in december 1970.[21][22  in the 1970s  four other low-level buildings were built as part of the world trade center complex  23][24  a seventh building was built in the mid-1980s  25][26   after seven world trade center was built in the 1980s  the world trade center complex had a total of seven buildings  however  the most notable ones were the main twin towers built in the 1970s u2014one world trade center was the north tower  and two world trade center was the south tower  27  each tower was over 1,350 feet (410\xa0m  high  and occupied about 1 acre (0.40\xa0ha  of the total 16 acres (6.5\xa0ha  of the site s land  during a press conference in 1973  yamasaki was asked   why two 110-story buildings  why not one 220-story building   his response was   i didn t want to lose the human scale   28   when completed in 1972  one world trade center became the tallest building in the world for two years  surpassing the empire state building  which had held the record for 40 years  the north tower was 1,368 feet (417\xa0m  tall  and in 1978  a telecommunications antenna was added to the top of the roof  by itself  the antenna was 360 feet (110\xa0m  tall  with the 360-foot (110\xa0m -tall antenna  the highest point of the north tower reached 1,728\xa0ft (527\xa0m   29  the tower held its record for a brief period of time  chicago s sears tower  finished in may 1973  was 1,450 feet (440\xa0m  at the rooftop  30  at 110 floors  the world trade center towers had more floors than any other building at that time  29  this number was not surpassed until the construction of the burj khalifa (163 floors   which opened in 2010.[31][32   of the 110 stories  eight were set aside as mechanical floors  floors 7/8  41/42  75/76  and 108/109   which were four two-floor areas that were spaced up the building in even intervals  all the remaining floors were open for tenants  each floor of the tower had 40,000 square feet (3,700\xa0m2  of available space  33  the north and south tower had 3,800,000 square feet (350,000\xa0m2  of total office space  33  the entire complex of seven buildings had a combined total of 13,400,000 square feet (1,240,000\xa0m2  of office space  23][24][34   the complex initially failed to attract the expected clientele  during the early years  various governmental organizations became key tenants of the world trade center  such as the state of new york  in the 1980s  the city s perilous financial condition eased  after which an increasing number of private companies u2014mostly financial firms related to wall street u2014became tenants  during the 1990s  approximately 500 companies had offices in the complex  including financial companies such as morgan stanley  aon corporation  and salomon brothers  the basement concourse of the world trade center included the mall at the world trade center  35  and a path station  36  the north tower became the main corporate headquarters of cantor fitzgerald  37  and it also became the headquarters of the port authority of new york and new jersey  38   the tower s electrical service was supplied by consolidated edison  coned  at 13,800\xa0volts  the electricity passed through the world trade center primary distribution center  pdc   and was then sent up the building s core to electrical substations located on the mechanical floors  the substations lowered the 13,800 primary voltage to 480/277\xa0volts  and the voltage was then further lowered to 208/120\xa0volts for general power and lighting services  the complex was also served by emergency generators located in the sub-levels of the towers and on the roof of five world trade center  39][40   the 110th floor of one world trade center  the north tower  housed radio and television transmission equipment  the roof of the north tower contained a vast array of transmission antennas  including the 360 feet (110\xa0m  center antenna mast  rebuilt by dielectric inc  to support dtv in 1999.[41  the center mast contained the television signals for almost all nyc television broadcasters  wcbs-tv xa02  wnbc-tv xa04  wnyw xa05  wabc-tv xa07  wwor-tv xa09 secaucus  wpix xa011  wnet xa013 newark  wpxn-tv xa031 and wnju xa047 linden  41  it also had four nyc fm broadcasters  wpat-fm xa093.1  wnyc xa093.9  wkcr xa089.9  and wktu xa0103.5.[41  access to the roof was controlled by the wtc operations control center  occ   located in the b1 level of the south tower  41  after the september 11 attacks of 2001  the broadcasting equipment for the radio and television stations was moved to the empire state building  42   on a typical weekday  a combined total of 50,000 people worked in the north and south towers  43  with another 200,000 passing through as visitors  44  the complex was so large that it had its own zip code  10048.[45  the windows on the world restaurant  located on top of the north tower  reported revenues of $37 million in 2000  making it the highest-grossing restaurant in the united states  46  the twin towers became known worldwide  appearing in movies  television shows  postcards  and other merchandise  the towers came to be seen as a new york city icon  much like the empire state building  the chrysler building  and the statue of liberty  47   on february 13  1975  a three-alarm fire broke out on the 11th floor of the north tower  fire spread through the core of the building to the 9th and 14th floors  as the insulation for telephone cables  located in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors  had been ignited  areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately  and the original fire was put out in a few hours  48  most of the damage was on the 11th floor  where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper  alcohol-based fluid for office machines  and other office equipment  fireproofing protected the steel  49  and there was no structural damage to the tower  48  in addition to the fire damage on the 9th and 14th floors  water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few floors below  at the time  the world trade center complex had no fire sprinkler systems  48   the first terrorist attack on the world trade center occurred on february 26  1993  at 12:17\xa0p m   when a ryder truck filled with 1,500 pounds (680\xa0kg  of explosives  planted by ramzi yousef  detonated in the underground garage of the north tower  50  the blast resulted in a 100 feet (30\xa0m  hole through five sublevels  the greatest damage was on levels b1 and b2  with significant structural damage on level b3.[51  six people were killed  and more than a thousand were injured  as 50,000 workers and visitors were inside the tower at the time  many people inside the north tower were forced to walk down darkened stairwells that had no emergency lighting  and some took two hours or more to reach safety  52][53   at 8:46\xa0a m   edt  on september 11  2001  five hijackers affiliated with al-qaeda crashed american airlines flight 11 into the northern facade of the north tower  54][55  seventeen minutes later  at 9:03\xa0a m   edt   a second group of terrorists crashed the hijacked united airlines flight 175 into the southern facade of the south tower  striking between the 77th and 85th floors  56   by 9:59\xa0a m   edt   the south tower collapsed after burning for approximately 56 minutes  after burning for 102\xa0minutes  the north tower collapsed due to structural failure at 10:28\xa0a m  (edt  57  when the north tower collapsed  debris fell on the nearby 7 world trade center  damaging it and starting fires  the fires burned for hours  compromising the building s structural integrity  seven world trade center collapsed at 5:21\xa0p m  (edt  58][59   together with a simultaneous attack on the pentagon in arlington  virginia  and a failed plane hijacking that resulted in a plane crash in shanksville  pennsylvania  the attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people (2,507 civilians  343 firefighters  72 law enforcement officers  55 military personnel  and the 19 hijackers   60][61][62  more than 90  of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact  63  in the north tower  1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped  and died of smoke inhalation  fell  jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames  or were killed when the building eventually collapsed  one stairwell in the south tower  stairwell a  somehow avoided complete destruction  unlike the rest of the building  64  when flight 11 hit  all three staircases in the north tower above the impact zone were destroyed  thus making it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape  107 people below the point of impact also died  63   following the destruction of the original world trade center  there was debate regarding the future of the world trade center site  there were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately  and by 2002  the lower manhattan development corporation had organized a competition to determine how to use the site  65  the proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the september 11 attacks and rebuild the complex  66][67  when the public rejected the first round of designs  a second  more open competition took place in december 2002  in which a design by daniel libeskind was selected as the winner  this design went through many revisions  mainly because of disagreements with developer larry silverstein  who held the lease to the world trade center site at that time  68   there was criticism concerning the limited number of floors that were designated for office space and other amenities in an early plan  only 82 floors would have been habitable  and the total office space of the rebuilt world trade center complex would have been reduced by more than 3,000,000 square feet (280,000\xa0m2  in comparison with the original complex  5  the floor limit was imposed by silverstein  who expressed concern that higher floors would be a liability in the event of a future terrorist attack or other incident  much of the building s height would have consisted of a large  open-air steel lattice structure on the roof of the tower  containing wind turbines and  sky gardens   5  in a subsequent design  the highest occupiable floor became comparable to the original world trade center  and the open-air lattice was removed from the plans  5  in 2002  former new york governor george pataki faced accusations of cronyism for supposedly using his influence to get the winning architect s design picked as a personal favor for his friend and campaign contributor  ron lauder  69   a final design for the  freedom tower  was formally unveiled on june 28  2005  to address security issues raised by the new york city police department  a 187-foot (57\xa0m  concrete base was added to the design in april of that year  the design originally included plans to clad the base in glass prisms in order to address criticism that the building might have looked uninviting and resembled a  concrete bunker   however  the prisms were later found to be unworkable  as preliminary testing revealed that the prismatic glass easily shattered into large and dangerous shards  as a result  it was replaced by a simpler facade consisting of stainless steel panels and blast-resistant glass  70   contrasting with libeskind s original plan  the tower s final design tapers octagonally as it rises  its designers stated that the tower would be a  monolithic glass structure reflecting the sky and topped by a sculpted antenna   in 2006  larry silverstein commented on a planned completion date   by 2012 we should have a completely rebuilt world trade center  more magnificent  more spectacular than it ever was   71  on april 26  2006  the port authority of new york and new jersey approved a conceptual framework that allowed foundation construction to begin  a formal agreement was drafted the following day  the 75th anniversary of the 1931 opening of the empire state building  construction began in may  a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place when the first construction team arrived  72   the symbolic cornerstone of one world trade center was laid in a ceremony on july 4  2004.[73  the stone had an inscription supposedly written by arthur j  finkelstein  74  however  construction was delayed until 2006 due to disputes over money  security  and design  73  the last major issues were resolved on april 26  2006  when a deal was made between developer larry silverstein and the port authority of new york and new jersey  so the cornerstone was temporarily removed from the site on june 23  2006.[75  soon after  explosives were detonated at the construction site for two months to clear bedrock for the building s foundation  onto which 400 cubic yards (310 cubic meters  of concrete was poured by november 2007.[76   in a december 18  2006  ceremony held in nearby battery park city  members of the public were invited to sign the first 30-foot (9.1\xa0m  steel beam installed onto the building s base  77][78  it was welded onto the building s base on december 19  2006.[79  foundation and steel installation began shortly afterward  so the tower s footings and foundation were nearly complete within a year  80   in january 2008  two cranes were moved onto the site  construction of the tower s concrete core  which began after the cranes arrived  80  reached street level by may 17  however  construction of the base was not finished until two years later  after which construction of the office floors began  and the first glass windows were subsequently installed  during 2010  floors were constructed at a rate of about one per week  81  an advanced  cocoon  scaffolding system was installed to protect workers from falling  and was the first such safety system installed on a steel structure in the city  82  the tower reached 52 floors and was over 600 feet (180\xa0m  tall by december 2010  the tower s steel frame was halfway complete by then  83  but grew to 82 floors by the tenth anniversary of the september 11 attacks  at which time its concrete flooring had reached 72 floors and the glass cladding had reached 56 floors  84   in 2009  the port authority changed the official name of the building from  freedom tower  to  one world trade center   stating that this name was the  easiest for people to identify with   1][85  the change came after board members of the port authority voted to sign a 21-year lease deal with vantone industrial co   a chinese real estate company  which will become the building s first commercial tenant  vantone plans to create the china center  a trade and cultural facility  covering 191,000 square feet on floors 64 through 69.[86   detailed floor plans of the tower were posted on the new york city s department of finance website in may 2011  resulting in an uproar from the media and citizens of the surrounding area  who warned that the plans could potentially be used for a future terrorist attack  87   while under construction  the tower was specially illuminated on several occasions  88  on the weekend of july 4  2011  it was lit up with the colors of the american flag to commemorate independence day  and it was lit up with the same colors on september 11 to mark the 10th anniversary of the september 11 terrorist attacks  89  on october 27 of that same year  it was illuminated with pink in honor of breast cancer awareness month  88  on december 11  the port authority illuminated the tower with multicolored lights to celebrate the holiday season  88  on february 24  2012  the building was lit up with red in honor of archbishop of new york timothy dolan  who became a cardinal on february 18.[88  on june 14  2012  it was illuminated with red  white  and blue to honor flag day  88  in august  it was illuminated with red in honor of the armed forces  88  on september 8  2012  it was once again illuminated with red  white  and blue to honor the 11th anniversary of the september 11 attacks  90  on june 24  2013  the building was again illuminated with red  white  and blue to celebrate the fourth of july  88  on november 12  2013  three hundred red  white  and blue lights were lit up  91   the tower s loading dock  however  was not due to be finished in time to move equipment into the completed building  so five temporary loading bays were added at a cost of millions of dollars  the temporary path station was not to be removed until its official replacement  the world trade center transportation hub  was completed  blocking access to the planned loading area  92  by march 2012  one world trade center s steel structure had reached 93 floors  93  growing to 94 floors and 1,240 feet (380\xa0m  by the end of the month  94  however  because the floor numberings were based on standard measurements  the 94th floor was numbered  floor 100   because the extra space was occupied by the high-ceilinged 91st floor  which was used for mechanical purposes  94   the still-incomplete tower became new york city s tallest building by roof height in april 2012  passing the 1,250-foot (380\xa0m  roof height of the empire state building  95][96  president barack obama visited the construction site two months later and wrote  on a steel beam that would be hoisted to the top of the tower  the sentence  we remember  we rebuild  we come back stronger   97  that same month  with the tower s structure nearing completion  the owners of the building began a public marketing campaign for the building  seeking to attract visitors and tenants  98   one world trade center s steel structure topped out at the nominal 104th floor  with a total height of 1,368 feet (417\xa0m   in august 2012.[70][99  the tower s antenna was shipped to new york in november 2012;[100  the first section of the antenna was hoisted to the top of the tower on december 12  2012,[101  and was installed on january 15  2013.[102  by march 2013  two sections of the antenna had been installed  the spire s completion was scheduled for april 29  2013  but bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces  103  on may 10  2013  the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of one world trade center  bringing the tower to its full height of 1,776 feet (541\xa0m   and making it the fourth-tallest building in the world  as well as the tallest in the city  surpassing the 1,454-foot (443\xa0m  empire state building  70][104  in subsequent months  the exterior elevator shaft was removed  the podium glass  interior decorations  and other finishings were being installed  and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed  93   a report in september 2013 revealed that  at the time of the report  the world trade center association  wtca  was negotiating with regard to the  world trade center  name  as the wtca had purchased the rights to the name in 1986  the wtca sought $500,000 worth of free office space in the tower in exchange for the use of  world trade center  in the tower s name and associated souvenirs  105   on november 12  2013  the height committee of the chicago-based council on tall buildings and urban habitat  ctbuh  made the controversial 106  announcement that one world trade center was the tallest building in the united states at 1,776 feet  declaring that the mast on top of the building is a spire since it is a permanent part of the building s architecture  107][108  by the same reasoning  the building was also the tallest in the western hemisphere  109   the original twin towers  c  u20092000  one world trade center under construction behind the world financial center in june 2011  one world trade center under construction  to the left   as seen from a helicopter on april 30  2012  on november 1  2014  moving trucks started moving items for the tower s first tenant  magazine publisher cond xe9 nast  from its old headquarters in times square to one world trade center  the new york times noted that the area around the world trade center had transitioned from a financial area to one with technology firms  residences  and luxury shops  coincident with the building of the new tower  110   the building opened on november 3  2014  and cond xe9 nast employees moved into spaces spread among 24 floors  111][112][113][114  cond xe9 nast occupies floors 20 to 44  having completed its move in early 2015.[110  it is expected that the company will attract new tenants to occupy the remaining 40  of unleased space in the tower  110  as cond xe9 nast had revitalized times square after moving there in 1999.[115  only about 170 of 3,400 total employees moved into the new tower on the first day  future tenants will include kids creative  legends hospitality  the bmb group  servcorp  116  and gq  115    on november 12  2014  the supporting wire rope cables of a suspended working platform slacked  the cables were manufactured by tractel  and they were used to hold workers who performed maintenance on the building s exterior  at the time  the platform was holding a two-man  seiu-affiliated window washing team  the slack caused the platform to hang almost vertically near the 68th floor of the tower  the workers were rescued by over 100 fdny firefighters  who used a diamond saw to cut through the glass  after the incident  the workers suffered from a slight case of hypothermia  and were taken to the hospital  117][118][119   an estimate in february 2007 placed the initial construction cost of one world trade center at about $3 billion  or $1,150 per square foot ($12,380 per square meter   120  however  the tower s total estimated construction cost had risen to $3.9 billion by april 2012  making it the most expensive building in the world at the time  2][3  the tower s construction was partly funded by approximately $1\xa0billion of insurance money that silverstein received for his losses in the september 11 attacks  120  the state of new york provided an additional $250\xa0million  and the port authority agreed to give $1\xa0billion  which would be obtained through the sale of bonds  121  the port authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds  with a 56\xa0percent toll increase scheduled between 2011 and 2015  however  the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the tower s construction  3][122   many of daniel libeskind s original concepts from the 2002 competition were discarded from the tower s final design  one world trade center s final design consisted of simple symmetries and a more traditional profile  intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary new york skyline  the tower s central spire draws from previous buildings  such as the empire state building and the chrysler building  it also visually resembles the original twin towers  rather than being an off-center spire similar to the statue of liberty  123][124][125][126][127   the building occupies a 200-foot (61\xa0m  square  with an area of 40,000 square feet (3,700\xa0m2   nearly identical to the footprints of the original twin towers  the tower is built upon a 185-foot (56\xa0m  tall windowless concrete base  designed to protect it from truck bombs and other ground-level attacks  128  originally  the base was to be covered in decorative prismatic glass  but a simpler glass-and-steel fa xe7ade was adopted when the prisms proved unworkable  70  the current base cladding consists of angled glass fins protruding from stainless steel panels  similar to those on 7 world trade center  led lights behind the panels illuminate the base at night  129  cable-net glass fa xe7ades on all four sides of the building for the higher floors  designed by schlaich bergermann  will be consistent with the other buildings in the complex  the fa xe7ades are 60 feet (18\xa0m  high  and range in width from 30 feet (9.1\xa0m  on the east and west sides  50 feet (15\xa0m  on the north side  and 70 feet (21\xa0m  on the south side  11  the curtain wall was manufactured and assembled by benson industries in portland  oregon  using glass made in minnesota by viracon  130   from the 20th floor upwards  the square edges of the tower s cubic base are chamfered back  shaping the building into eight tall isosceles triangles  or an elongated square antiprism  131  near its middle  the tower forms a perfect octagon  and then culminates in a glass parapet  whose shape is a square oriented 45 degrees from the base  a 408-foot (124 m  sculpted mast containing the broadcasting antenna xa0\u2013 designed in a collaboration

(300\xa0m  above the tower  132   david childs of som  the architect of one world trade center  said the following regarding the tower s design  133   we really wanted our design to be grounded in something that was very real  not just in sculptural sketches  we explored the infrastructural challenges because the proper solution would have to be compelling  not just beautiful  the design does have great sculptural implications  and we fully understand the iconic importance of the tower  but it also has to be a highly efficient building  the discourse about freedom tower has often been limited to the symbolic  formal and aesthetic aspects but we recognize that if this building doesn t function well  if people don t want to work and visit there  then we will have failed as architects  133   just south of the new one world trade center is the national september 11 memorial  amp  museum  which is located where the original twin towers stood  immediately to the east is world trade

exposed antenna and equipment is unfortunate   we stand ready to work with the port on an alternate design   125  after joining the project in 2010  the durst organization had suggested eliminating the radome to reduce costs  but the proposal was rejected by the port authority s then-executive director  christopher o  ward  125  ward was replaced by patrick foye in september 2011.[124  foye

insurance dispute regarding the tower  the terms of the lease agreement signed in 2001  for which silverstein paid $14 million  233  gave silverstein  as leaseholder  the right and obligation to rebuild the structures if they were destroyed  234  after the september 11 attacks  there were a series of disputes between silverstein and insurance companies concerning the insurance policies that covered the original towers  this resulted in the construction of one world trade center being delayed  after a trial resulted  a verdict was given on april 29  2004  the verdict was that ten of the insurers involved in the dispute were subject to the  one occurrence  interpretation  so their liability was limited to the face value of those policies  three insurers were added to the second trial
