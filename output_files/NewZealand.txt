two main landmasses u2014the north island  or te ika-a-m u0101ui  and the south island  or te waipounamu u2014and around 600 smaller islands  new zealand is situated some 1,500 kilometres (900\xa0mi  east of australia across the tasman sea and roughly 1,000 kilometres (600\xa0mi  south of the pacific island areas of new caledonia  fiji  and tonga  because of its remoteness  it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans  during its long period of isolation  new zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal  fungal and plant life  the country s varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks  such as the southern alps  owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions  new zealand s capital city is wellington  while its most populous city is auckland   sometime between 1250 and 1300 ce  polynesians settled in the islands that later were named new zealand and developed a distinctive m u0101ori culture  in 1642  dutch explorer abel tasman became the first european to sight new zealand  12  in 1840  representatives of britain and m u0101ori chiefs signed the treaty of waitangi  which declared british sovereignty over the islands  in 1841  new zealand became a colony within the british empire and in 1907 it became a dominion  today  the majority of new zealand s population of 4.7 million is of european descent  the indigenous m u0101ori are the largest minority  followed by asians and pacific islanders  reflecting this  new zealand s culture is mainly derived from m u0101ori and early british settlers  with recent broadening arising from increased immigration  the official languages are english  m u0101ori and new zealand sign language  with english predominant   new zealand is a developed country and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance  such as health  education  economic freedom and quality of life  since the 1980s  new zealand has transformed from an agrarian  regulated economy to a market economy  nationally  legislative authority is vested in an elected  unicameral parliament  while executive political power is exercised by the cabinet  led by the prime minister  who is currently bill english  queen elizabeth ii is the country s head of state and is represented by a governor-general  in addition  new zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes  the realm of new zealand also includes tokelau  a dependent territory   the cook islands and niue  self-governing states in free association with new zealand   and the ross dependency  which is new zealand s territorial claim in antarctica  new zealand is a member of the united nations  commonwealth of nations  anzus  organisation for economic co-operation and development  pacific islands forum  and asia-pacific economic cooperation   dutch explorer abel tasman sighted new zealand in 1642 and called it staten landt  supposing it was connected to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of south america  13  in 1645  dutch cartographers renamed the land nova zeelandia after the dutch province of zeeland  14][15  british explorer james cook subsequently anglicised the name to new zealand  16][17   aotearoa  often translated as  land of the long white cloud   18  is the current m u0101ori name for new zealand  it is unknown whether m u0101ori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of europeans  with aotearoa originally referring to just the north island  19  m u0101ori had several traditional names for the two main islands  including te ika-a-m u0101ui  the fish of m u0101ui  for the north island and te waipounamu  the waters of greenstone  or te waka o aoraki  the canoe of aoraki  for the south island  20  early european maps labelled the islands north  north island   middle  south island  and south  stewart island   rakiura   21  in 1830  maps began to use north and south to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907  this was the accepted norm  17  the new zealand geographic board discovered in 2009 that the names of the north island and south island had never been formalised  and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013  this set the names as north island or te ika-a-m u0101ui  and south island or te waipounamu  22  for each island  either its english or m u0101ori name can be used  or both can be used together  22   new zealand was one of the last major landmasses settled by humans  radiocarbon dating  evidence of deforestation 24  and mitochondrial dna variability within m u0101ori populations 25  suggest new zealand was first settled by eastern polynesians between 1250 and 1300,[20][26  concluding a long series of voyages through the southern pacific islands  27  over the centuries that followed  these settlers developed a distinct culture now known as m u0101ori  the population was divided into iwi  tribes  and hap u016b  subtribes  who would sometimes cooperate  sometimes compete and sometimes fight against each other  at some point  a group of m u0101ori migrated to the chatham islands  which they named r u0113kohu  where they developed their distinct moriori culture  28][29  the moriori population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862  largely because of taranaki m u0101ori invasion and enslavement in the 1830s  although european diseases also contributed  in 1862  only 101 survived and the last known full-blooded moriori died in 1933.[30   the first europeans known to have reached new zealand were dutch explorer abel tasman and his crew in 1642.[31  in a hostile encounter  four crew members were killed and at least one m u0101ori was hit by canister shot  32  europeans did not revisit new zealand until 1769 when british explorer james cook mapped almost the entire coastline  31  following cook  new zealand was visited by numerous european and north american whaling  sealing and trading ships  they traded european food  metal tools  weapons and other goods for timber  m u0101ori food  artefacts and water  33  the introduction of the potato and the musket transformed m u0101ori agriculture and warfare  potatoes provided a reliable food surplus  which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns  34  the resulting intertribal musket wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840  killing 30,000\u201340,000 m u0101ori  35  from the early 19th century  christian missionaries began to settle new zealand  eventually converting most of the m u0101ori population  36  the m u0101ori population declined to around 40  of its pre-contact level during the 19th century  introduced diseases were the major factor  37   in 1788 captain arthur phillip assumed the position of governor of the new british colony of new south wales which according to his commission included new zealand  38  the british government appointed james busby as british resident to new zealand in 1832 following a petition from northern m u0101ori  39  in 1835  following an announcement of impending french settlement by charles de thierry  the nebulous united tribes of new zealand sent a declaration of the independence to king william iv of the united kingdom asking for protection  39  ongoing unrest  the proposed settlement of new zealand by the new zealand company  which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from m u0101ori  and the dubious legal standing of the declaration of independence prompted the colonial office to send captain william hobson to claim sovereignty for great britain and negotiate a treaty with the m u0101ori  40  the treaty of waitangi was first signed in the bay of islands on 6 february 1840.[41  in response to the new zealand company s attempts to establish an independent settlement in wellington 42  and french settlers purchasing land in akaroa  43  hobson declared british sovereignty over all of new zealand on 21 may 1840  even though copies of the treaty were still circulating throughout the country for m u0101ori to sign  44  with the signing of the treaty and declaration of sovereignty the number of immigrants  particularly from the united kingdom  began to increase  45   new zealand  still part of the colony of new south wales  became a separate colony of new zealand on 1 july 1841.[46  the colony gained a representative government in 1852 and the first parliament met in 1854.[47  in 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing  gaining responsibility over all domestic matters other than native policy  47   control over native policy was granted in the mid-1860s   47  following concerns that the south island might form a separate colony  premier alfred domett moved a resolution to transfer the capital from auckland to a locality near the cook strait  48  wellington was chosen for its harbour and central location  with parliament officially sitting there for the first time in 1865  as immigrant numbers increased  conflicts over land led to the new zealand wars of the 1860s and 1870s  resulting in the loss and confiscation of much m u0101ori land  49   in 1891 the liberal party led by john ballance came to power as the first organised political party  the liberal government  later led by richard seddon  passed many important social and economic measures  in 1893 new zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all women the right to vote 50  and in 1894 pioneered the adoption of compulsory arbitration between employers and unions  51  in 1898 seddon s government passed the old-age pensions act of 1898  the first general pensions scheme in the british empire   in 1907  at the request of the new zealand parliament  king edward vii proclaimed new zealand a dominion within the british empire  reflecting its self-governing status  accordingly  the title  dominion of new zealand  dates from 1907.[52][53  in 1947 the country adopted the statute of westminster  confirming that the british parliament could no longer legislate for new zealand without the consent of new zealand  47   early in the 20th century  new zealand was involved in world affairs  fighting in the first and second world wars 54  and suffering through the great depression  55  the depression led to the election of the first labour government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy  56  new zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the second world war 57  and m u0101ori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work  58  a m u0101ori protest movement developed  which criticised eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of m u0101ori culture and of the treaty of waitangi  59  in 1975  a waitangi tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the treaty  and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985.[41  the government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi  although m u0101ori claims to the foreshore and seabed have proved controversial in the 2000s   new zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy  60  although its constitution is not codified  61  elizabeth ii is the queen of new zealand and the head of state  62  the queen is represented by the governor-general  whom she appoints on the advice of the prime minister  63][64  the governor-general can exercise the crown s prerogative powers  such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers  ambassadors and other key public officials  65  and in rare situations  the reserve powers  e g  the power to dissolve parliament or refuse the royal assent of a bill into law   66  the powers of the queen and the governor-general are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers  66   the new zealand parliament holds legislative power and consists of the queen and the house of representatives  67  it also included an upper house  the legislative council  until this was abolished in 1950.[67  the supremacy of parliament  over the crown and other government institutions  was established in england by the bill of rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in new zealand  67  the house of representatives is democratically elected and a government is formed from the party or coalition with the majority of seats  if no majority is formed  a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured  67  the governor-general appoints ministers under advice from the prime minister  who is by convention the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition  68  cabinet  formed by ministers and led by the prime minister  is the highest policy-making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions  69  members of cabinet make major decisions collectively  and are therefore collectively responsible for the consequences of these decisions  70   almost all parliamentary general elections between 1853 and 1993 were held under the first-past-the-post voting system  71  since the 1996 election  a form of proportional representation called mixed member proportional  mmp  has been used  61  under the mmp system  each person has two votes  one is for electorate seats  including some reserved for m u0101ori   72  and the other is for a party  since the 2014 election  there have been 71 electorates  which includes 7 m u0101ori electorates   and the remaining 49 seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote  although a party has to win one electorate or 5  of the total party vote before it is eligible for these seats  73   elections since the 1930s have been dominated by two political parties  national and labour  71  between march 2005 and august 2006  new zealand became the only country in the world in which all the highest offices in the land u2014head of state  governor-general  prime minister  speaker and chief justice u2014were occupied simultaneously by women  74  the current prime minister is bill english  since december 2016  his national government won a third term in office following the 2014 election  75   new zealand s judiciary  headed by the chief justice  76  includes the supreme court  court of appeal  the high court  and subordinate courts  61  judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence  61  this theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by parliament without other influences on their decisions  77   new zealand is identified as one of the world s most stable and well-governed states  78][79  with high government transparency and among the lowest perceived levels of corruption  80  the country rates highly for civic participation in the political process  with 77  voter turnout during the most recent elections  compared to an oecd average of 68%.[81   early colonial new zealand allowed the british government to determine external trade and be responsible for foreign policy  82  the 1923 and 1926 imperial conferences decided that new zealand should be allowed to negotiate their own political treaties and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with japan  on 3 september 1939 new zealand allied itself with britain and declared war on germany with prime minister michael savage proclaiming   where she goes  we go  where she stands  we stand   83   in 1951 the united kingdom became increasingly focused on its european interests  84  while new zealand joined australia and the united states in the anzus security treaty  85  the influence of the united states on new zealand weakened following protests over the vietnam war  86  the refusal of the united states to admonish france after the sinking of the rainbow warrior  87  disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues and new zealand s nuclear-free policy  88][89  despite the united states  suspension of anzus obligations the treaty remained in effect between new zealand and australia  whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend  90  close political contact is maintained between the two countries  with free trade agreements and travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit  live and work in both countries without restrictions  91  in 2013 update  there were about 650,000 new zealand citizens living in australia  which is equivalent to 15  of the population of new zealand  92   new zealand has a strong presence among the pacific island countries  a large proportion of new zealand s aid goes to these countries and many pacific people migrate to new zealand for employment  93  permanent migration is regulated under the 1970 samoan quota scheme and the 2002 pacific access category  which allow up to 1,100 samoan nationals and up to 750 other pacific islanders respectively to become permanent new zealand residents each year  a seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was introduced in 2007 and in 2009 about 8,000 pacific islanders were employed under it  94  new zealand is involved in the pacific islands forum  asia-pacific economic cooperation and the association of southeast asian nations regional forum  including the east asia summit   91  new zealand is a member of the united nations  95  the commonwealth of nations 96  and the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd   97  and participates in the five power defence arrangements  98   the new zealand defence force consists of three services  the new zealand army  the royal new zealand air force  and the royal new zealand navy  99  new zealand s national defence needs are modest because of the unlikelihood of direct attack  100  although it does have a global presence  the country fought in both world wars  with notable campaigns in gallipoli  crete  101  el alamein 102  and cassino  103  the gallipoli campaign played an important part in fostering new zealand s national identity 104][105  and strengthened the anzac tradition it shares with australia  106   in addition to vietnam and the two world wars  new zealand fought in the second boer war  107  the korean war  108  the malayan emergency  109  the gulf war and the afghanistan war  it has contributed forces to several regional and global peacekeeping missions  such as those in cyprus  somalia  bosnia and herzegovina  the sinai  angola  cambodia  the iran u2013iraq border  bougainville  east timor  and the solomon islands  110   new zealand ranks eighth in the center for global development s 2015 commitment to development index  which ranks the world s most developed countries on their dedication to policies that benefit poorer nations  111  new zealand is considered the fourth most peaceful country in the world according to the 2016 global peace index  112   the early european settlers divided new zealand into provinces  which had a degree of autonomy  113  because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways  education  land sales and other policies  government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876.[114  the provinces are remembered in regional public holidays 115  and sporting rivalries  116   since 1876  various councils have administered local areas under legislation determined by the central government  113][117  in 1989  the government reorganised local government into the current two-tier structure of regional councils and territorial authorities  118  the 249 municipalities 118  that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 territorial authorities and 11 regional councils  119  the regional councils  role is to regulate  the natural environment with particular emphasis on resource management   118  while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage  water  local roads  building consents and other local matters  120][121  five of the territorial councils are unitary authorities and also act as regional councils  121  the territorial authorities consist of 13 city councils  53 district councils  and the chatham islands council  while officially the chatham islands council is not a unitary authority  it undertakes many functions of a regional council  122   new zealand is one of 16 realms within the commonwealth  123][60  the realm of new zealand is the entire area over which the queen of new zealand is sovereign  and comprises new zealand  tokelau  the ross dependency  the cook islands and niue  60  the cook islands and niue are self-governing states in free association with new zealand  124][125  the new zealand parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries  but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence  tokelau is a non-self-governing territory  but is administered by a council of three elders  one from each tokelauan atoll   126  the ross dependency is new zealand s territorial claim in antarctica  where it operates the scott base research facility  127  new zealand citizenship law treats all parts of the realm equally  so most people born in new zealand  the cook islands  niue  tokelau and the ross dependency before 2006 are new zealand citizens  further conditions apply for those born from 2006 onwards  128   new zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made up of two main islands and a number of smaller islands  the two main islands  the north island  or te ika-a-m u0101ui  and the south island  or te waipounamu  are separated by the cook strait  22 kilometres (14\xa0mi  wide at its narrowest point  129  besides the north and south islands  the five largest inhabited islands are stewart island  the chatham islands  great barrier island  in the hauraki gulf   130  d urville island  in the marlborough sounds  131  and waiheke island  about 22\xa0km (14\xa0mi  from central auckland   132  the country s islands lie between latitudes 29\xb0 and 53\xb0s  and longitudes 165\xb0 and 179\xb0e   new zealand is long and narrow  over 1,600 kilometres (990\xa0mi  along its north-north-east axis with a maximum width of 400 kilometres (250\xa0mi    133  with about 15,000\xa0km (9,300\xa0mi  of coastline 134  and a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres (103,500\xa0sq xa0mi   135  because of its far-flung outlying islands and long coastline  the country has extensive marine resources  its exclusive economic zone is one of the largest in the world  covering more than 15 times its land area  136   the south island is the largest landmass of new zealand and is the 12th largest island in the world  it is divided along its length by the southern alps  137  there are 18 peaks over 3,000 metres (9,800\xa0ft   the highest of which is aoraki   mount cook at 3,754 metres (12,316\xa0ft   138  fiordland s steep mountains and deep fiords record the extensive ice age glaciation of this south-western corner of the south island  139  the north island is the 14th largest island in the world and is less mountainous but is marked by volcanism  140  the highly active taupo volcanic zone has formed a large volcanic plateau  punctuated by the north island s highest mountain  mount ruapehu (2,797 metres (9,177\xa0ft    the plateau also hosts the country s largest lake  lake taupo  141  nestled in the caldera of one of the world s most active supervolcanoes  142   the country owes its varied topography  and perhaps even its emergence above the waves  to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the pacific and indo-australian plates  143  new zealand is part of zealandia  a microcontinent nearly half the size of australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the gondwanan supercontinent  144  about 25 million years ago  a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region  this is now most evident in the southern alps  formed by compression of the crust beside the alpine fault  elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other  producing the puysegur trench to the south  the hikurangi trench east of the north island  and the kermadec and tonga trenches 145  further north  143   new zealand is part of australasia and oceania  the term oceania is often used to denote the region encompassing the australian continent  new zealand and various islands in the

warmer in february  but the south island cities are warmest in january   new zealand s geographic isolation for 80 million years 154  and island biogeography has influenced evolution of the country s species of animals  fungi and plants  physical isolation has not caused biological isolation  and this has resulted in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species  155][156  about 82  of new zealand s indigenous vascular plants are endemic  covering 1,944 species across 65 genera and includes a single endemic family  157][158  the number of fungi recorded from new zealand  including lichen-forming species  is not known  nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic  but one estimate suggests there are about 2,300 species of lichen-forming fungi in new zealand 157  and 40  of these are endemic  159  the two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps  or by southern beech in cooler climates  160  the remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands  the majority of which are tussock  161   before the arrival of humans an estimated 80  of the land was covered in forest  with only high alpine  wet  infertile and volcanic areas without trees  162  massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived  with around half the forest cover lost to fire after polynesian settlement  163  much of the remaining forest fell after european settlement  being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral farming  leaving forest occupying only 23  of the land  164   the forests were dominated by birds  and the lack of mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi  kakapo  weka and takah u0113 evolving flightlessness  165  the arrival of humans  associated changes to habitat  and the introduction of rats  ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species  including large birds like the moa and haast s eagle  166][167   other indigenous animals are represented by reptiles  tuataras  skinks and geckos   168  frogs  spiders  katipo   insects  weta  and snails  169][170  some  such as the wrens and tuatara  are so unique that they have been called living fossils  three species of bats  one since extinct  were the only sign of native land mammals in new zealand until the 2006 discovery of bones from a unique  mouse-sized land mammal at least 16 million years old  171][172  marine mammals however are abundant  with almost half the world s cetaceans  whales  dolphins  and porpoises  and large numbers of fur seals reported in new zealand waters  173  many seabirds breed in new zealand  a third of them unique to the country  174  more penguin species are found in new zealand than in any other country  175   since human arrival almost half of the country s vertebrate species have become extinct  including at least fifty-one birds  three frogs  three lizards  one freshwater fish  and one bat  others are endangered or have had their range severely reduced  166  however  new zealand conservationists have pioneered several methods to help threatened wildlife recover  including island sanctuaries  pest control  wildlife translocation  fostering  and ecological restoration of islands and other selected areas  176][177][178][179   new zealand has a high-income economy with a nominal gross domestic

contributed strongly to new zealand s economy  focussing at different times on sealing  whaling  flax  gold  kauri gum  and native timber  182  with the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to britain  a trade which provided the basis for strong economic growth in new zealand  183  high demand for agricultural products from the united kingdom and the united states helped new zealanders achieve higher living standards than both australia and western europe in the 1950s and 1960s  184  in 1973  new zealand s export market was reduced when the united kingdom joined the european community 185  and other compounding factors  such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis  led to a severe economic depression  186  living standards in new zealand fell behind those of australia and western europe  and by 1982 new zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the world bank  187  in the mid-1980s new
