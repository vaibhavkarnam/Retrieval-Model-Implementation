RenewableenergyinRussia
 renewable energy in russia mainly consists of hydroelectric energy  the country is the sixth largest producer of renewable energy in the world  although it is 56th when hydroelectric energy is not taken into account  1  some 179\xa0twh of russia s energy production comes from renewable energy sources  out of a total economically feasible potential of 1823\xa0twh  2  16  of russia s electricity is generated from hydropower  and less than 1  is generated from all other renewable energy sources combined  roughly 68  of russia s electricity is generated from thermal power and 16  from nuclear power  3   while most of the large hydropower plants in russia date from the soviet era  the abundance of fossil fuels in the soviet union and the russian federation has resulted in little need for the development of other renewable energy sources  there are currently plans to develop all types of renewable energy  which is strongly encouraged by the russian government  4  russian prime minister dmitry medvedev has called for renewable energy to have a larger share of russia s energy output  and has taken steps to promote the development of renewable energy in russia since 2008.[5       most sources of renewable energy are new to russia and have experienced development in recent years  however  hydroelectric power has a long history in russia  dating back to the soviet era  the rapid expansion of hydroelectric power in the soviet union began in 1930  when the total installed capacity equaled 600\xa0mwh  the soviet union built its first windmill in 1941  which had a capacity of 100\xa0kw  6  by the time the soviet union collapsed in 1990  it had a total installed capacity of 65 gwh  the largest dams that russia currently has  including the sayano u2013shushenskaya dam  were built in the 1950s and 1960s  7  from the 1970s to 2000  the soviet union and russia focused mainly on  traditional  power sources  thermal-  hydro- and nuclear power  6  however  in 1986  the soviet government announced new energy goals  which included further hydroelectric plant construction as well as the start of small-scale solar and wind use for electricity production  overall  soviet energy policy focused on nuclear and thermal power  although renewable energy was not completely neglected  the dissolution of the soviet union prevented those goals from being fulfilled  8   the construction of the large dams prominent in soviet times largely ended in the 1990s with the creation of the russian federation  in addition  due to the post-soviet recession  much of the country s infrastructure  including dams  fell into disrepair  7][9  use of oil and gas for energy took priority in russia and renewable energy was ignored  this policy lasted until 2008  when medvedev announced reforms to russia s energy policies in an attempt to focus more on renewable energy  since then  there has been rapid development of new renewable energy sources  10   russia is one of the world s largest producers of energy  most of which it obtains from oil  natural gas and coal  the country s focus on those resources for production and export  which constitute 80  of foreign trade earnings  means it has paid little attention to renewable energy  out of the 203\xa0gw of electric generation capacity that russia has  44\xa0gw comes from hydroelectricity  307\xa0mw from geothermal  15\xa0mw from wind and negligible amounts from other renewable sources  11][12  in 2009  the russian energy industry generated a total 992\xa0twh of electricity  176\xa0twh of which was produced by hydroelectric power stations  13  some of russia s hydroelectric power plants are outdated and are in need of additional investment  as shown by the accident at the sayano-shushenskaya hpp in 2009.[1   president dmitry medvedev announced in may 2010 that the russian government would strongly consider purchasing electricity generated from renewable energy sources in an attempt to encourage development of renewable energy  the government has plans for 4.5  of russia s energy output to come from non-hydroelectric renewable energy sources  5  additionally  in november 2010  the government approved a us 300\xa0billion program to make factories and buildings more energy efficient  it also announced plans to construct eight energy-efficient lamp production plants  promote recycling and support the construction of a hybrid car plant  medvedev announced in late 2009 that he wanted to cut russian energy consumption by 40  by 2020.[10][14  at the moment  development is slowed by low investment  economic instability  low public demand and low tariffs on heat and electricity  15  subsidies for natural gas are another obstacle to renewable energy development  16   hydropower is the most used form of renewable energy in russia  and there is large potential in russia for more use of hydropower  russia has 102 hydropower plants with capacities of over 100\xa0mw  making it fifth in the world for hydropower production  it is also second in the world for hydro potential  yet only 20  of this potential is developed  7  russia is home to 9  of the world s hydro resources  15  mostly in siberia and the country s far east  at the end of 2005  the generating capacity from hydroelectric sources in russia was 45,700\xa0mw  and an additional 5,648\xa0mw was under construction  the world energy council believes that russia has much potential for using its hydro resources  with a theoretical potential of about 2,295\xa0twh yr  with 852\xa0twh being economically feasible  12   the largest dams in russia are the sayano-shushenskaya dam  which has an installed capacity of 6,400\xa0mw  the krasnoyarsk dam (6,000\xa0mw   the bratsk dam (4,500\xa0mw   the ust-ilimsk dam (4,320\xa0mw  and the zeya dam (1,330\xa0mw   7  some of the most recent dam projects are the bureya dam (2010\xa0mw  and the irganai dam (800\xa0mw   the boguchany dam (1920\xa0mw   zelenchuk dam (320\xa0mw   zaramag dam (352\xa0mw  and nizhne-chereksky (60\xa0mw  are currently under construction  12  rushydro is the largest hydroelectric company in russia and the second largest hydroelectric producer in the world  17  in october 2010  china yangtze power  the largest hydropower corporation in china  and eurosibenergo  a russian energy company  signed a cooperation agreement to expand hydroelectric energy production in russia and export energy to china s northern territories  18  the west siberian generating company has plans to start construction of eight mini-hydroelectric power plants in the altai region before 2015.[19   on 17 august 2009  there was an explosion at the sayano-shushenskaya hydroelectric power plant  which killed 75 plant workers and injured 13  the federal service for ecological  technological  and nuclear supervision s investigation concluded that poor management and technical flaws were responsible  20  the explosion was caused by a 29-year-old turbine that experienced an uncontrolled and excessive vibration  since then  officials from rushydro  the operator of the plant  have called for better oversight and safety at hydroelectric plants  20][21   geothermal energy is the second most used form of renewable energy in russia but represents less than 1  of the total energy production  the first geothermal power plant in russia was built at pauzhetka  kamchatka  in 1966  with a capacity of 5\xa0mw  the total geothermal installed capacity in 2005 was 79\xa0mw  with 50\xa0mw coming from a plant at verkhne-mutnovsky  russia is currently developing a 100\xa0mw plant at mutnovsky and a 50\xa0mw plant in kaliningrad  12  most geothermal resources are currently used for heating settlements in the north caucasus and kamchatka  half of the geothermal production is used to heat homes and industrial buildings  one third is used to heat greenhouses and 13  is used for industrial processes  22   in october 2010  sergei shmatko  russia s energy minister  stated that russia and iceland would work together to develop kamchatka s geothermal energy sources  23  russia is also investigating foreign investment possibilities for developing geothermal energy in the kuril islands  24   source  nrel 25   solar energy is virtually nonexistent in russia  despite its large potential in the country  the first russian solar plant was opened in belgorod oblast in november 2010.[26  russia has a total theoretical potential of 2,213\xa0twh yr for solar energy  with an economically feasible amount of 101\xa0twh  the southern parts of russia  especially the north caucasus  have the greatest potential for solar energy  12  russia plans to set up an overall solar capacity of 150\xa0mw by 2020.[27   plans for the construction of a new solar plant on the black sea have been announced and the plant is expected to begin operations by 2012  this plant  which will have a capacity of 12.3\xa0mw  is being built by rusnano and renova  28  solar wind llc and rusnano are building a plant that will produce double-sided solar panels  which will be able to collect solar energy from both sides  construction is expected to finish in early 2011 and the plant will have an annual manufacturing capacity of 30\xa0mw  27  nitol solar is the largest russian company in the area of scientific development and manufacture of products used to generate solar energy  29  russia and india are currently discussing the possibility of a joint venture to produce silicon wafers for the creation of photovoltaic cells  30   an auction in 2013 awarded contracts for 399 mw of solar  and one in 2014 an additional 505 mw  31  a third auction in 2015 awarded 280 mw of solar  32   in 2015  the russian solar energy association predicted that cumulative solar power capacity in the country would rise to 1,500 mw by 2020.[33   russia has a long history of small-scale wind energy use but has never developed large-scale commercial wind energy production  most of its current wind production is located in agricultural areas with low population densities where connection to the main energy grid is difficult  russia is estimated to have a total potential of 80,000 twh yr for wind energy  6,218\xa0twh yr of which is economically feasible  12  most of this potential is found in the southern steppes and the seacoasts of russia  although in many of these areas the population density is less than 1 person per square km  this low population density means that there is little existing electricity infrastructure currently in place  which hinders development of these resources  6  in 2006  russia had a total installed wind capacity of 15\xa0mw  34  current russian wind energy projects have a combined capacity of over 1,700\xa0mw  the russian wind energy association predicts that if russia achieves its goal of having 4.5  of its energy come from renewable sources by 2020  the country will have a total wind capacity of 7\xa0gw  35   in 2010  plans for the construction of a wind power plant in yeisk  on the sea of azov  were announced  it is expected to initially have a capacity of 50\xa0mw  which will become 100\xa0mw a year later  34  german engineering company siemens announced in july 2010  following a visit to russia by chancellor angela merkel  that it would build wind power plants in russia  1  by 2015  the company hopes to install 1,250\xa0mw of capacity in russia  35   russia has many tidal energy resources at its disposal  although they are currently underdeveloped as well  the kola bay and sea of okhotsk alone could produce 100\xa0gw with tidal power stations  and the national energy potential from tidal energy can compete with current total energy production  36  the currently active kislaya guba tidal power station is the largest tidal power facility in russia and has the fourth largest capacity (1.7\xa0mw  among the world s tidal power plants  37   plans for constructing an 800\xa0mw tidal power plant in the barents sea were announced in 2008.[38  possible long-term projects include the penzhin tidal power plant  which could become the largest power station in the world  with an installed capacity of up to 87\xa0gw and an annual production of 200\xa0twh  39   russia s biofuel industry is new  but it has been developing rapidly in recent years  russia is one of the largest grain producers  has a well-developed ethyl alcohol industry and has increasing rapeseed  often used to create biodiesel  production rates  40  the russian government declared in 2008 that it would play an active role in developing the biofuel industry by building 30 new biofuel plants and providing tax breaks and subsidized interest rates to biofuel energy projects  41  although these plans were delayed  on 13 september 2010  medvedev announced that construction would begin in early 2011.[42  biobutanol  the biofuel produced by these plants  would be produced from timber by-products  such as woodchips and sawdust  40][41][43   lada  a russian car manufacturer  produced its first biofuel-powered automobile in november 2010  deputy transportation minister valery okulov stated that russian companies are currently developing helicopters that run on biofuel  41  russia hopes to export biofuel to the european union  44  the country s biotechnology corporation estimates that russia is capable of exporting 40 million tons of biofuel annually  45   biomass is already used in some parts of russia to provide a total of 1   or 9\xa0twh year  of russia s total energy  however  due to russia s vast forest and peat reserves  nb 1  it has a total biomass technical potential of 431\xa0twh year  of which 285\xa0twh year is economically feasible  46][47  most of this potential is found in northwestern russia  which has a developed pulp and paper industry that can provide wood-based waste to use as biomass energy  48   use of peat for energy production was prominent during the soviet union  with the peak occurring in 1965 and declining from that point  in 1929  over 40  of the soviet union s electric energy came from peat  which dropped to 1  by 1980  currently  russia is responsible for 17  of the world s peat production  and 20  of the peat that it produces  1.5 million tons  is used for energy purposes  12][49  shatura power station in moscow oblast and kirov power station in kirov oblast are the two largest peat power stations in the world  50][51
