Australiannationalgovernment
 the government of the commonwealth of australia  also referred to as the australian government  the commonwealth government  or the federal government  is the government of the commonwealth of australia  a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy   the commonwealth of australia was formed in 1901 as a result of an agreement among six self-governing british colonies  which became the six states  the terms of this contract are embodied in the australian constitution  which was drawn up at a constitutional convention and ratified by the people of the colonies at referendums  the australian head of state is the queen of australia who is represented by the governor-general of australia  1][2][3][4][5  with executive powers delegated by constitutional convention to the australian head of government  the prime minister of australia   the government of the commonwealth of australia is divided into the executive branch  composed of the federal executive council presided by the governor-general  which delegates powers to the cabinet of australia led by the prime minister  the legislative branch composed of the parliament of australia s house of representatives and senate  and the judicial branch composed of the high court of australia and federal courts  separation of powers is implied by the structure of the constitution  the three branches of government being set out in separate chapters  chs i to iii   the australian system of government combines elements of the westminster and washington systems with unique australian characteristics  and has been characterised as a  washminster mutation   6       section 1 of the australian constitution creates a democratic legislature  the bicameral parliament of australia which consists of the queen of australia  and two houses of parliament  the senate and the house of representatives  section 51 of the constitution provides for the commonwealth government s legislative powers and allocates certain powers and responsibilities  known as  heads of power   to the commonwealth government  all remaining responsibilities are retained by the six states  previously separate colonies   further  each state has its own constitution  so that australia has seven sovereign parliaments  none of which can encroach on the functions of any other  the high court of australia arbitrates on any disputes which arise between the commonwealth and the states  or among the states  concerning their respective functions   the commonwealth parliament can propose changes to the constitution  to become effective  the proposals must be put to a referendum of all australians of voting age  and must receive a  double majority   a majority of all votes  and a majority of votes in a majority of states   the commonwealth constitution also provides that the states can agree to refer any of their powers to the commonwealth  this may be achieved by way of an amendment to the constitution via referendum  a vote on whether the proposed transfer of power from the states to the commonwealth  or vice versa  should be implemented   more commonly powers may be transferred by passing other acts of legislation which authorise the transfer and such acts require the legislative agreement of all the state governments involved  this  transfer  legislation may have a  sunset clause   a legislative provision that nullifies the transfer of power after a specified period  at which point the original division of power is restored   in addition  australia has several  territories   two of which are self-governing  the australian capital territory  act  and the northern territory  nt   these territories  legislatures  their assemblies  exercise powers devolved to them by the commonwealth  the commonwealth parliament remains able to override their legislation and to alter their powers  australian citizens in these territories are represented by members of both houses of the commonwealth parliament  the territory of norfolk island was self-governing from 1979 until 2016  although it was never represented as such in the commonwealth parliament  the other territories that are regularly inhabited u2014jervis bay  christmas island and the cocos  keeling  islands u2014have never been self-governing   the federal nature of the commonwealth and the structure of the parliament of australia were the subject of protracted negotiations among the colonies during the drafting of the constitution  the house of representatives is elected on a basis that reflects the differing populations of the states  thus new south wales has 48 members while tasmania has only five  but the senate is elected on a basis of equality among the states  all states elect 12 senators  regardless of population  this was intended to allow the senators of the smaller states to form a majority and thus be able to amend or reject bills originating in the house of representatives  the act and the nt each elect two senators   the third level of government after commonwealth and state territory is local government  in the form of shires  towns and cities  the councils of these areas are composed of elected representatives  known as either councillor or alderman  depending on the state   usually serving part-time  their powers are devolved to them by the state or territory in which they are located   government at the commonwealth level and the state territory level is undertaken by three inter-connected arms of government   the separation of powers is the principle whereby the three arms of government undertake their activities largely separately from each other   until the passage of the australia act 1986  and associated legislation in the parliament of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland  some australian cases could be referred to the british judicial committee of the privy council for final appeal  with this act  australian law was made unequivocally sovereign  and the high court of australia was confirmed as the highest court of appeal  the theoretical possibility of the british parliament enacting laws to override the australian constitution was also removed  7   the legislature makes the laws  and supervises the activities of the other two arms with a view to changing the laws when appropriate  the australian parliament is bicameral  consisting of the queen of australia  a 76-member senate and a 150-member house of representatives  twelve senators from each state are elected for six-year terms  using proportional representation and the single transferable vote  known in australia as  quota-preferential voting   see australian electoral system   with half elected every three years   in addition to the state senators  two senators are elected by voters from the northern territory  which for this purpose includes the indian ocean territories  christmas island and the cocos  keeling  islands   while another two senators are elected by the voters of the australian capital territory  which for this purpose includes the jervis bay territory   senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting  but their term of office is not fixed  it starts on the day of a general election for the house of representatives and ends on the day before the next such election   the members of the house of representatives are elected by majority-preferential 8  voting using the non-proportional instant-runoff voting system 9  from single-member constituencies allocated among the states and territories  in ordinary legislation  the two chambers have co-ordinate powers  but all proposals for appropriating revenue or imposing taxes must be introduced in the house of representatives  under the prevailing westminster system  the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the house of representatives is invited to form a government and is named prime minister   the prime minister and the cabinet are responsible to the parliament  of which they must  in most circumstances  be members  general elections are held at least once every three years  the prime minister has a discretion to advise the governor-general to call an election for the house of representatives at any time  but senate elections can only be held within certain periods prescribed in the constitution  the most recent general election was on 2 july 2016   the commonwealth parliament and all the state and territory legislatures operate within the conventions of the westminster system  with a recognised leader of the opposition  usually the leader of the largest party outside the government  and a shadow cabinet of opposition members who  shadow  each member of the ministry  asking questions on matters within the minister s portfolio  although the government  by virtue of commanding a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature  can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house  the opposition can considerably delay the passage of legislation and obstruct government business if it chooses  the day-to-day business of the house is usually negotiated between a designated senior minister  who holds the title leader of the house  and an opposition frontbencher known as the manager of opposition business in the house  the current leader of the opposition in the commonwealth parliament is bill shorten   the australian constitution dates from 1901  when the dominions of the british empire were not sovereign states  and does not use the term  head of state   as australia is a constitutional monarchy  government and academic sources describe the queen as head of state  10  in practice  the role of head of state of australia is divided between two people  the queen of australia and the governor-general of australia  who is appointed by the queen on the advice of the prime minister of australia  though in many respects the governor-general is the queen s representative  and exercises various constitutional powers in her name  they independently exercise many important powers in their own right  the governor-general represents australia internationally  making and receiving state visits  11   the sovereign of australia  currently queen elizabeth ii  is also the sovereign of fifteen other commonwealth realms including the united kingdom  like the other dominions  australia gained legislative independence from the parliament of the united kingdom by virtue of the statute of westminster 1931  which was adopted in australia in 1942 with retrospective effect from 3 september 1939  by the royal style and titles act 1953  the australian parliament gave the queen the title queen of australia  and in 1973 titles with any reference to her status as queen of the united kingdom and defender of the faith as well were removed  making her queen of australia   section 61 of the constitution provides that  the executive power of the commonwealth is vested in the queen and is exercisable by the governor u2011general as the queen s representative  and extends to the execution and maintenance of this constitution  and of the laws of the commonwealth   section 2 of the australian constitution provides that a governor-general shall represent the queen in australia  in practice  the governor-general carries out all the functions usually performed by a head of state  without reference to the queen   under the conventions of the westminster system the governor-general s powers are almost always exercised on the advice of the prime minister or other ministers  the governor-general retains reserve powers similar to those possessed by the queen in the united kingdom  these are rarely exercised  but during the australian constitutional crisis of 1975 governor-general sir john kerr used them independently of the queen and the prime minister   australia has periodically experienced movements seeking to end the monarchy  in a 1999 referendum  the australian people voted on a proposal to change the constitution  the proposal would have removed references to the queen from the constitution and replaced the governor-general with a president nominated by the prime minister  but subject to the approval of a two-thirds majority of both houses of the parliament  the proposal was defeated  the australian republican movement continues to campaign for an end to the monarchy in australia  opposed by australians for constitutional monarchy and australian monarchist league   the federal executive council is a formal body which exists and meets to give legal effect to decisions made by the cabinet  and to carry out various other functions  all ministers are members of the executive council and are entitled to be styled  the honourable   a title which they retain for life  the governor-general usually presides at council meetings  but in his or her absence another minister nominated as the vice-president of the executive council presides at the meeting of the council  since 19 september 2013  the vice-president of the federal executive council has been senator george brandis  who has also been attorney-general in the government   there are times when the government acts in a  caretaker  capacity  principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election   the cabinet of australia is the council of senior ministers of the crown  responsible to the federal parliament  the ministers are appointed by the governor-general  on the advice of the prime minister  who serve at the former s pleasure  cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated  outside the cabinet there is an outer ministry and also a number of junior ministers  called parliamentary secretaries  responsible for a specific policy area and reporting directly to a senior cabinet minister   the constitution of australia does not recognise the cabinet as a legal entity  it exists solely by convention  its decisions do not in and of themselves have legal force  however  it serves as the practical expression of the federal executive council  which is australia s highest formal governmental body  in practice  the federal executive council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the cabinet  all members of the cabinet are members of the executive council  while the governor-general is nominal presiding officer  he almost never attends executive council meetings  a senior member of the cabinet holds the office of vice-president of the executive council and acts as presiding officer of the executive council in the absence of the governor-general   until 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the cabinet  the growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical  and in 1956 robert menzies created a two-tier ministry  with only senior ministers holding cabinet rank  also known within parliament as the front bench  this practice has been continued by all governments except the whitlam government   when the non-labor parties are in power  the prime minister makes all cabinet and ministerial appointments at their own discretion  although in practice they consult with senior colleagues in making appointments  when the liberal party and its predecessors  the nationalist party and the united australia party  have been in coalition with the national party or its predecessor the country party  the leader of the junior coalition party has had the right to nominate their party s members of the coalition ministry  and to be consulted by the prime minister on the allocation of their portfolios   when the labor first held office under chris watson  watson assumed the right to choose members of his cabinet  in 1907  however  the party decided that future labor cabinets would be elected by the members of the parliamentary labor party  the caucus  and the prime minister would retain the right to allocate portfolios  this practice was followed until 2007  between 1907 and 2007  labor prime ministers exercised a predominant influence over who was elected to labor ministries  although the leaders of the party factions also exercised considerable influence  prior to the 2007 general election  the then leader of the opposition  kevin rudd  said that he and he alone would choose the ministry should he become prime minister  his party won the election and he chose the ministry  as he said he would  12   the cabinet meets not only in canberra but also in state capitals  most frequently sydney and melbourne  kevin rudd was in favour of the cabinet meeting in other places  such as major regional cities  13  there are commonwealth parliament offices in each state capital  with those in sydney located in phillip street   there are 18 departments of the australian government  14   as a federation  in australia judicial power is exercised by both federal and state courts   federal judicial power is vested in the high court of australia and such other federal courts created by the federal parliament  including the federal court of australia  the family court of australia  and the federal circuit court of australia  additionally  unlike in the united states  the federal legislature has the power to enact laws which vest federal jurisdiction in state courts  15  since the australian constitution requires a separation of powers at the federal level  only courts may exercise federal judicial power  and conversely  non-judicial functions cannot be vested in courts  16   state judicial power is exercised by each state s supreme court  and such other courts and tribunals created by the state parliaments   the high court is the final court of appeal in australia and has the jurisdiction to hear appeals on matters of both federal and state law  it has both original and appellate jurisdiction  the power of judicial review over laws passed by federal and state parliaments  and has jurisdiction to interpret the constitution of australia  unlike in the united states  there is only one common law of australia  rather than separate common laws for each state  17     prior to 1931  the junior status of dominions was shown in the fact that it was british ministers who advised the king  with dominion ministers  if they met the king at all  escorted by the constitutionally superior british minister  after 1931 all dominion ministers met the king as his ministers as of right  equal in commonwealth status to britain s ministers  meaning that there was no longer either a requirement for  or an acceptance of  the presence of british ministers  the first state to exercise this both symbolic and real independence was the irish free state  australia and other dominions soon followed
