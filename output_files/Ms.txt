 metre per second  american english  meter per second  is an si derived unit of both speed  scalar  and velocity  vector quantity which specifies both magnitude and a specific direction   defined by distance in metres divided by time in seconds   the si unit symbols are m xb7s u22121  m s u22121  m s  or m s  1  sometimes  unofficially  abbreviated as  mps   where metres per second are several orders of magnitude too slow to be convenient  such as in astronomical measurements  velocities may be given in kilometres per second  where 1\xa0km s is 1000 metres per second  sometimes unofficially abbreviated as  kps        1\xa0m s is equivalent to   1 foot per second   0.3048\xa0m s  exactly   1 mile per hour   0.44704\xa0m s  exactly   1\xa0km h   0.27\xa0m s  exactly   1 kilometre per second is equivalent to   the benz  named in honour of karl benz  has been proposed as a name for one metre per second  2  although it has seen some support as a practical unit  3  primarily from german sources  2  it was rejected as the si unit of velocity 4  and has not seen widespread use or acceptance  5
