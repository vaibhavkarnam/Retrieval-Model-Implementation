Artificialphotosynthesis
 artificial photosynthesis is a chemical process that replicates the natural process of photosynthesis  a process that converts sunlight  water  and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen  as an imitation of a natural process it is biomimetic  the term  artificial photosynthesis  is commonly used to refer to any scheme for capturing and storing the energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of a fuel  a solar fuel   photocatalytic water splitting converts water into hydrogen ions and oxygen  and is a major research topic of artificial photosynthesis  light-driven carbon dioxide reduction is another process studied  that replicates natural carbon fixation   research of this topic includes the design and assembly of devices for the direct production of solar fuels  photoelectrochemistry and its application in fuel cells  and the engineering of enzymes and photoautotrophic microorganisms for microbial biofuel and biohydrogen production from sunlight       the photosynthetic reaction can be divided into two half-reactions of oxidation and reduction  both of which are essential to producing fuel  in plant photosynthesis  water molecules are photo-oxidized to release oxygen and protons  the second phase of plant photosynthesis  also known as the calvin-benson cycle  is a light-independent reaction that converts carbon dioxide into glucose  fuel   researchers of artificial photosynthesis are developing photocatalysts that are able to perform both of these reactions  furthermore  the protons resulting from water splitting can be used for hydrogen production  these catalysts must be able to react quickly and absorb a large percentage of the incident solar photons  1   whereas photovoltaics can provide energy directly from sunlight  the inefficiency of fuel production from photovoltaic electricity  indirect process  and the fact that sunshine is not constant throughout the day sets a limit to its use  2][3  one way of using natural photosynthesis is for the production of a biofuel  which is an indirect process that suffers from low energy conversion efficiency  due to photosynthesis  own low efficiency in converting sunlight to biomass   the cost of harvesting and transporting the fuel  and conflicts due to the increasing need of land mass for food production  4  the purpose of artificial photosynthesis is to produce a fuel from sunlight that can be stored conveniently and used when sunlight is not available  by using direct processes  that is  to produce a solar fuel  with the development of catalysts able to reproduce the major parts of photosynthesis  water and sunlight would ultimately be the only needed sources for clean energy production  the only by-product would be oxygen  and production of a solar fuel has the potential to be cheaper than gasoline  5   one process for the creation of a clean and affordable energy supply is the development of photocatalytic water splitting under solar light  this method of sustainable hydrogen production is a major objective for the development of alternative energy systems  6  it is also predicted to be one of the more  if not the most  efficient ways of obtaining hydrogen from water  7  the conversion of solar energy into hydrogen via a water-splitting process assisted by photosemiconductor catalysts is one of the most promising technologies in development  citation needed  this process has the potential for large quantities of hydrogen to be generated in an ecologically sound manner  citation needed  the conversion of solar energy into a clean fuel (h2  under ambient conditions is one of the greatest challenges facing scientists in the twenty-first century  8   two methods are generally recognized for the construction of solar fuel cells for hydrogen production  9   another area of research within artificial photosynthesis is the selection and manipulation of photosynthetic microorganisms  namely green microalgae and cyanobacteria  for the production of solar fuels  many strains are able to produce hydrogen naturally  and scientists are working to improve them  10  algae biofuels such as butanol and methanol are produced both at laboratory and commercial scales  this method has benefited from the development of synthetic biology  10  which is also being explored by the j  craig venter institute to produce a synthetic organism capable of biofuel production  11][12   artificial photosynthesis was first anticipated by the italian chemist giacomo ciamician during 1912.[13  in a lecture that was later published in science 14  he proposed a switch from the use of fossil fuels to radiant energy provided by the sun and captured by technical photochemistry devices  in this switch he saw a possibility to lessen the difference between the rich north of europe and poor south and ventured a guess that this switch from coal to solar energy would  not be harmful to the progress and to human happiness   15   during the late 1960s  akira fujishima discovered the photocatalytic properties of titanium dioxide  the so-called honda-fujishima effect  which could be used for hydrolysis  16   the swedish consortium for artificial photosynthesis  the first of its kind  was established during 1994 as a collaboration between groups of three different universities  lund  uppsala and stockholm  being presently active around lund and the \xc5ngstr xf6m laboratories in uppsala  17  the consortium was built with a multidisciplinary approach to focus on learning from natural photosynthesis and applying this knowledge in biomimetic systems  18   research of artificial photosynthesis is experiencing a boom at the beginning of the 21st century  2  during 2000  commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation  csiro  researchers publicized their intent to emphasize carbon dioxide capture and its conversion to hydrocarbons  19][20  in 2003  the brookhaven national laboratory announced the discovery of an important intermediate part of the reduction of co2 to co  the simplest possible carbon dioxide reduction reaction   which could result in better catalysts  21][22   one of the disadvantages of artificial systems for water-splitting catalysts is their general reliance on scarce  expensive elements  such as ruthenium or rhenium  2  during 2008  with the funding of the united states air force office of scientific research  23  mit chemist and director of the solar revolution project daniel g  nocera and postdoctoral fellow matthew kanan attempted to circumvent this problem by using a catalyst containing the cheaper and more abundant elements cobalt and phosphate  24][25  the catalyst was able to split water into oxygen and protons using sunlight  and could potentially be coupled to a hydrogen gas producing catalyst such as platinum  furthermore  while the catalyst broke down during catalysis  it could self-repair  26  this experimental catalyst design was considered a major improvement by many researchers  27][28   whereas co is the prime reduction product of co2  more complex carbon compounds are usually desired  during 2008  andrew b  bocarsly reported the direct conversion of carbon dioxide and water to methanol using solar energy in a very efficient photochemical cell  29   while nocera and coworkers had accomplished water splitting to oxygen and protons  a light-driven process to produce hydrogen is desirable  during 2009  the leibniz institute for catalysis reported inexpensive iron carbonyl complexes able to do just that  30][31  during the same year  researchers at the university of east anglia also used iron carbonyl compounds to achieve photoelectrochemical hydrogen production with 60  efficiency  this time using a gold electrode covered with layers of indium phosphide to which the iron complexes were linked  32  both of these processes used a molecular approach  where discrete nanoparticles are responsible for catalysis   visible light water splitting with a one piece multijunction cell was first demonstrated and patented by william ayers at energy conversion devices during 1983.[33  this group demonstrated water photolysis into hydrogen and oxygen  now referred to as an  artificial leaf  or  wireless solar water splitting  with a low cost  thin film amorphous silicon multijunction cell immersed directly in water  hydrogen evolved on the front amorphous silicon surface decorated with various catalysts while oxygen evolved from the back metal substrate which also eliminated the hazard of mixed hydrogen oxygen gas evolution  a nafion membrane above the immersed cell provided a path for proton transport  the higher photovoltage available from the multijuction thin film cell with visible light was a major advance over previous photolysis attempts with uv sensitive single junction cells  the group s patent also lists several other semiconductor multijunction compositions in addition to amorphous silicon   during 2009  f  del valle and k  domen showed the effect of the thermal treatment in a closed atmosphere using cd1-xznxs photocatalysts  cd1-xznxs solid solution reports high activity in hydrogen production from water splitting under sunlight irradiation  34  a mixed heterogeneous molecular approach by researchers at the university of california  santa cruz  during 2010  using both nitrogen-doped and cadmium selenide quantum dots-sensitized titanium dioxide nanoparticles and nanowires  also yielded photoproduced hydrogen  35   artificial photosynthesis remained an academic field for many years  however  in the beginning of 2009  mitsubishi chemical holdings was reported to be developing its own artificial photosynthesis research by using sunlight  water and carbon dioxide to  create the carbon building blocks from which resins  plastics and fibers can be synthesized   36  this was confirmed with the establishment of the kaiteki institute later that year  with carbon dioxide reduction through artificial photosynthesis as one of the main goals  37][38   during 2010  the united states department of energy established  as one of its energy innovation hubs  the joint center for artificial photosynthesis  39  the mission of jcap is to find a cost-effective method to produce fuels using only sunlight  water  and carbon-dioxide as inputs  xa0 jcap is managed by a team from caltech  directed by professor nathan lewis and brings together more than 120 scientists and engineers from california institute of technology and its main partner  lawrence berkeley national laboratory  jcap also draws on the expertise and capabilities of key partners from stanford university  the university of california at berkeley  ucsb  university of california  irvine  and university of california at san diego  and the stanford linear accelerator  xa0 additionally  jcap serves as a central hub for other solar fuels research teams across the united states  including 20 doe energy frontier research center  xa0 the program has a budget of $122m over five years  subject to congressional appropriation 40   also during 2010  a team directed by professor david wendell at the university of cincinnati successfully demonstrated photosynthesis in an artificial construct consisting of enzymes suspended in a foam housing  41   during 2011  daniel nocera and his research team announced the creation of the first practical artificial leaf  in a speech at the 241st national meeting of the american chemical society  nocera described an advanced solar cell the size of a poker card capable of splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen  approximately ten times more efficient than natural photosynthesis  42  the cell is mostly made of inexpensive materials that are widely available  works under simple conditions  and shows increased stability over previous catalysts  in laboratory studies  the authors demonstrated that an artificial leaf prototype could operate continuously for at least forty-five hours without a drop in activity  43  in may 2012  sun catalytix  the startup based on nocera s research  stated that it will not be scaling up the prototype as the device offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight  44  leading experts in the field have supported a proposal for a global project on artificial photosynthesis as a combined energy security and climate change solution  45  conferences on this theme have been held at lord howe island during 2011,[46  at chicheley hall in the uk in 2014[47  and at canberra and lord howe island during 2016.[48   in energy terms  natural photosynthesis can be divided in three steps  9][18   using biomimetic approaches  artificial photosynthesis tries to construct systems doing the same type of processes  ideally  a triad assembly could oxidize water with one catalyst  reduce protons with another and have a photosensitizer molecule to power the whole system  one of the simplest designs is where the photosensitizer is linked in tandem between a water oxidation catalyst and a hydrogen evolving catalyst   the state of the triad with one catalyst oxidized on one end and the second one reduced on the other end of the triad is referred to as a charge separation  and is a driving force for further electron transfer  and consequently catalysis  to occur  the different components may be assembled in diverse ways  such as supramolecular complexes  compartmentalized cells  or linearly  covalently linked molecules  9   research into finding catalysts that can convert water  carbon dioxide  and sunlight to carbohydrates or hydrogen is a current  active field  by studying the natural oxygen-evolving complex  oec   researchers have developed catalysts such as the  blue dimer  to mimic its function or inorganic-based materials such as birnessite with the similar building block as the oec  49  photoelectrochemical cells that reduce carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide  co   formic acid  hcooh  and methanol (ch3oh  are under development  50  however  these catalysts are still very inefficient  5   hydrogen is the simplest solar fuel to synthesize  since it involves only the transference of two electrons to two protons  it must  however  be done stepwise  with formation of an intermediate hydride anion   the proton-to-hydrogen converting catalysts present in nature are hydrogenases  these are enzymes that can either reduce protons to molecular hydrogen or oxidize hydrogen to protons and electrons  spectroscopic and crystallographic studies spanning several decades have resulted in a good understanding of both the structure and mechanism of hydrogenase catalysis  51][52  using this information  several molecules mimicking the structure of the active site of both nickel-iron and iron-iron hydrogenases have been synthesized  9][53  other catalysts are not structural mimics of hydrogenase but rather functional ones  synthesized catalysts include structural h-cluster models  9][54  a dirhodium photocatalyst  55  and cobalt catalysts  9][56   water oxidation is a more complex chemical reaction than proton reduction  in nature  the oxygen-evolving complex performs this reaction by accumulating reducing equivalents  electrons  in a manganese-calcium cluster within photosystem ii  ps ii   then delivering them to water molecules  with the resulting production of molecular oxygen and protons   without a catalyst  natural or artificial   this reaction is very endothermic  requiring high temperatures  at least 2500 k   7   the exact structure of the oxygen-evolving complex has been hard to determine experimentally  57  as of 2011  the most detailed model was from a 1.9 \xc5 resolution crystal structure of photosystem ii  58  the complex is a cluster containing four manganese and one calcium ions  but the exact location and mechanism of water oxidation within the cluster is unknown  nevertheless  bio-inspired manganese and manganese-calcium complexes have been synthesized  such as [mn4o4  cubane-type clusters  some with catalytic activity  59   some ruthenium complexes  such as the dinuclear \xb5-oxo-bridged  blue dimer   the first of its kind to be synthesized   are capable of light-driven water oxidation  thanks to being able to form high valence states  9  in this case  the ruthenium complex acts as both photosensitizer and catalyst   many metal oxides have been found to have water oxidation catalytic activity  including ruthenium iv  oxide (ruo2   iridium iv  oxide (iro2   cobalt oxides  including nickel-doped co3o4   manganese oxide  including layered mno2 (birnessite   49  mn2o3   and a mix of mn2o3 with camn2o4  oxides are easier to obtain than molecular catalysts  especially those from relatively abundant transition metals  cobalt and manganese   but suffer from low turnover frequency and slow electron transfer properties  and their mechanism of action is hard to decipher and  therefore  to adjust  6   recently metal-organic framework  mof -based materials have been shown to be a highly promising candidate for water oxidation with first row transition metals  60][61  the stability and tunability of this system is projected to be highly beneficial for future development  62   nature uses pigments  mainly chlorophylls  to absorb a broad part of the visible spectrum  artificial systems can use either one type of pigment with a broad absorption range or combine several pigments for the same purpose   ruthenium polypyridine complexes  in particular tris bipyridine ruthenium ii  and its derivatives  have been extensively used in hydrogen photoproduction due to their efficient visible light absorption and long-lived consequent metal-to-ligand charge transfer excited state  which makes the complexes strong reducing agents  9  other noble metal-containing complexes used include ones with platinum  rhodium and iridium  9   metal-free organic complexes have also been successfully employed as photosensitizers  examples include eosin y and rose bengal  9  pyrrole rings such as porphyrins have also been used in coating nanomaterials or semiconductors for both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis  6][50   as part of current research efforts artificial photonic antenna systems are being studied to determine efficient and sustainable ways to collect light for artificial photosynthesis  gion calzaferri (2009  describes one such antenna that uses zeolite l as a host for organic dyes  to mimic plant s light collecting systems  63  the antenna is fabricated by inserting dye molecules into the channels of zeolite l  the insertion process  which takes place under vacuum and at high temperature conditions  is made possible by the cooperative vibrational motion of the zeolite framework and of the dye molecules  64  the resulting material may be interfaced to an external device via a stopcock intermediate  65][66   in nature  carbon fixation is done by green plants using the enzyme rubisco as a part of the calvin cycle  rubisco is a rather slow catalyst compared to the vast majority of other enzymes  incorporating only a few molecules of carbon dioxide into ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate per minute  but does so at atmospheric pressure and in mild  biological conditions  67  the resulting product is further reduced and eventually used in the synthesis of glucose  which in turn is a precursor to more complex carbohydrates  such as cellulose and starch  the process consumes energy in the form of atp and nadph   artificial co2 reduction for fuel production aims mostly at producing reduced carbon compounds from atmospheric co2  some transition metal polyphosphine complexes have been developed for this end  however  they usually require previous concentration of co2 before use  and carriers  molecules that would fixate co2  that are both stable in aerobic conditions and able to concentrate co2 at atmospheric concentrations haven t been yet developed  68  the simplest product from co2 reduction is carbon monoxide  co   but for fuel development  further reduction is needed  and a key step also needing further development is the transfer of hydride anions to co  68   charge separation is a major property of dyad and triad assemblies  some nanomaterials employed are fullerenes  such as carbon nanotubes   a strategy that explores the pi-bonding properties of these materials  6  diverse modifications  covalent and non-covalent  of carbon nanotubes have been attempted to increase the efficiency of charge separation  including the addition of ferrocene and pyrrole-like molecules such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines  6   since photodamage is usually a consequence in many of the tested systems after a period of exposure to light  bio-inspired photoprotectants have been tested  such as carotenoids  which are used in photosynthesis as natural protectants   69   photoelectrochemical cells are a heterogeneous system that use light to produce either electricity or hydrogen  the vast majority of photoelectrochemical cells use semiconductors as catalysts  50  there have been attempts to use synthetic manganese complex-impregnated nafion as a working electrode  but it has been since shown that the catalytically active species is actually the broken-down complex  70   a promising  emerging type of solar cell is the dye-sensitized solar cell  this type of cell still depends on a semiconductor  such as tio2  for current conduction on one electrode  but with a coating of an organic or inorganic dye that acts as a photosensitizer  the counter electrode is a platinum catalyst for h2 production  50  these cells have a self-repair mechanism and solar-to-electricity conversion efficiencies rivaling those of solid-state semiconductor ones  50   direct water oxidation by photocatalysts is a more efficient usage of solar energy than photoelectrochemical water splitting because it avoids an intermediate thermal or electrical energy conversion step  71   bio-inspired manganese clusters have been shown to possess water oxidation activity when adsorbed on clays together with ruthenium photosensitizers  although with low turnover numbers  9   as mentioned above  some ruthenium complexes are able to oxidize water under solar light irradiation  9  although their photostability is still an issue  many can be reactivated by a simple adjustment of the conditions in which they work  9  improvement of catalyst stability has been tried resorting to polyoxometalates  in particular ruthenium-based ones  6][9   whereas a fully functional artificial system is usually intended when constructing a water splitting device  some mixed methods have been tried  one of these involve the use of a gold electrode to which photosystem ii is linked  an electric current is detected upon illumination  72   the simplest photocatalytic hydrogen production unit consists of a hydrogen-evolving catalyst linked to a photosensitizer  73  in this dyad assembly  a so-called sacrificial donor for the photosensitizer is needed  that is  one that is externally supplied and replenished  the photosensitizer donates the necessary reducing equivalents to the hydrogen-evolving catalyst  which uses protons from a solution where it is immersed or dissolved in  cobalt compounds such as cobaloximes are some of the best hydrogen catalysts  having been coupled to both metal-containing and metal-free photosensitizers  9][74  the first h-cluster models linked to photosensitizers  mostly ruthenium photosensitizers  but also porphyrin-derived ones  were prepared during the early 2000s  9  both types of assembly are under development to improve their stability and increase their turnover numbers  both necessary for constructing a sturdy  long-lived solar fuel cell   as with water oxidation catalysis  not only fully artificial systems have been idealized  hydrogenase enzymes themselves have been engineered for photoproduction of hydrogen  by coupling the enzyme to an artificial photosensitizer  such as [ru bipy 3]2  or even photosystem i  9][73   in natural photosynthesis  the nadp  coenzyme is reducible to nadph through binding of a proton and two electrons  this reduced form can then deliver the proton and electrons  potentially as a hydride  to reactions that culminate in the production of carbohydrates  the calvin cycle   the coenzyme is recyclable in a natural photosynthetic cycle  but this process is yet to be artificially replicated   a current goal is to obtain an nadph-inspired catalyst capable of recreating the natural cyclic process  utilizing light  hydride donors would be regenerated and produced where the molecules are continuously used in a closed cycle  brookhaven chemists are now using a ruthenium-based complex to serve as the acting model  the complex is proven to perform correspondingly with nadp  nadph  behaving as the foundation for the proton and two electrons needed to convert acetone to isopropanol   currently  brookhaven researchers are aiming to find ways for light to generate the hydride donors  the general idea is to use this process to produce fuels from carbon dioxide  75   some photoautotrophic microorganisms can  under certain conditions  produce hydrogen  nitrogen-fixing microorganisms  such as filamentous cyanobacteria  possess the enzyme nitrogenase  responsible for conversion of atmospheric n2 into ammonia  molecular hydrogen is a byproduct of this reaction  and is many times not released by the microorganism  but rather taken up by a hydrogen-oxidizing  uptake  hydrogenase  one way of forcing these organisms to produce hydrogen is then to annihilate uptake hydrogenase activity  this has been done on a strain of nostoc punctiforme  one of the structural genes of the nife uptake hydrogenase was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis  and the mutant strain showed hydrogen evolution under illumination  76   many of these photoautotrophs also have bidirectional hydrogenases  which can produce hydrogen under certain conditions  however  other energy-demanding metabolic pathways can compete with the necessary electrons for proton reduction  decreasing the efficiency of the overall process  also  these hydrogenases are very sensitive to oxygen  10   several carbon-based biofuels have also been produced using cyanobacteria  such as 1-butanol  77   synthetic biology techniques are predicted to be useful for this topic  microbiological and enzymatic engineering have the potential of improving enzyme efficiency and robustness  as well as constructing new biofuel-producing metabolic pathways in photoautotrophs that previously lack them  or improving on the existing ones  10][77  another topic being developed is the optimization of photobioreactors for commercial application  78   research in artificial photosynthesis is necessarily a multidisciplinary topic  requiring a multitude of different expertise  10  some techniques employed in making and investigating catalysts and solar cells include   advantages of solar fuel production through artificial photosynthesis include   disadvantages include   a concern usually addressed in catalyst design is efficiency  in particular how much of the incident light can be used in a system in practice  this is comparable with photosynthetic efficiency  where light-to-chemical-energy conversion is measured  photosynthetic organisms are able to collect about 50  of incident solar radiation  however the theoretical limit of photosynthetic efficiency is 4.6 and 6.0  for c3 and c4 plants respectively  79  in reality  the efficiency of photosynthesis is much lower and is usually below 1   with some exceptions such as sugarcane in tropical climate  80  in contrast  the highest reported efficiency for artificial photosynthesis lab prototypes is 22.4%.[81  however  plants are efficient in using co2 at atmospheric concentrations  something that artificial catalysts still cannot perform  82
