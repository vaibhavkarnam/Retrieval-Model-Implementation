Loadfactorelectrical
 in electrical engineering the load factor is defined as the average load divided by the peak load in a specified time period  1    n n n n nf n nl no na nd n n n  n n naverage load nmaximum load in given time period n n n n n   displaystyle f  load     frac    text average load     text maximum load in given time period     n n  an example  using a large commercial electrical bill   hence   it can be derived from the load profile of the specific device or system of devices  its value is always less than one because maximum demand is always higher than average demand  since facilities likely never operate at full capacity for the duration of an entire 24-hour day  a high load factor means power usage is relatively constant  low load factor shows that occasionally a high demand is set  to service that peak  capacity is sitting idle for long periods  thereby imposing higher costs on the system  electrical rates are designed so that customers with high load factor are charged less overall per kwh  this process along with others is called load balancing or peak shaving   the load factor is closely related to and often confused with the demand factor    n n n n nf n nd ne nm na nn nd n n n  n n nmaximum load in given time period nmaximum possible load n n n n n   displaystyle f  demand     frac    text maximum load in given time period     text maximum possible load     n n  the major difference to note is that the denominator in the demand factor is fixed depending on the system  because of this  the demand factor cannot be derived from the load profile but needs the addition of the full load of the system in question
