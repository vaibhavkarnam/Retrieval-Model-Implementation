Greenvehicle
  na green vehicle  or clean vehicle  or eco-friendly vehicle or environmentally-friendly vehicle is a road motor vehicle that produces less harmful impacts to the environment than comparable conventional internal combustion engine vehicles running on gasoline or diesel  or one that uses certain alternative fuels  3][4][5  presently  in some countries the term is used for any vehicle complying or surpassing the more stringent european emission standards  such as euro6   or california s zero emissions vehicle standards  such as zev  ulev  sulev  pzev   or the low-carbon fuel standards enacted in several countries  6   green vehicles can be powered by alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies and include hybrid electric vehicles  plug-in hybrid electric vehicles  battery electric vehicles  compressed-air vehicles  hydrogen and fuel-cell vehicles  neat ethanol vehicles  flexible-fuel vehicles  natural gas vehicles  clean diesel vehicles  and some sources also include vehicles using blends of biodiesel and ethanol fuel or gasohol  4][7  in november 2016  with an epa-rated fuel economy of 136 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent  mpg-e  (1.7\xa0l 100\xa0km   the 2017 hyundai ioniq electric became the most efficient epa-certified vehicle considering all fuels and of all years  surpassing the 2014-2016 model year all-electric bmw i3.[8][9   several author also include conventional motor vehicles with high fuel economy  as they consider that increasing fuel economy is the most cost-effective way to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector in the short run  10  as part of their contribution to sustainable transport  these vehicles reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions  and contribute to energy independence by reducing oil imports  4][10   an environmental analysis extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions  a life-cycle assessment involves production and post-use considerations  a cradle-to-cradle design is more important than a focus on a single factor such as energy efficiency  11][12       cars with similar production of energy costs can obtain  during the life of the car  operational phase   large reductions in energy costs through several measures   green vehicles include vehicles types that function fully or partly on alternative energy sources other than fossil fuel or less carbon intensive than gasoline or diesel   another option is the use of alternative fuel composition in conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles  making them function partially on renewable energy sources  other approaches include personal rapid transit  a public transportation concept that offers automated  on-demand  non-stop transportation on a network of specially built guideways   examples of vehicles with reduced petroleum consumption include electric cars  plug-in hybrids and fuel cell-powered hydrogen cars   electric cars are typically more efficient than fuel cell-powered vehicles on a tank-to-wheel basis  16  they have better fuel economy than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles but are hampered by range or maximum distance attainable before discharging the battery  the electric car batteries are their main cost  they provide a 0%[17  to 99.9  reduction in co2 emissions compared to an ice  gasoline  diesel  vehicle  depending on the source of electricity  18   hybrid cars may be partly fossil fuel  or biofuel  powered and partly electric or hydrogen-powered  most combine an internal combustion engine with an electric engine  though other variations too exist  the internal combustion engine is often either a gasoline or diesel engine  in rare cases a stirling engine may even be used 19    they are more expensive to purchase but cost redemption is achieved in a period of about 5 years due to better fuel economy  14][15   compressed air cars  stirling-powered vehicles  liquid nitrogen vehicles are even less polluting than electrical vehicles  as the vehicle and its components can be made more environmentally friendly   solar car races are held on a regular basis in order to promote green vehicles and other  green technology   these sleek driver-only vehicles can travel long distances at highway speeds using only the electricity generated instantaneously from the sun   a conventional vehicle can become a greener vehicle by mixing in renewable fuels or using less carbon intensive fossil fuel  typical gasoline-powered cars can tolerate up to 10  ethanol  brazil manufactured cars that run on neat ethanol  though there were discontinued  another available option is a flexible-fuel vehicle which allows any blend of gasoline and ethanol  up to 85  in north america and europe  and up to 100  in brazil  20  another existing option is to convert a conventional gasoline-powered to allow the alternative use of cng  pakistan  argentina  brazil  iran  india  italy  and china have the largest fleets of natural gas vehicles in the world  21   diesel-powered vehicles can often transition completely to biodiesel  though the fuel is a very strong solvent  which can occasionally damage rubber seals in vehicles built before 1994  more commonly  however  biodiesel causes problems simply because it removes all of the built-up residue in an engine  clogging filters  unless care is taken when switching from dirty fossil-fuel derived diesel to bio-diesel  it is very effective at  de-coking  the diesel engines combustion chambers and keeping them clean  biodiesel is the lowest emission fuel available for diesel engines  diesel engines are the most efficient car internal combustion engines  biodiesel is the only fuel allowed in some north american national parks because spillages will completely bio-degrade within 21 days  biodiesel and vegetable oil fuelled  diesel engined vehicles have been declared amongst the greenest in the us tour de sol competition   this presents problems  as biofuels can use food resources in order to provide mechanical energy for vehicles  many experts point to this as a reason for growing food prices  particularly us bio-ethanol fuel production which has affected maize prices  in order to have a low environmental impact  biofuels should be made only from waste products  or from new sources like algae   multiple companies are offering and developing two  three  and four wheel vehicles combining the characteristics of a bicycle with electric motors  us federal  state and local laws do not clearly nor consistently classify [22  these vehicles as bicycles  electric bicycles  motorcycles  electric motorcycles  mopeds  neighborhood electric vehicle  motorised quadricycle or as a car  some laws have limits on top speeds  power of the motors  range  etc  while others do not  23][24][25][26   horse and carriage are just one type of animal propelled vehicle  once a common form of transportation  they became far less common as cities grew and automobiles took their place  in dense cities  the waste produced by large numbers of transportation animals was a significant health problem  oftentimes the food is produced for them using diesel powered tractors  and thus there is some environmental impact as a result of their use   human powered transport includes walking  bicycles  velomobiles  row boats  and other environmentally friendly ways of getting around  in addition to the health benefits of the exercise provided  they are far more environmentally friendly than most other options  the only downside is the speed limitations  and how far one can travel before getting exhausted   vehicle emissions contribute to the increasing concentration of gases linked to climate change  27  in order of significance  the principal greenhouse gases associated with road transport are carbon dioxide (co2   methane (ch4  and nitrous oxide (n2o   28  road transport is the third largest source of greenhouse gases emitted in the uk  and accounts for over 20  of total emissions  29  and 33  in the united states  30  of the total greenhouse gas emissions from transport  over 85  are due to co2 emissions from road vehicles  the transport sector is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gases  31   vehicle pollutants have been linked to human ill health including the incidence of respiratory and cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer  a 1998 report estimated that up to 24,000 people die prematurely each year in the uk as a direct result of air pollution  32  according to the world health organisation  up to 13,000 deaths per year among children  aged 0\u20134 years  across europe are directly attributable to outdoor pollution  the organization estimates that if pollution levels were returned to within eu limits  more than 5,000 of these lives could be saved each year   hybrid taxi fleet operators in new york have also reported that reduced fuel consumption saves them thousands of dollars per year  33   a study by cnw marketing research suggested that the extra energy cost of manufacture  shipping  disposal  and the short lives of some of these types of vehicle  particularly gas-electric hybrid vehicles  outweighs any energy savings made by their using less petroleum during their useful lifespan  34  this type of argument is the long smokestack argument  35  critics of the report note that the study prorated all of toyota s hybrid research-and-development costs across the relatively small number of priuses on the road  rather than using the incremental cost of building a vehicle  used109,000 miles (175,000\xa0km  for the length of life of a prius  toyota offers a 150,000-mile (240,000\xa0km  warranty on the prius  hybrid components  including the battery   and calculated that a majority of a car s cradle-to-grave energy gets expended during the vehicle s production  not while it is driven  36  norwegian consumer ombudsman official bente \xd8verli stated that  cars cannot do anything good for the environment except less damage than others   based on this opinion  norwegian law severely restricts the use of  greenwashing  to market automobiles  strongly prohibiting advertising a vehicle as being environmentally friendly  with large fines issued to violators  37][38][39][40   a study that looked at other factors other than energy consumption and carbon emissions has suggested that there is no such thing as an environmentally friendly car  41   the use of vehicles with increased fuel efficiency is usually considered positive in the short term but criticism of any hydrocarbon-based personal transport remains  the jevons paradox suggests that energy efficiency programs are often counter-productive  even increasing energy consumption in the long run  42  many environmental researchers believe that sustainable transport may require a move away from hydrocarbon fuels and from our present automobile and highway paradigm  43][44][45   the european union is promoting the marketing of greener cars via a combination of binding and non-binding measures  46  as of april 2010  15 of the 27 member states of the european union provide tax incentives for electrically chargeable vehicles and some alternative fuel vehicles  which includes all western european countries except italy and luxembourg  plus the czech republic and romania  the incentives consist of tax reductions and exemptions  as well as of bonus payments for buyers of electric cars  plug-in hybrids  hybrid electric vehicles and natural gas vehicles  47][48   the united states environmental protection agency  epa  is promoting the marketing of greener cars via the smartway program  the smartway and smartway elite designation mean that a vehicle is a better environmental performer relative to other vehicles  this us epa designation is arrived at by taking into account a vehicle s air pollution score and greenhouse gas score  higher air pollution scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of pollutants that cause smog relative to other vehicles  higher greenhouse gas scores indicate vehicles that emit lower amounts of carbon dioxide and have improved fuel economy relative to other vehicles   to earn the smartway designation  a vehicle must earn at least a 6 on the air pollution score and at least a 6 on the greenhouse gas score  but have a combined score of at least 13  smartway elite is given to those vehicles that score 9 or better on both the greenhouse gas and air pollution scores   a green vehicle marketing alliance  in conjunction with the oak ridge national laboratory  onrl   periodically meets  and coordinates marketing efforts  49   the progressive insurance automotive x prize  piaxp  is a set of competitions  programs and events  from the x prize foundation to  inspire a new generation of super-efficient vehicles that help break america s addiction to oil and stem the effects of climate change   50  progressive insurance is the title sponsor of the prize  the centerpiece of which is the competition division  within which a $10 million purse will be divided between the winners of three competitions   the essence of each competition is to design  build and race super-efficient vehicles that will achieve 100 mpge (2.35 liter 100 kilometer  and can be produced for the mass market  51  within the competition division  there are two vehicle classes  mainstream and alternative  the mainstream class has a prize of $5 million  the alternate class has 2 separate prizes of $2.5 million  one for side-by-side seating and one for tandem seating  52   some of the competitors  such as aptera and tesla  are already taking deposits for  green  vehicles from customers   several automobile magazines  motor vehicle specialized publications and environmental groups publish annual rankings or listings of the best green cars of a given year  the following table presents a selection of the annual top pickings   dedicated electric and green vehicle motor shows
