7,491 kilometers (4,655\xa0mi  15  it borders all other south american countries except ecuador and chile and covers 47.3  of the continent s land area  16  its amazon river basin includes a vast tropical forest  home to diverse wildlife  a variety of ecological systems  and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats  15  this unique environmental heritage makes brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries  and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection   brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer pedro \xc1lvares cabral  who claimed the area for the portuguese empire  brazil remained a portuguese colony until 1808  when the capital of the empire was transferred from lisbon to rio de janeiro  in 1815  the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the united kingdom of portugal  brazil and the algarves  independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the empire of brazil  a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system  the ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature  now called the national congress  the country became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d  xe9tat  an authoritarian military junta came to power in 1964 and ruled until 1985  after which civilian governance resumed  brazil s current constitution  formulated in 1988  defines it as a democratic federal republic  17  the federation

some analysts identifying it as an emerging global power  23  one of the world s major breadbaskets  brazil has been the largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years  24       it is likely that the word  brazil  comes from the portuguese word for brazilwood  a tree that once grew plentifully along the brazilian coast  25  in portuguese  brazilwood is called pau-brasil  with the word brasil commonly given the etymology  red like an ember   formed from latin brasa   ember   and the suffix -il  from -iculum or -ilium   26  as brazilwood produces a deep red dye  it was highly valued by the european cloth industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from brazil  27  throughout the 16th century  massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples  mostly tupi  along the brazilian coast  who sold the timber to european traders  mostly portuguese  but also french  in return for assorted european consumer goods  28   the official portuguese name of the land  in original portuguese records  was the  land of the holy cross   terra da santa cruz   29  but european sailors and merchants commonly called it simply the  land of brazil   terra do brasil  on account of the brazilwood trade  30  the popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official portuguese name  early sailors sometimes also called it the  land of parrots   terra di papaga   31   in the guarani language  an official language of paraguay  brazil is called  pindorama   this was the name the indigenous population gave to the region  meaning  land of the palm trees   32   the earliest human remains found in the americas  luzia woman  were found in the area of pedro leopoldo  minas gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years  33][34  the earliest pottery ever found in the western hemisphere was excavated in the amazon basin of brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago (6000 bc   the pottery was found near santar xe9m and provides evidence that the tropical forest region supported a complex prehistoric culture  35   around the time of the portuguese arrival  the territory of current day brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people  36  mostly semi-nomadic who subsisted on hunting  fishing  gathering  and migrant agriculture  the indigenous population of brazil comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups  e g  the tupis  guaranis  g xeas and arawaks   the tup xed people were subdivided into the tupiniquins and tupinamb xe1s  and there were also many subdivisions of the other groups  37   before the arrival of europeans  the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture  language and moral beliefs  38  these wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water  with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war  39][40  while heredity had some weight  leadership status was more subdued over time  than allocated in succession ceremonies and conventions  41  slavery among the indians had a different meaning than it had for europeans  since it originated from a diverse socio-economic organization  in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations  42   the land now called brazil was claimed for the portuguese empire on 22 april 1500  with the arrival of the portuguese fleet commanded by pedro \xc1lvares cabral  43  the portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several tribes  most of whom spoke languages of the tupi u2013guarani family  and fought among themselves  44  though the first settlement was founded in 1532  colonization was effectively begun in 1534  when king dom jo xe3o xa0iii of portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincy colonies of brazil  45][46   however  the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincy colonies proved problematic  and in 1549 the portuguese king restructured them into the governorate general of brazil  a single and centralized portuguese colony in south america  46][47  in the first two centuries of colonization  indigenous and european groups lived in constant war  establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other  48][49][50][51  by the mid-16th century  cane sugar had become brazil s most important exportation product  44][52  and slaves purchased in sub-saharan africa  in the slave market of western africa 53   not only those from portuguese allies of their colonies in angola and mozambique   had become its largest import  54][55  to cope with plantations of sugarcane  due to increasing international demand for brazilian sugar  56][57   by the end of the 17th century  sugarcane exports began to decline  58  and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony s economy  fostering a brazilian gold rush 59  which attracted thousands of new settlers to brazil from portugal and all portuguese colonies around the world  60  this increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers  61   portuguese expeditions known as bandeiras gradually advanced the portugal colonial original frontiers in south america to approximately the current brazilian borders  62][63  in this era other european powers tried to colonize parts of brazil  in incursions that the portuguese had to fight  notably the french in rio during the 1560s  in maranh xe3o during the 1610s  and the dutch in bahia and pernambuco  during the dutch u2013portuguese war  after the end of iberian union  64   the portuguese colonial administration in brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of portugal s wealthiest and largest colony  to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance  such as the quilombo of palmares  65  and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence  such as the minas conspiracy  66   in late 1807  spanish and napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental portugal  causing prince regent jo xe3o  in the name of queen maria i  to move the royal court from lisbon to brazil  67  there they established some of brazil s first financial institutions  such as its local stock exchanges  68  and its national bank  additionally ending the portuguese monopoly on brazilian trade and opening brazil to other nations  in 1809  in retaliation for being forced into exile  the prince regent ordered the portuguese conquest of french guiana  69   with the end of the peninsular war in 1814  the courts of europe demanded that queen maria i and prince regent jo xe3o return to portugal  deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient european monarchy to reside in a colony  in 1815  in order to justify continuing to live in brazil  where the royal court had thrived for the past six years  the crown established the united kingdom of portugal  brazil  and the algarves  thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state  70  however  such a ploy didn t last long  since the leadership in portugal resentful with the new status of its larger colony  continued to require the return of court to lisbon  as postulated by the liberal revolution of 1820   as well as groups of brazilians  impatient for practical and real changes still demanded independence and a republic  as showed by the 1817 pernambucan revolt  70  in 1821  as a demand of revolutionaries who had taken the city of porto  71  d  jo xe3o vi was unable to hold out any longer  and departed for lisbon  there he swore oath to the new constitution  leaving his son  prince pedro de alc xe2ntara  as regent of the kingdom of brazil  72   tensions between portuguese and brazilians increased  and the portuguese cortes  guided by the new political regime imposed by the 1820 liberal revolution  tried to re-establish brazil as a colony  73  the brazilians refused to yield  and prince pedro decided to stand with them  declaring the country s independence from portugal on 7 september 1822.[74  a month later  prince pedro was declared the first emperor of brazil  with the regnal title of dom pedro xa0i  resulting in the foundation of the empire of brazil  75   the brazilian war of independence  which had already begun along this process  spread through northern  northeastern regions and in cisplatina province  76  with the last portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 march 1824,[77  portugal officially recognized brazil on 29 august 1825.[78  non 7 april 1831  worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissensions with both liberal and conservative sides of politics  including an attempt of republican secession  79  as well as unreconciled with the way that absolutists in portugal had given to the succession of king john vi  pedro xa0i went to portugal to reclaim his daughter s crown  abdicating the brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir  who thus became the empire s second monarch  with the regnal title of dom pedro xa0ii   80   as the new emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he became of age  a regency was set up by the national assembly  81  in the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power  during this period a series of localized rebellions took place  as the cabanagem  the mal xea revolt  the balaiada  the sabinada  and the ragamuffin war  which emerged from the dissatisfaction of the provinces with the central power  coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar of a vast  slaveholding and newly independent nation state  82  this period of internal political and social upheaval  which included the praieira revolt  was overcome only at the end of the 1840s  years after the end of the regency  which occurred with the premature coronation of pedro ii in 1841.[83   during the last phase of the monarchy  internal political debate was centered on the issue of slavery  the atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850,[84  as a result of the british aberdeen act  but only in may 1888 after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country  was the institution formally abolished  85   the foreign affairs in the monarchy were basically related issues with the countries of the southern cone with which brazil has borders  long after the cisplatine war that resulted in independence for uruguay  86  brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of pedro xa0ii  these were the platine war  the uruguayan war and the devastating paraguayan war  the largest war effort in brazilian history  87][88   on 15 november 1889  worn out by years of economic stagnation  in attrition with the majority of army officers  as well as with rural and financial elites  for different reasons   the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup  89   the  early republican government was little more than a military dictatorship  with army dominating affairs both at rio de janeiro and in the states  freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power   90  in 1894  following the unfoldings of two severe crises  an economic along with a military one  the republican civilians rose to power  91][92][93   little by little  a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent  that in the wake of the murder of his running mate  the defeated opposition presidential candidate get xfalio vargas supported by most of the military  successfully led the brazilian revolution of 1930.[94][95  vargas was supposed to assume power temporarily  but instead closed the congress  extinguished the constitution  ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states  governors with his own supporters  96][97   in the 1930s  three major attempts to remove vargas and his supporters from power occurred  the first was the failed constitutionalist revolution of 1932  the second was the anti-fascist brazilian uprising of 1935 led by communists  and the fascist integralist movement attempted a coup in may 1938.[98][99][100  the 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which the congress transferred more power to the executive  the 1937 coup d  xe9tat resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election  installed vargas as a dictator  and began the estado novo era  noted for government brutality and censorship of the press  101   in foreign policy  the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of the republican period  102  was followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the league of nations  103  after its involvement in world war i  104][105  in world war ii brazil remained neutral until august 1942  when the country entered on the allied side  106][107  after suffering retaliations undertaken by nazi germany and fascist italy  due to the country having severed diplomatic relations with axis powers in the wake of the pan-american conference  108   with the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the nazi-fascist regimes in europe  vargas s position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup  with democracy being  reinstated  by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years before  109  vargas committed suicide in august 1954 amid a political crisis  after having returned to power by election in 1950.[110][111   several brief interim governments succeeded after vargas s suicide  112  juscelino kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises  113  the economy and industrial sector grew remarkably  114  but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of bras xedlia  inaugurated in 1960.[115  his successor was j xe2nio quadros  who resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office  116  his vice-president  jo xe3o goulart  assumed the presidency  but aroused strong political opposition 117  and was deposed in april 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military regime  118   the new regime was intended to be transitory 119  but it gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the fifth institutional act in 1968.[120  the oppression was not limited to only those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime  but also reached institutional opponents  artists  journalists and other members of civil society  121][122  inside and outside the country  through the infamous  operation condor    123][124  despite its brutality  like other totalitarian regimes in history  due to an economic boom  known as an  economic miracle   the regime reached its highest level of popularity in the early 1970s  125   slowly however  the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression  even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas  126  plus the inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure  made an opening policy inevitable  which from the regime side was led by generals geisel and golbery  127  with the enactment of the amnesty law in 1979  brazil began its slow return to democracy  which would be completed during the 1980s  83   civilians returned to power in 1985 when jos xe9 sarney assumed the presidency  becoming unpopular during his tenure due to his failure in controlling the economic crisis and hyperinflation inherited from the military regime  128  sarney s unsuccessful government allowed the election in 1989 of the almost unknown fernando collor  who was subsequently impeached by the national congress in 1992.[129   collor was succeeded by his vice-president itamar franco  who appointed fernando henrique cardoso as minister of finance  in 1994  cardoso produced a highly successful plano real  130  that  after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation  finally granted stability to the brazilian economy  131][132  leading cardoso to be elected that year  and again in 1998.[133   the peaceful transition of power from fernando henrique to his main opposition leader  luiz in xe1cio lula da silva  elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006   was seen as a proof that brazil had finally succeeded in achieving a long-sought political stability  134][135  however  sparked by indignation and frustrations accumulated over decades  against corruption  police brutality  inefficiencies of political establishment and public service   numerous peaceful protests erupted in brazil from the middle of first term of dilma rousseff  who succeeded lula in 2010).[136][137  enhanced by a political and economic crises with evidences of involvement of politicians from all main political parties in several bribery and tax evasion schemes  138][139  with large street protests for and against her  140  rousseff was impeached by the brazilian congress in 2016.[6][141   brazil occupies a large area along
