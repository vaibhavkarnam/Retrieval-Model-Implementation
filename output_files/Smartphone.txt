Smartphone
 a smartphone is a mobile phone  also known as cell phones or cell mobiles  with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use  1][2][3  smartphones  which are pocket-sized  typically combine the features of a mobile phone  such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages  with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants  pdas   such as an event calendar  media player  video games  gps navigation  digital camera and digital video camera  smartphones can access the internet and can run a variety of third-party software components   apps  from places like google play store or apple app store   they typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76  of the front surface  the display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the priv passport blackberrys  which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate  app  features   in 1999  the japanese firm ntt docomo released the first smartphones to achieve mass adoption within a country  4  smartphones became widespread in the late 2000s  most of those produced from 2012 onward have high-speed mobile broadband 4g lte  motion sensors  and mobile payment features  in the third quarter of 2012  one billion smartphones were in use worldwide  5  global smartphone sales surpassed the sales figures for regular cell phones in early 2013.[6   devices that combined telephony and computing were first conceptualized by nikola tesla in 1909 and theodore paraskevakos in 1971 and patented in 1974  and were offered for sale beginning in 1993  paraskevakos was the first to introduce the concepts of intelligence  data processing and visual display screens into telephones  in 1971  while he was working with boeing in huntsville  alabama  paraskevakos demonstrated a transmitter and receiver that provided additional ways to communicate with remote equipment  however it did not yet have general purpose pda applications in a wireless device typical of smartphones  they were installed at peoples  telephone company in leesburg  alabama and were demonstrated to several telephone companies  the original and historic working models are still in the possession of paraskevakos  7   the first mobile phone to incorporate pda features was a prototype developed by frank canova 9  in 1992 while at ibm and demonstrated that year at the comdex computer industry trade show  it included pda features and other visionary mobile applications such as maps  stock reports and news  a refined version was marketed to consumers in 1994 by bellsouth under the name simon personal communicator  the simon was the first commercially available device that could be properly referred to as a  smartphone   although it was not called that in 1994.[9][10][11  in addition to placing and receiving cellular calls  simon could send and receive faxes and emails and included an address book  calendar  appointment scheduler  calculator  world time clock and notepad  utilizing its touch screen display  12  the term  smart phone  appeared in print as early as 1995  describing at amp t s phonewriter communicator  13  non-primary source needed   in the mid-late 1990s  many mobile phone users carried a separate dedicated pda device  running early versions of operating systems such as palm os  blackberry os or windows ce pocket pc  1  these operating systems would later evolve into mobile operating systems  in march 1996  hewlett-packard released the omnigo 700lx  a modified hp 200lx palmtop pc that supported a nokia 2110 phone with rom-based software to support it  it had a 640\xd7200 resolution cga compatible four-shade gray-scale lcd screen and could be used to place and receive calls  and to create and receive text messages  emails and faxes  it was also 100  dos 5.0 compatible  allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles  including early versions of windows   in august 1996  nokia released the nokia 9000 communicator  a digital cellular phone based on the nokia 2110 with an integrated pda based on the pen geos 3.0 operating system from geoworks  the two components were attached by a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design  with the display above and a physical qwerty keyboard below  the pda provided e-mail  calendar  address book  calculator and notebook applications  text-based web browsing  and could send and receive faxes  when closed  the device could be used as a digital cellular phone  in june 1999 qualcomm released the  pdq smartphone   a cdma digital pcs smartphone with an integrated palm pda and internet connectivity  14   subsequent landmark devices included   smartphones before present-day android-  ios- and blackberry-based phones typically used the symbian operating system  originally developed by psion  it was the world s most widely used smartphone operating system until the last quarter of 2010  citation needed   in 1999  the japanese firm ntt docomo released the first smartphones to achieve mass adoption within a country  these phones ran on i-mode  which provided data transmission speeds up to 9.6 kbit s  21  unlike future generations of wireless services  ntt docomo s i-mode used chtml  a language which restricted some aspects of traditional html in favor of increasing data speed for the devices  limited functionality  small screens and limited bandwidth allowed for phones to use the slower data speeds available  22  the rise of i-mode helped ntt docomo accumulate an estimated 40 million subscribers by the end of 2001  it was also ranked first in market capitalization in japan and second globally  this power would wane in the face of the rise of 3g and new phones with advanced wireless network capabilities  23  outside japan smartphones were still rare until the introduction of the danger hiptop in 2002  which saw moderate success in the us as the t-mobile sidekick  later  in the mid-2000s  devices based on microsoft s windows mobile started to gain popularity among business users in the u s  the blackberry later gained mass adoption in the u s   and american users popularized the term  crackberry  in 2006 due to its addictive nature  24  the company first released its gsm blackberry 6210  blackberry 6220  and blackberry 6230 devices in 2003.[25   symbian was the most popular smartphone os in europe during the middle to late 2000s  initially  nokia s symbian devices were focused on business  similar to windows mobile and blackberry devices at the time  from 2006 onwards  nokia started producing entertainment-focused smartphones  popularized by the nseries  in asia  with the exception of japan  the trend was similar to that of europe  citation needed  in 2003  motorola launched the first smartphone to use linux  the a760 handset  26  while the initial release was limited to a single high-end handset only available in the asia-pacific region  the maker s intention was to eventually use linux on most of its handsets  including the lower-end models  further models to use linux such as the motorola ming a1200i in 2005 and several successors to the ming line would be unveiled through 2010  in late 2009  motorola released the motorola cliq  27  the first of motorola s smartphones to run the linux-based android operating system   in early 2007  apple inc  introduced the iphone  one of the first smartphones to use a multi-touch interface  the iphone was notable for its use of a large touchscreen for direct finger input as its main means of interaction  instead of a stylus  keyboard  or keypad typical for smartphones at the time  28  in october 2008  the first phone to use android called the htc dream  also known as the t-mobile g1  was released  29][30  android is an open-source platform founded by andy rubin and now owned by google  31][32  although android s adoption was relatively slow at first  it started to gain widespread popularity in 2010  and in early 2012 dominated the smartphone market share worldwide  which continues to this day  33   these new platforms led to the decline of earlier ones  microsoft  for instance  started a new os from scratch  called windows phone  nokia abandoned symbian and partnered with microsoft to use windows phone on its smartphones  windows phone then became the third-most-popular os  palm s webos was bought by hewlett-packard and later sold to lg electronics for use on lg smart tvs  blackberry limited  formerly known as research in motion  also made a new platform based on qnx  blackberry 10  which was later discontinued  the capacitive touchscreen also changed smartphone form factors  before 2007  it was common for devices to have a physical numeric keypad or physical qwerty keyboard in either a candybar or sliding form factor  however  by mid 2010s  almost all smartphones were touchscreen phones   in 2013  the fairphone company launched its first  socially ethical  smartphone at the london design festival to address concerns regarding the sourcing of materials in the manufacturing  34  in late 2013  qsalpha commenced production of a smartphone designed entirely around security  encryption and identity protection  35  in december 2013  the world s first curved oled technology smartphones were introduced to the retail market with the sale of the samsung galaxy round and lg g flex models  36  samsung phones with more bends and folds in the screens were expected in 2014.[37  in 2013  water- and dustproofing made their way into mainstream high end smartphones including the sony xperia z  sony xperia z3 and samsung galaxy s5.[38  previously  this feature was confined to special ruggedized phones designed for outdoor use   in early 2014  smartphones were beginning to use quad hd (2k  2560x1440 on 5.5  screens with up to 534 ppi on devices such as the lg g3 which is a significant improvement over apple s retina display  quad hd is used in advanced televisions and computer monitors  but with 110 ppi or less on such larger displays  39  in 2014  wi-fi networks were used a lot for smartphones  as wi-fi became more prevalent and easier to connect to  it was predicted that wi-fi phone services will start to take off  40][41][42  in 2014  lg introduced lasers on the lg g3 to help camera focus  43  in 2014  some smartphones had such good digital cameras that they could be categorized as high-end point-and-shoot cameras with large sensors up to 1  with 20 megapixels and 4k video  some can store their pictures in proprietary raw image format  but the android  operating system  5.0 lollipop serves open source raw images  44][45  by 2015  smartphones were increasingly integrated with everyday uses  for instance  credit cards  mobile payments  and mobile banking were integrated into smartphone applications and software as a service  saas  platforms  46  additionally  recent technological innovations are causing the role of traditional keys to be fused into the smartphones  because a smartphone can act as a digital key and access badge for its users  47  in october 2015  microsoft announced windows continuum  a feature that allows users to connect their devices to an external monitor via microsoft continuum display dock  48  hp adds a layer to the continuum with their hp workplace which enables user to run a win32 app by a virtualized server  49  the first modular smartphone available to the public was the fairphone 2  which was released in december 2015  unlike most smartphones  users can remove and replace parts on this phone   foldable oled smartphones have been anticipated for years but have failed to materialize because of the relatively high failure rate when producing these screens  citation needed  as well  creating a battery that can be folded is another hurdle  50   one of the main characteristics of smartphones is their screen  it usually fills most of the phone s front surface  about 70    screen size usually defines the size of a smartphone  many have an aspect ratio of 16:9  some are 4:3 or other ratios  they are measured in diagonal inches  starting from 2.45 inches  51  phones with screens larger than 5.2 inches are often called  phablets   smartphones with screens over 4.5 inches commonly are shifted while using a single hand  since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface  or used in place with both hands  liquid-crystal displays are the most common  others are ips  led  oled  amoled and e ink displays  in the 2010s  braille screens  which can be used by visually impaired people are being developed  it is expected that braille screens will use some type of microfluidics technology  52  in addition  some displays are integrated with pressure sensitive digitizers such as those developed by wacom  company  and samsung  these digitizers allow users to have greater precision when utilizing touch-screens for drawing or for jotting down notes  53   as with cellphones  a range of accessories are sold for smartphones  including cases  screen protectors  power charging cables  add-on batteries  headphones  combined headphone-microphones which allow a person to use the phone without holding it to the ear  and bluetooth-enabled powered speakers that enable users to listen to music files stored on their smartphones  cases range from relatively inexpensive rubber or soft plastic cases which provide moderate protection from bumps and good protection from scratches to more expensive  heavy-duty cases that combine a rubber padding with a hard outer shell  some cases have a  book -like form  with a cover that the user opens to use the device  when the cover is closed  it protects the screen  some  book -like cases have additional pockets for credit cards  thus enabling people to use them as wallets  accessories include products sold by the manufacturer of the smartphone and compatible products made by other manufacturers   android is a mobile operating system developed by google  and backed by an industry consortium known as the open handset alliance  it is an open source platform with optional proprietary components  including a suite of flagship software for google services  and the application and content storefront google play  54  android was officially introduced via the release of its inaugural device  the htc dream  t-mobile g1  on 20 october 2008.[55  as an open source product  android has also been the subject of third-party development  development groups have used the android source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system  such as cyanogenmod  to add features to the os and provide newer versions of android to devices that no longer receive official updates from their vendor  56][57][58  forked versions of android have also been adopted by other vendors  such as amazon com  who used its  fire os  on a range of tablets and the fire phone  59][60  as it is a non-proprietary platform that has shipped on devices covering a wide range of market segments  android has seen significant adoption  gartner research estimated that 325 million android smartphones

navigation  eschewing physical controls such as physical keyboards in favor of those rendered by the operating system itself on its touchscreen  including the keyboard   and the use of skeumorphism u2014making features and controls within the user interface resemble real-world objects and concepts in order to improve their usability  64][65  in 2008  apple introduced the app store  a centralized storefront for purchasing new software for iphone devices  66][67  ios can also integrate with apple s desktop music program itunes to sync media to a personal computer  68][69  the dependency on a pc was removed with the introduction of icloud on later versions of ios  which provides synchronization of user data via internet servers between multiple devices  70  the iphone line s early dominance was credited with reshaping the smartphone industry  and helping make apple one of the world s most valuable publicly traded companies by 2011  however  the iphone and ios have generally been in second place in worldwide market share  61][71][72   windows 10 mobile  formerly known as windows phone  is from microsoft  it is closed source and proprietary  it has the third largest installed base

are made primarily by microsoft mobile nokia  and also by htc and samsung   in january 2015  microsoft announced that its windows phone brand will be phased out and replaced with windows 10 mobile  bringing tighter integration and unification with its pc counterpart windows 10  and provide a platform for smartphones and tablets with screen sizes under 8 inches   windows mobile smartphone series has had poor adoption  that also led to a decrease in third-party applications  and some vendors ended their support for windows mobile altogether  73][74  as of 2016  windows 10 mobile global market share dropped below 0.6%.[75   tizen is a linux-based operating system for devices  including smartphones  tablets  in-vehicle infotainment  ivi  devices  smart tvs  laptops and smart cameras  tizen

study at the university of utah found a sixfold increase in distraction-related accidents when texting  125  due to the increasing complexity of smartphones  this has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices  this is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands-free usage  rather than those which ban handheld use only  as officials cannot easily tell which function of the mobile phone is being used simply by looking at the driver  this can lead to
