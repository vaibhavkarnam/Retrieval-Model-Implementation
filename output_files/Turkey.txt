hellenized  a process which continued under the roman empire and its transition into the byzantine empire  14][16  the seljuk turks began migrating into the area in the 11th century  starting the process of turkification  which was accelerated by the seljuk victory over the byzantines at the battle of manzikert in 1071.[17  the seljuk sultanate of r xfbm ruled anatolia until the mongol invasion in 1243  when it disintegrated into small turkish beyliks  18   in the mid-14th century the ottomans started uniting anatolia and created an empire encompassing much of southeast europe  west asia and north africa  becoming a major power in eurasia and africa during the early modern period  the empire reached the peak of its power in the 16th century  especially during the reign

inscriptions of the g xf6kt xfcrks  celestial turks  of central asia  c  8th century   27  the english name turkey first appeared in the late 14th century and is derived from medieval latin turchia  28   the greek cognate of this name  tourkia  greek  \u03a4\u03bf u03c5\u03c1\u03ba u03af u03b1  was used by the byzantine emperor and scholar constantine vii porphyrogenitus in his book de administrando imperio  29][30  though in his use   turks  always referred to magyars  31  similarly  the medieval khazar empire  a turkic state on the northern shores of the black and caspian seas  was referred to as tourkia  land of the turks  in byzantine sources  32  the medieval arabs referred to the mamluk sultanate as al-dawla al-turkiyya  state of turkey   33][34  the ottoman empire was sometimes referred to as turkey or the turkish empire among its european contemporaries  35   the anatolian peninsula  comprising most of modern turkey  is one of the oldest permanently settled regions in the world  various ancient anatolian populations have lived in anatolia  from at least the neolithic period until the hellenistic period  14  many of these peoples spoke the anatolian languages  a branch of the larger indo-european language family  38  in fact  given the antiquity of the indo-european hittite and luwian languages  some scholars have proposed anatolia as the hypothetical centre from which the indo-european languages radiated  39  the european part of turkey  called eastern thrace  has also been inhabited since at least forty thousand years ago  and is known to have been in the neolithic era by about 6000 bc  15   g xf6bekli tepe is the site of the oldest known man-made religious structure  a temple dating to circa 10,000 bc  36  while \xc7atalh

date and in july 2012 was inscribed as a unesco world heritage site  40  the settlement of troy started in the neolithic age and continued into the iron age  41   the earliest recorded inhabitants of anatolia were the hattians and hurrians  non-indo-european peoples who inhabited central and eastern anatolia  respectively  as early as ca  2300 bc  indo-european hittites came to anatolia and gradually absorbed the hattians and hurrians ca  2000\u20131700 bc  the first major empire in the area was founded by the hittites  from the 18th through the 13th century bc  the assyrians conquered and settled parts of southeastern turkey as early as 1950 bc until the year 612 bc  42][43  urartu re-emerged in assyrian inscriptions in the 9th century bc as a powerful northern rival of assyria  44   following the collapse of the hittite empire c  1180 bc  the phrygians  an indo-european people  achieved ascendancy in anatolia until their kingdom was destroyed by the cimmerians in the 7th century bc  45  starting from 714\xa0bc  urartu shared the same fate and dissolved in 590 bc  46  when it was conquered by the medes  the most powerful of phrygia s successor states were lydia  caria and lycia   starting around 1200 bc  the coast of anatolia was heavily settled by aeolian and ionian greeks  numerous important cities were founded by these colonists  such as miletus  ephesus  smyrna  now \u0130zmir  and byzantium  now istanbul   the latter founded by greek colonists from megara in 657 bc  the first state that was called armenia by neighbouring peoples was the state of the armenian orontid dynasty  which included parts of eastern turkey beginning in the 6th century bc  in northwest turkey  the most significant tribal group in thrace was the odyrisians  founded by teres i  52   all of modern-day turkey was conquered by the persian achaemenid empire during the 6th century bc  53  the greco-persian wars started when the greek city states on the coast of anatolia rebelled against persian rule in 499 bc  the territory of turkey later fell to alexander the great in 334 bc  54  which led to increasing cultural homogeneity and hellenization in the area  14   following alexander s death in 323 bc  anatolia was subsequently divided into a number of small hellenistic kingdoms  all of which became part of the roman republic by the mid-1st century bc  55  the process of hellenization that began with alexander s conquest accelerated under roman rule  and by the early centuries of the christian era the local anatolian languages and cultures had become extinct  being largely replaced by ancient greek language and culture  16][56  from the 1st century bc up to the 3rd century ce  large parts of modern-day turkey were contested between the romans and neighbouring parthians through the frequent roman-parthian wars   in 324  constantine i chose byzantium to be the new capital of the roman empire  renaming it new rome  following the death of theodosius i in 395 and the permanent division of the roman empire between his two sons  the city  which would popularly come to be known as constantinople  became the capital of the eastern roman empire  this  which would later be branded by historians as the byzantine empire  ruled most of the territory of present-day turkey until the late middle ages  57  although the eastern regions remained in firm sasanian hands up to the first half of the seventh century  the frequent byzantine-sassanid wars  as part of the centuries long-lasting roman-persian wars  fought between the neighbouring rivalling byzantines and sasanians  took place in various parts of present-day turkey and decided much of the latter s history from the fourth century up to the first half of the seventh century   the house of seljuk was a branch of the k u0131n u0131k o u011fuz turks who resided on the periphery of the muslim world  in the yabgu khaganate of the o u011fuz confederacy  to the north of the caspian and aral seas  in the 9th century  61  in the 10th century  the seljuks started migrating from their ancestral homeland into persia  which became the administrative core of the great seljuk empire  62   in the latter half of the 11th century  the seljuk turks began penetrating into medieval armenia and the eastern regions of anatolia  in 1071  the seljuks defeated the byzantines at the battle of manzikert  starting the turkification process in the area  the turkish language and islam were introduced to armenia and anatolia  gradually spreading throughout the region  the slow transition from a predominantly christian and greek-speaking anatolia to a predominantly muslim and turkish-speaking one was underway  63  alongside the turkification of the territory  the culturally persianized seljuks set the basis for a turko-persian principal culture in anatolia  64  which their eventual successors  the ottomans would take over  65][66   in 1243  the seljuk armies were defeated by the mongols  causing the seljuk empire s power to slowly disintegrate  in its wake  one of the turkish principalities governed by osman i would  over the next 200 years  evolve into the ottoman empire  in 1453  the ottomans completed their conquest of the byzantine empire by capturing its capital  constantinople  67   in 1514  sultan selim i (1512\u20131520  successfully expanded the empire s southern and eastern borders by defeating shah ismail i of the safavid dynasty in the battle of chaldiran  in 1517  selim i expanded ottoman rule into algeria and egypt  and created a naval presence in the red sea  subsequently  a contest started between the ottoman and portuguese empires to become the dominant sea power in the indian ocean  with a number of naval battles in the red sea  the arabian sea and the persian gulf  the portuguese presence in the indian ocean was perceived as a threat for the ottoman monopoly over the ancient trade routes between east asia and western europe  despite the increasingly prominent european presence  the ottoman empire s trade with the east continued to flourish until the second half of the 18th century  70   the ottoman empire s power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries  particularly during the reign of suleiman the magnificent  who personally instituted major legislative changes relating to society  education  taxation and criminal law  the empire was often at odds with the holy roman empire in its steady advance towards central europe through the balkans and the southern part of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth  71  at sea  the ottoman navy contended with several holy leagues  such as those in 1538  1571  1684 and 1717  composed primarily of habsburg spain  the republic of genoa  the republic of venice  the knights of st  john  the papal states  the grand duchy of tuscany and the duchy of savoy   for the control of the mediterranean sea  in the east  the ottomans were often at war with safavid persia over conflicts stemming from territorial disputes or religious differences between the 16th and 18th centuries  72  the ottoman wars with persia continued as the zand  afsharid  and qajar dynasties succeeded the safavids in iran  until the first half of the 19th century  from the 16th to the early 20th centuries  the ottoman empire also fought many wars with the russian tsardom and empire  these were initially about ottoman territorial expansion and consolidation in southeastern and eastern europe  but starting from the latter half of the 18th century  they became more about the survival of the ottoman empire  which began to lose its strategic territories on the northern black sea coast to the advancing russians  between the 18th and the early 20th centuries  the ottoman  persian and russian empires were neighbouring rivals of each other   from the second half of the 18th century onwards  the ottoman empire began to decline  the tanzimat reforms of the 19th century aimed to modernise the ottoman state in line with the progress that was made in western europe  but these efforts proved to be inadequate in most fields  and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire  74  as it gradually shrank in size  military power and wealth  especially after the ottoman economic crisis and default in 1875[75  which led to uprisings in the balkan provinces that culminated into the russo-turkish war of 1877\u201378  many balkan muslims migrated to the empire s heartland in anatolia  76][77  along with the circassians fleeing the russian conquest of the caucasus  the decline of the ottoman empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among its various subject peoples  leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence  such as the hamidian massacres of armenians  78   the young turk revolution in 1908 restored the ottoman constitution and parliament 30 years after their suspension by sultan abd xfclhamid ii in 1878  but the 1913 ottoman coup d  xe9tat effectively put the country under the control of the three pashas  this made sultans mehmed v and mehmed vi largely symbolic figureheads with no real political power   the ottoman empire entered world war i on the side of the central powers and was ultimately defeated  during the war  the empire s armenians were deported to syria as part of the armenian genocide  as a result  an estimated 800,000 to 1,500,000 armenians were killed  79][80][81][82  the turkish government has refused to acknowledge the events as genocide and claims that armenians were only relocated from the eastern war zone  83  large-scale massacres were also committed against the empire s other minority groups such as the assyrians and greeks  84][85][86  following the armistice of mudros on 30 october 1918  the victorious allied powers sought to partition the ottoman state through the 1920 treaty of s xe8vres  67   the occupation of istanbul and izmir by the allies in the aftermath of world war i prompted the establishment of the turkish national movement  under the leadership of mustafa kemal pasha  a military commander who had distinguished himself during the battle of gallipoli  the turkish war of independence was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the treaty of s xe8vres  87   by 18 september 1922 the occupying armies were expelled  88  and the ankara-based turkish regime  which had declared itself the legitimate government of the country on 23 april 1920  started to formalise the legal transition from the old ottoman into the new republican political system  on 1 november 1922  the turkish parliament in ankara formally abolished the sultanate  thus ending 623 years of monarchical ottoman rule  the treaty of lausanne of 24 july 1923 led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the newly formed  republic of turkey  as the successor state of the ottoman empire  and the republic was officially proclaimed on 29 october 1923 in ankara  the country s new capital  89  the lausanne convention stipulated a population exchange between greece and turkey  whereby 1.1 million greeks left turkey for greece in exchange for 380,000 muslims transferred from greece to turkey  90   mustafa kemal became the republic s first president and subsequently introduced many radical reforms with the aim of transforming the old religion-based and multi-communal ottoman state system  constitutional monarchy  into an essentially turkish nation state  parliamentary republic  with a secular constitution  91  with the surname law of 1934  the turkish parliament bestowed upon mustafa kemal the honorific surname  atat xfcrk   father of the turks   87   \u0130smet \u0130n xf6n xfc became turkey s second president following atat xfcrk s death

centralised structure of decision-making in ankara is considered by some academicians as an impediment to good local governance  107][108  and occasionally causes resentment in the municipalities of urban centres that are inhabited largely by ethnic minority groups  such as the kurds  109][110][111  steps towards decentralisation since 2004 have proven to be a highly controversial topic in turkey  107][108  the efforts to decentralise the administrative structure are also driven by the european charter of local self-government and with chapter 22   regional policy  amp  coordination of

a continuation of both greco-roman and islamic cultures  and western culture and traditions  which started with the westernisation of the ottoman empire and still continues today  this mix originally began as a result of the encounter of turks and their culture with those of the peoples who were in their path during their migration from central asia to the west  370][371  turkish culture is a product of efforts to be a  modern  western state  while maintaining traditional religious and historical values  370   turkish painting  in the western sense  developed actively starting from the mid 19th century  the very first painting lessons were scheduled at what is now the istanbul technical university  then the imperial military engineering school  in 1793  mostly for technical purposes  372  in the late 19th century  human figure in the western sense was being established in turkish painting  especially with osman hamdi bey  impressionism  among the contemporary trends  appeared

art form  which can be linked to the persian miniature tradition  as well as strong chinese artistic influences  the words taswir or nakish were used to define the art of miniature painting in ottoman turkish  the studios the artists worked in were called nakkashanes  376  the miniatures were usually not signed  perhaps because of the rejection of individualism  but also because the works were not created entirely by one person  the head painter designed the composition of the scene  and his apprentices drew the contours  which were called tahrir  with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating an illusion of third dimension  the head painter  and much more often the scribe of the text  were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts  the understanding of perspective was different from that of the nearby european renaissance painting tradition  and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture  they followed closely

islamic and european traditions in modern-day turkish music and literary arts  380  turkish literature was heavily influenced by persian and arabic literature during most of the ottoman era  the tanzimat reforms introduced previously unknown western genres  primarily the novel and the short story  many of the writers in the tanzimat period wrote in several genres simultaneously  for instance  the poet n xe2m u0131k kemal also wrote the important 1876 novel \u0130ntib xe2h  awakening   while the journalist \u015einasi is noted for writing  in 1860  the first modern turkish play  the one-act comedy "\u015eair evlenmesi   the poet s marriage   most of the roots of modern turkish literature were formed between the years 1896 and 1923  broadly  there were three primary literary movements during this period  the edebiyat- u0131 ced xeede  new literature  movement  the fecr-i \xc2t xee  dawn of the future  movement  and the mill xee edebiyat  national literature  movement  the first

music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated  these rituals later became theatrical shows  in the 10th century  a blend of traditions occurred between the seljuk turks and those of the inhabitants of anatolia  the interaction between the various tribal societies paved the way for new plays  after the tanzimat  reformation  period  characters in turkish theatre were modernized and plays were performed on european-style stages with the actors wearing european costumes  following the declaration of the second constitutional monarchy in 1908  theatrical activities increased and social problems began to be reflected in the theatre as well as in historical plays  a theatrical conservatoire  dar

playwrights emerged  some wrote on romantic subjects  others were interested in social problems and still others dealt with nationalistic themes  there were even those who wrote musicals  in time  turkish ladies began to appear on stage and this was indeed a revolution of the time  since female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of turkey u2019s ethnic minorities  today

influences ranging from central asian folk music  arabic music  greek music  ottoman music  persian music and balkan music  as well as references to more modern european and american popular music  the roots of traditional music in turkey span across centuries to a time when the seljuk turks migrated to anatolia and persia in the 11th century and contains elements of both turkic and pre-turkic influences  much of its modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the early 1930s drive for westernization  383   with the assimilation of immigrants from various regions the diversity of musical genres and musical instrumentation also expanded  turkey has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of greek  armenian  albanian  polish and jewish communities  among others  384   many turkish cities and towns have vibrant local music scenes which  in turn  support a number of regional musical styles  despite this however  western-style music styles like pop music and kanto lost popularity to arabesque in the late 70s and 80s  it became popular again by the beginning of the 1990s  as a result of an opening economy and society  with the support of sezen aksu  the resurging popularity of pop music gave rise to several international turkish pop stars such as tarkan and sertab erener  the late 1990s also saw an emergence of underground music producing alternative turkish rock  electronica  hip-hop  rap and dance music in opposition to the mainstream corporate pop and arabesque genres  which many believe have become too commercial  385   turkey has a diverse folkloric dance culture  hora is performed in east thrace  zeybek in the aegean region  southern marmara and east-central anatolia region  teke in the

ottoman architecture is most visible in bursa  which was the capital of the ottoman state between 1335 and 1413  following the ottoman conquest of constantinople  istanbul  in 1453  ottoman

at least 374 buildings which were constructed in various provinces of the ottoman empire in the 16th century  388   since the 18th century  turkish architecture has been increasingly influenced by
