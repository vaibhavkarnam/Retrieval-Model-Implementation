WindpowerinDenmark
 denmark was a pioneer in developing commercial wind power during the 1970s  and today a substantial share of the wind turbines around the world are produced by danish manufacturers such as vestas and siemens wind power along with many component suppliers  wind power produced the equivalent of 42.1  of denmark s total electricity consumption in 2015,[1][2  increased from 33  in 2013  and 39  in 2014.[3][4][5  in 2012 the danish government adopted a plan to increase the share of electricity production from wind to 50  by 2020,[6  and to 84  in 2035.[7  denmark had the 6th best energy security in the world in 2014.[8       danish inventor poul la cour experimented  taught and constructed wind power subjects around the year 1900.[9][10   as concerns over global warming grew in the 1980s  denmark found itself with relatively high carbon dioxide emissions per capita  primarily due to the coal-fired electrical power plants that had become the norm after the 1973 and 1979 energy crises  11  renewable energy became the natural choice for denmark  decreasing both dependence on other countries for energy and global warming pollution   many countries tried to subsidize green technology such as wind power  and most failed to make a viable industry  the danish system was an exception  providing 30  of initial capital cost in the early years which was gradually reduced to zero  but still maintaining a feed-in tariff  12  the capital cost subsidy was reduced to 20  in june 1985  when wind turbines received dkk 50 million per year  other renewable energy forms received 37 million  13  the research institution teknologisk institut identified many specific improvement needs  pushing development from ad hoc to systemized solutions  14   on 29 march 1985  one year before the chernobyl disaster  the danes passed a law forbidding the construction of nuclear power plants  in the process the danish grassroots movement had a substantial role  the danish anti-nuclear movement s  ooa  smiling-sun logo  atomkraft  nej tak    nuclear power  no thanks   spread worldwide  and the renewable alternatives were promoted by the danish organisation for renewable energy  ove    denmark adopted a target of cutting carbon emissions by 22  from 1988 levels by 2005.[11  planning of wind power was deliberately streamlined by authorities in order to minimize hurdles  15   denmark has relatively modest average wind speeds in the range of 4.9\u20135.6\xa0m s measured at 10\xa0m height  onshore wind resources are highest in the western part of the country  and on the eastern islands with coastlines facing south or west  the country has very large offshore wind resources  and large areas of sea territory with a shallow water depth of 5\u201315\xa0m  where siting is most feasible  these sites offer higher wind speeds  in the range of roughly 8.5\u20139.0\xa0m s at 50\xa0m height  16  there have been no major problems from wind variability  although there is a temporary problem resulting from the connection of a large bloc of wind power from offshore wind farms to a single point on a weak section of the transmission network  17  the wind resource over denmark was mapped in 1999 by emd international a s and ris xf8 national laboratory  the mapping was made using a 200\xa0m grid resolution using the models in windpro and wasp  the results were validated on more than 1200 wind turbines nationwide  18   denmark is connected by transmission line to other european countries  e g  cross-skagerrak  19  at an electricity interconnection level  transmission capacity relative to production capacity  of 44%.[20  denmark has also retained its traditional power plants  therefore it does not need to install additional peak-load plants to balance its wind power  instead  it purchases additional power from its neighbours when necessary  with some strengthening of the grid  denmark plans to increase wind s share even further 21  to 50  of consumption in 2020,[22  and up to 84  in 2035.[7   analysts expect the cost of wind power to be 30 \xf8re kwh and its handling cost to be 15 \xf8re kwh  being lower than coal and natural gas at 55 \xf8re kwh minimum  23  due to their inability to follow load wind power gets a lower price  24   danish district heating plants use 100 petajoule year  25  but little of this consumption is from 180mw of electrode boilers installed in powerplants or 37mw of large heat pumps  the boilers are only used to soak up the powerplant s own electricity when prices are negative  to avoid paying tax  26][27][28][29  expansion of wind powered district heating is calculated to be economically efficient without taxes  30][31][32   the number of household heat pumps has stalled at 70,000 in 2015 due to tax-free wood pellets  and the goal of 300,000 small heat pumps in 2035 is unlikely to be reached  reducing the value of more wind power unless electricity tax is reduced  33   at the end of 2015 update   denmark s capacity stood at 5,070\xa0mw   denmark has the highest proportion of wind power in the world  in 2015  denmark produced 42  of electricity from wind  1][2  up from the 2014 record of 39  of total power consumption  for the month of january 2014  that share was over 61   the month of lowest wind power share was july at 23%.[3  denmark also had 548\xa0mw of solar power 35  (790 mw in late 2015).[36  a peak generation period occurred on 21 december 2013 when the wind share was 102   and for 1 hour the share was 135%.[5   a report on denmark s wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1  of average demand on 54 days during 2002.[37   in 2005  denmark had installed wind capacity of 3,127\xa0mw  which produced 23,810\xa0tj (6.6\xa0tw xb7h  of energy  giving an actual average production of 755\xa0mw at a capacity factor of 24%.[38  in 2009  denmark s capacity grew to 3,482\xa0mw  most of the increase came from the 209\xa0mw horns rev 2 offshore wind farm  which was inaugurated on september xa017  2009 by crown prince frederik  39  in 2010  capacity grew to 3,752\xa0mw  and most of the year s increase came from the r xf8dsand-2 off-shore wind farm  in 2014  the largest increase came from the 400\xa0mw anholt wind farm  3   wind power output reduces spot market prices in general via the merit order effect  in 2008 this caused a net reduction of pre-tax electricity prices  balancing the increase from the feed-in law   40   the chart shows the minimum  guaranteed  price a plant receives during the flh period in \xf8re kwh  subsidy   guaranteed price minus market price  flh full load hours  the amount of production the plant receives support for  after that  the plant usually receives market price  transmission is included in the nearshore  vesterhav   but not the other plants  the levels are usually below levels in germany and uk  44][45][46][47][43   as denmark continues to install additional capacity  they continue to set new production records  this is a natural consequence of capacity growth  on july 9  2015  in the evening  unusually strong wind conditions resulted in 116  of national electricity consumption being produced by wind farms and at 3am the next morning at low demand  wind production exceeded 140  of current demand  2][48   on 22 march 2012 a coalition of parties representing 95  of all members of the danish parliament agreed that the danish state would increase the country s offshore wind capacity by 1,500\xa0mw  49][50  the 1,500\xa0mw extra capacity will be achieved by constructing the future offshore wind farms horns rev 3 with a capacity of 400\xa0mw in the north sea 50  at 77 \xf8re kwh 51  and kriegers flak at 37.2 \xf8re kwh 43  with a capacity of 600\xa0mw in the baltic sea close to the borders of germany and sweden  50  kriegers flak will also be used to connect denmark and germany with a 400mw cable  through the german baltic 2 offshore wind farm  52  and energinet ordered electrical equipment in early 2016.[53][54  horns rev 3 is set to be operational in 2019[55  while kriegers flak and all the nearshore wind farms are set to be fully operational 50][56  around 2021  eight groups applied for pre-qualification for kriegers flak  57  of which 7 were approved 58  - 3 more than the 4 companies approved to compete for horns rev 3,[59  both having more bidders than the single bidder for anholt   in addition 6 nearshore wind farms with a total capacity of up to 450\xa0mw will be constructed along with 50\xa0mw of experimental offshore wind farms  the nearshore differ from conventional offshore in having the being close enough to the coast to have the transformer on land  decreasing cost  50  the first 350\xa0mw were called for tenders in 2015  with a maximum price of 70 \xf8re kwh  60][61][62  vattenfall bid the lowest price for the 350 mw nearshore farms at 47,5 \xf8re kwh in september 2016,[63  but the politial situation was unclear  64   in addition to the offshore projects  a further 500\xa0mw additional net capacity of onshore windfarms is expected to be constructed until 2020  the 500\xa0mw of additional net capacity is the expected result of the scrapping of 1,300\xa0mw capacity from obsolete wind turbines combined with the simultaneous building of 1,800\xa0mw capacity of modern wind turbines \u2013 a process also known as repowering  65   annual wind power production is currently (2014  equal to about 39  of electricity consumed in denmark  2][3  the proportion of this that is actually consumed in denmark has been disputed  as the considerable hydropower resources of norway  and to some extent  sweden  is used as grid storage with low loss  hydropower can rapidly reduce generation whenever wind farms are generating power  saving water for later  and can export electricity to denmark when wind power output drops  short term  denmark imports electricity from norway during daytime and exports in nighttime  long term  denmark imports electricity in summer and exports in winter  wind is higher in autumn and winter  when consumption is also high  66  this service of timeshifting production and consumption is also found around the world in pumped-storage hydroelectricity balancing coal and nuclear plants   for timeshifting trade with norway  denmark exports at dkk 157 mwh and imports at dkk 212/mwh  32  the correlation is low between wind power in norway and denmark  66  market price sometimes falls to near or below zero  particularly in high winds and low consumption  67  in 2014  there were 46 hours with negative prices  costing dkk 37.7 million  68  in 2015  negative prices occurred in 65 hours in west denmark and 36 hours in east denmark - less than 1  of the time  danish prices are mainly negative when german prices are even more negative  the whole date of september 2 (2015  was the first time that no central power plants were running in west denmark  and grid stability was maintained by compensators  2   denmark is generally a transit country for electricity trade between the much larger markets in norway  sweden and germany  69][70  and plans to add cables to the netherlands  cobracable  and england  viking link  as well  further increasing the function of being a crossroads for electricity   claims of up to 40  of wind power being exported have been made  71][72  countered by claims that only 1  was exported  73   according to the first argument  power in excess of immediate demand is exported to neighbouring countries at lower prices  part of the benefit of this goes to denmark s northern neighbours  when denmark exports power  it is sold at the spot market price which must be lower than at the importing market in order to be transmitted   according to the second argument  the correlation between exports and wind power is weak  and a similar correlation exists with conventional thermal plants running partly for district heating  meanwhile  causal analysis shows that export from denmark typically occurs as a consequence of the merit order effect  when large thermal plants have reserve capacities at times the spot market price of electricity is high   in any case  the export price is the intermediate between the prices of the two areas  so the exporting tso  energinet  uses the profit to relieve tariffs 74  at around dkk 500 million per year  75  wind power organizations state that denmark exports power at a higher price than it imports at  76   the danish wind turbine industry is the world s largest  citation needed  around 90  of the national output is exported  and danish companies accounted for 38  of the world turbine market in 2003  when the industry employed some 20,000 people and had a turnover of around 3\xa0billion euro  77  the return of investment dropped from near 20  before the financial crisis  to 10  some years later  78][79  the danish wind turbine industry had a turnover of dkk 84 billion in 2014.[80   the biggest wind turbine manufacturers with production facilities in denmark are vestas and siemens wind power  citation needed   the development of wind power in denmark has been characterized by a close collaboration between publicly financed research and industry in key areas such as research and development  certification  testing  and the preparation of standards  81  for example  in the 1980s  a large number of small danish companies were developing wind turbines to sell to california  and the danish ris xf8 laboratory provided test facilities and certification procedures  these resulted in reliable products and the rapid expansion of the danish turbine manufacturing industry  82  components are tested at lorc in odense  and new large prototype turbines between 4-8 mw  including some non-danish ones  are being tested at \xd8sterild  limited production turbines  four siemens 7mw with 66kv cabling  are to be supported at nissum bredning at a cost of dkk 300m  partially financed by local people  83][84][85   how price of consumer electricity is composed 86   denmark s electricity costs  including pso  costs for cleaner energy  are average in the eu  87][88][89  but taxes increase the price to the highest in europe  90  the tax money is a considerable income for the state  and changing the composition of the taxes towards a  greener  mix is difficult  according to a government official  the majority of taxes are not based on environment concerns  91  in contrast to the dkk 5 billion per year in pso-money for cleaner energy  paid by electricity consumers to producers of clean electricity  these tolls are not available for government consumption  92   actual consumer-paid incentives  pso  to new wind turbines depend on year of commission  but is generally around 25 \xf8re (3.4 eurocent  per kwh for a limited amount of hours  although support is discounted if combined price exceeds 58 \xf8re kwh  pso is also used for biomass  solar  and district heating  total pso was dkk 5.8 billion in 2013  of which dkk 3.2 billion went to wind power  92  in 2015  the cost of power was only 32  of the price  while pso was 9   and tolls and vat the remaining 59%.[86   wind power displaces coal  oil and gas to some degree  reducing running cost for fossil fuels  consumption of coal was more than halved over 10 years  93  wind power reduces price variability slightly  94   in 2009  the institute for energy research commissioned the danish think-tank cepos  centre for political studies  to report on electricity exports from denmark and the economic impact of the danish wind industry  this heavily criticized report 95  states that danes pay the highest residential electricity rates in the european union  mostly for government revenue  but partly to subsidize wind power   and that the cost of saving a ton of carbon dioxide between 2001 and 2008 has averaged 647 dkk (\u20ac87  us 124   it also estimated that 90  of wind industry jobs were transferred from other technology industries  and states that as a result danish gdp is 1.8\xa0billion dkk (us 270\xa0million  lower than it would have been without wind industry subsidies of 1.7-2.6 billion dkk  roughly $320m - $480m  yearly in 2001-2005  the report was later heavily criticised  firstly danish engineering magazine ingeni xf8ren claimed that the report was ordered and paid for by the american oil and coal lobby through ier  96  later  several danish researchers and professors from all technical universities in denmark  wrote a joint response to the report  refuting it  97  the report from cepos was even brought to government level  where minister of climate and energy lykke friis discredited the work done by cepos and the report  98  the world nuclear association estimates that the report was ier s response to us president obama s 2009 earth day speech in newton  iowa claiming that usa could generate 20  of its electricity from wind by 2030  as denmark already was  99][100   to encourage investment in wind power  families were offered a tax exemption for generating their own electricity within their own or an adjoining municipality  101  while this could involve purchasing a turbine outright  more often families purchased shares in wind turbine cooperatives which in turn invested in community wind turbines  by 1996 there were around 2,100 such cooperatives in the country  101  opinion polls show that this direct involvement has helped the popularity of wind turbines  with some 86  of danes supporting wind energy when compared with existing fuel sources  77   the role of wind turbine cooperatives is not limited to single turbines  the middelgrunden offshore wind farm \u2013 with 20\xa0turbines the world s largest offshore farm at the time it was built in 2000 \u2013 is 50  owned by the 10,000 investors in the middelgrunden wind turbine cooperative  and 50  by the municipal utility company  102  as is the aved xf8re near-shore turbines   by 2001 over 100,000 families belonged to wind turbine cooperatives  which had installed 86  of all the wind turbines in denmark  103  by 2004 over 150,000 were either members or owned turbines  and about 5,500 turbines had been installed  although with greater private sector involvement the proportion owned by cooperatives had fallen to 75%.[77  the cooperative model has also spread to germany and the netherlands   the island of sams xf8 erected 11 one-megawatt  land-based wind turbines in 2000  followed by ten offshore 2.3\xa0mw wind turbines completed in 2003  together with other renewable energy measures  this community of 4,200 achieved fame  104  claiming that it is the largest carbon-neutral settlement on the planet  105  not in
