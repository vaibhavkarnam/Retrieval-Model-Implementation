Energysubsidies
 energy subsidies are measures that keep prices for consumers below market levels or for producers above market levels  or reduce costs for consumers and producers  1  energy subsidies may be direct cash transfers to producers  consumers  or related bodies  as well as indirect support mechanisms  such as tax exemptions and rebates  price controls  trade restrictions  and limits on market access  they may also include energy conservation subsidies  2  the development of today s major modern energy industries have all relied on substantial subsidy support   global fossil fuel subsidies represented 6.5  of global gdp in 2015.[3  the elimination of these subsidies is widely seen as one of the most effective ways of reducing global carbon emissions  3][4][5       main arguments for energy subsidies are   main arguments against energy subsidies are   types of energy subsidies are   overall  energy subsidies require coordination and integrated implementation  especially in light of globalization and increased interconnectedness of energy policies  thus their regulation at the world trade organization is often seen as necessary  11][12   a 2016 study estimated that global fossil fuel subsidies were $5.3 trillion in 2015  which represents 6.5  of global gdp  3  the study found that  china was the biggest subsidizer in 2013 ($1.8 trillion   followed by the united states ($0.6 trillion   and russia  the european union  and india  each with about $0.3 trillion    3  the authors estimated that the elimination of  subsidies would have reduced global carbon emissions in 2013 by 21  and fossil fuel air pollution deaths 55   while raising revenue of 4   and social welfare by 2.2   of global gdp   3  according to the international energy agency  the elimination of fossil fuel subsidies worldwide would be the one of the most effective ways of reducing greenhouse gases and battling global warming  4  in may 2016  the g7 nations set for the first time a deadline for ending most fossil fuel subsidies  saying government support for coal  oil and gas should end by 2025.[13   according to the oecd  subsidies supporting fossil fuels  particularly coal and oil  represent greater threats to the environment than subsidies to renewable energy  subsidies to nuclear power contribute to unique environmental and safety issues  related mostly to the risk of high-level environmental damage  although nuclear power contributes positively to the environment in the areas of air pollution and climate change  14  according to fatih birol  chief economist at the international energy agency without a phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies  countries will not reach their climate targets  15   a 2010 study by global subsidies initiative compared global relative subsidies of different energy sources  results show that fossil fuels receive 0.8 us cents per kwh of energy they produce  although it should be noted that the estimate of fossil fuel subsidies applies only to consumer subsidies and only within non-oecd countries   nuclear energy receives 1.7 cents   kwh  renewable energy  excluding hydroelectricity  receives 5.0 cents   kwh and bio-fuels receive 5.1 cents   kwh in subsidies  16   in 2011  iea chief economist faith birol said the current $409 billion equivalent of fossil fuel subsidies are encouraging a wasteful use of energy  and that the cuts in subsidies is the biggest policy item that would help renewable energies get more market share and reduce co2 emissions  17   global renewable energy subsidies reached $88 billion in 2011.[18  according to the oecd  subsidies to renewable energy are generally considered more environmentally beneficial than fossil fuel subsidies  although the full range of environmental effects should to be taken into account  14   according to international energy agency  iea  (2011  energy subsidies artificially lower the price of energy paid by consumers  raise the price received by producers or lower the cost of production   fossil fuels subsidies costs generally outweigh the benefits  subsidies to renewables and low-carbon energy technologies can bring long-term economic and environmental benefits   19  in november 2011  an iea report entitled deploying renewables 2011 said  subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits   the iea s report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand   a portfolio of renewable energy technologies is becoming cost-competitive in an increasingly broad range of circumstances  in some cases providing investment opportunities without the need for specific economic support   the iea said  and added that  cost reductions in critical technologies  such as wind and solar  are set to continue   20   fossil-fuel consumption subsidies were $409 billion in 2010  oil products being half of it  renewable-energy subsidies were $66 billion in 2010 and will reach $250 billion by 2035  according to iea  renewable energy is subsidized in order to compete in the market  increase their volume and develop the technology so that the subsidies become unnecessary with the development  eliminating fossil-fuel subsidies could bring economic and environmental benefits  phasing out fossil-fuel subsidies by 2020 would cut primary energy demand 5   since the start of 2010  at least 15 countries have taken steps to phase out fossil-fuel subsidies  according to iea onshore wind may become competitive around 2020 in the european union  19   according to the iea the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies  over $500 billion annually  will reduce 10  greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.[21   the international energy agency estimates that governments subsidised fossil fuels by us $548 billion in 2013.[22  ten countries accounted for almost three-quarters of this figure  23  at their meeting in september 2009 the g-20 countries committed to  rationalize and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption   24  the 2010s have seen many countries reducing energy subsidies  for instance in july 2014 ghana abolished all diesel and gasoline subsidies  whilst in the same month egypt raised diesel prices 63  as part of a raft of reforms intended to remove subsidies within 5 years  25   the public energy subsidies for energy in finland in 2013 were \u20ac700 million for fossil energy and \u20ac60 million for renewable energy  mainly wood and wind   26   on march 13  2013  terry m  dinan  senior advisor at the congressional budget office  testified before the subcommittee on energy of the committee on science  space  and technology in the u s  house of representatives that federal energy tax subsidies would cost $16.4 billion that fiscal year  broken down as follows   in addition  dinan testified that the u s  department of energy would spend an additional $3.4 billion on financial support for energy technologies and energy efficiency  broken down as follows   a 2011 study by the consulting firm management information services  inc  (misi  28  estimated the total historical federal subsidies for various energy sources over the years 1950\u20132010  the study found that oil  natural gas  and coal received $369 billion  $121 billion  and $104 billion (2010 dollars   respectively  or 70  of total energy subsidies over that period  oil  natural gas  and coal benefited most from percentage depletion allowances and other tax-based subsidies  but oil also benefited heavily from regulatory subsidies such as exemptions from price controls and higher-than-average rates of return allowed on oil pipelines  the misi report found that non-hydro renewable energy  primarily wind and solar  benefited from $74 billion in federal subsidies  or 9  of the total  largely in the form of tax policy and direct federal expenditures on research and development  r amp d   nuclear power benefited from $73 billion in federal subsidies  9  of the total  largely in the form of r amp d  while hydro power received $90 billion in federal subsidies  12  of the total   a 2009 study by the environmental law institute 29  assessed the size and structure of u s  energy subsidies in 2002\u201308  the study estimated that subsidies to fossil fuel-based sources totaled about $72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totaled $29 billion  the study did not assess subsidies supporting nuclear energy   the three largest fossil fuel subsidies were   the three largest renewable fuel subsidies were   in the united states  the federal government has paid us 74 billion for energy subsidies to support r amp d for nuclear power ($50 billion  and fossil fuels ($24 billion  from 1973 to 2003  during this same timeframe  renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of us $26 billion  it has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help to level the playing field and support growing energy sectors  namely solar power  wind power  and bio-fuels  30  however  many of the  subsidies  available to the oil and gas industries are general business opportunity credits  available to all us businesses  particularly  the foreign tax credit mentioned above   the value of industry-specific  oil  gas  and coal  subsidies in 2006 was estimated by the texas state comptroller to be $6.25 billion - about 60  of the amount calculated by the environmental law institute  31  the balance of federal subsides  which the comptroller valued at $7.4 billion  came from shared credits and deductions  and oil defense  spending on the strategic petroleum reserve  energy infrastructure security  etc     critics allege that the most important subsidies to the nuclear industry have not involved cash payments  but rather the shifting of construction costs and operating risks from investors to taxpayers and ratepayers  burdening them with an array of risks including cost overruns  defaults to accidents  and nuclear waste management  critics claim that this approach distorts market choices  which they believe would otherwise favor less risky energy investments  32   many energy analysts  such as clint wilder  ron pernick and lester brown  have suggested that energy subsidies need to be shifted away from mature and established industries and towards high growth clean energy  they also suggest that such subsidies need to be reliable  long-term and consistent  to avoid the periodic difficulties that the wind industry has had in the united states  30][33   a 2012 study authored by researchers at the breakthrough institute  brookings institution  and world resources institute 34  estimated that between 2009 and 2014 the federal government will spend $150 billion on clean energy through a combination of direct spending and tax expenditures  renewable electricity  mainly wind  solar  geothermal  hydro  and tidal energy  will account for the largest share of this expenditure  32.1   while spending on liquid biofuels will account for the next largest share  16.1   spending on multiple and other forms of clean energy  including energy efficiency  electric vehicles and advanced batteries  high-speed rail  grid and transportation electrification  nuclear  and advanced fossil fuel technologies  will account for the remaining share  51.8   moreover  the report finds that absent federal action  spending on clean energy will decline by 75   from $44.3 billion in 2009 to $11.0 billion in 2014   from civilian nuclear power to hydro  wind  solar  and shale gas  the united states federal government has played a central role in the development of new energy industries  35   america s nuclear power industry  which currently supplies about 20  of the country s electricity  has its origins in the manhattan project to develop atomic weapons during world war ii  from 1942 to 1945  the united states invested $20 billion (2003 dollars  into a massive nuclear research and deployment initiative  but the achievement of the first nuclear weapon test in 1945 marked the beginning  not the end  of federal involvement in nuclear technologies  president dwight d  eisenhower s \u201catoms for peace u201d address in 1953 and the 1954 atomic energy act committed the united states to develop peaceful uses for nuclear technology  including commercial energy generation  the new national laboratory system  established by the manhattan project  was maintained and expanded  and the government poured money into nuclear energy research and development  36  recognizing that research was not sufficient to spur the development of a nascent  capital-intensive industry  the federal government created financial incentives to spur the deployment of nuclear energy  for example  the 1957 price anderson act limited the liability of nuclear energy firms in case of serious accident and helped firms secure capital with federal loan guarantees  in the favorable environment created by such incentives  more than 100 nuclear plants were built in the united states by 1973.[36   commercial wind power  today one of the fastest growing energy sectors  was also enabled through government support  in the 1980 s  the federal government pursued two different r amp d efforts for wind turbine development  the first was a \u201cbig science u201d effort by nasa and the department of energy  doe  to use u s  expertise in high-technology research and products to develop new large-scale wind turbines for electricity generation  largely from scratch  37  a second  more successful r amp d effort  sponsored by the doe  focused on component innovations for smaller turbines that used the operational experience of existing turbines to inform future research agendas  joint research projects between the government and private firms produced a number of innovations that helped increase the efficiency of wind turbines  including twisted blades and special-purpose airfoils  publicly funded r amp d was coupled with efforts to build a domestic market for new turbines  at the federal level  this included tax credits and the passage of the public utilities regulatory policy act  purpa   which required that utilities purchase power from some small renewable energy generators at avoided cost  37  both federal and state support for wind turbine development helped drive costs down considerably  but policy incentives at both the federal and state level were discontinued at the end of the decade  37  however  after a nearly five-year federal policy hiatus in the late 1980 s  the u s  government enacted new policies to support the industry in the early 1990 s  the national renewable energy laboratory  nrel  continued its support for wind turbine r amp d  and also launched the advanced wind turbine program  awtp   the goal of the awtp was to reduce the cost of wind power to rates that would be competitive in the u s  market  policymakers also introduced new mechanisms to spur the demand of new wind turbines and boost the domestic market  including a 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour tax credit  adjusted over time for inflation  included in the 1992 energy policy act  today the wind industry s main subsidy support comes from the federal production tax credit   the development of commercial solar power was also dependent on government support  solar pv technology was born in the united states  when daryl chapin  calvin fuller  and gerald pearson at bell labs first demonstrated the silicon solar photovoltaic cell in 1954.[38  the first cells recorded efficiencies of four percent  far lower than the 25 percent efficiencies typical of some silicon crystalline cells today  with the cost out of reach for most applications  developers of the new technology had to look elsewhere for an early market  as it turned out  solar pv did make economic sense in one market segment  aerospace  the united states army and air force viewed the technology as an ideal power source for a top-secret project on earth-orbiting satellites  the government contracted with hoffman electronics to provide solar cells for its new space exploration program  the first commercial satellite  the vanguard i  launched in 1958  was equipped with both silicon solar cells and chemical batteries  38  by 1965  nasa was using almost a million solar pv cells  strong government demand and early research support for solar cells paid off in the form of dramatic declines in the cost of the technology and improvements in its performance  from 1956 to 1973  the price of pv cells declined from $300 to $20 per watt  38  beginning in the 1970s  as costs were declining  manufacturers began producing solar pv cells for terrestrial applications  solar pv found a new niche in areas distant from power lines where electricity was needed  such as oil rigs and coast guard lighthouses  the government continued to support the industry through the 1970s and early 1980s with new r amp d efforts under presidents richard nixon and gerald ford  both republicans  and president jimmy carter  a democrat  as a direct result of government involvement in solar pv development  13 of the 14 top innovations in pv over the past three decades were developed with the help of federal dollars  nine of which were fully funded by the public sector  39   more recently than nuclear  wind  or solar  the development of the shale gas industry and subsequent boom in shale gas development in the united states was enabled through government support  40][41  the history of shale gas fracking in the united states was punctuated by the successive developments of massive hydraulic fracturing  mhf   microseismic imaging  horizontal drilling  and other key innovations that when combined made the once unreachable energy resource technically recoverable  along each stage of the innovation pipeline xa0\u2013 from basic research to applied r amp d to cost-sharing on demonstration projects to tax policy support for deployment xa0\u2013 public-private partnerships and federal investments helped push hydraulic fracturing in shale into full commercial competitiveness  through a combination of federally funded geologic research beginning in the 1970s  public-private collaboration on demonstration project and r amp d priorities  and tax policy support for unconventional technologies  the federal government played a key role in the development of shale gas in the united states   investigations have uncovered the crucial role of the government in the development of other energy technologies and industries  including aviation and jet engines  synthetic fuels  35  advanced natural gas turbines  42  and advanced diesel internal combustion engines  43   in venezuela  the subsidizing of fossil fuels has caused the creation of a huge black market  criminal groups smuggle fuel over the border  mainly to colombia   this is due to the large profits that can be gained by this act  as fuel is much more expensive in colombia than in venezuela  despite the fact that this issue is already well known in venezuela  and insecurity in the region continues to rise  the state has not yet raised or eliminated these fossil fuel subsidies  44][45][46][47
