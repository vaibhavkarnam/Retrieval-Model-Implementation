Carbonicacid
 carbonic acid is a chemical compound with the chemical formula h2co3  equivalently oc oh 2   it is also a name sometimes given to solutions of carbon dioxide in water  carbonated water   because such solutions contain small amounts of h2co3  in physiology  carbonic acid is described as volatile acid or respiratory acid  because it is the only acid excreted as a gas by the lungs  2  it plays an important role in the bicarbonate buffer system to maintain acid u2013base homeostasis   carbonic acid  which is a weak acid  forms two kinds of salts  the carbonates and the bicarbonates  in geology  carbonic acid causes limestone to dissolve producing calcium bicarbonate which leads to many limestone features such as stalactites and stalagmites   it was long believed that carbonic acid could not exist as a pure compound  however  in 1991 it was reported that nasa scientists had succeeded in making solid h2co3 samples  3       when carbon dioxide dissolves in water it exists in chemical equilibrium producing carbonic acid  4   the hydration equilibrium constant at 25\xa0\xb0c is called kh  which in the case of carbonic acid is [h2co3]/[co2  \u2248 1.7\xd710\u22123 in pure water 5  and \u2248 1.2\xd710\u22123 in seawater  6  hence  the majority of the carbon dioxide is not converted into carbonic acid  remaining as co2 molecules  in the absence of a catalyst  the equilibrium is reached quite slowly  the rate constants are 0.039\xa0s u22121 for the forward reaction (co2\xa0+\xa0h2o xa0\u2192 h2co3  and 23\xa0s u22121 for the reverse reaction (h2co3\xa0\u2192 co2\xa0  h2o   the addition of two molecules of water to co2 would give orthocarbonic acid  c oh 4  which exists only in minute amounts in aqueous solution   addition of base to an excess of carbonic acid gives bicarbonate  hydrogen carbonate   with excess base  carbonic acid reacts to give carbonate salts   bicarbonate is an intermediate in the transport of co2 out of the body via respiratory gas exchange  the hydration reaction of co2 is generally very slow in the absence of a catalyst  but red blood cells contain carbonic anhydrase  which increases the reaction rate  producing bicarbonate (hco3\u2212  dissolved in the blood plasma  this catalysed reaction is reversed in the lungs  where it converts the bicarbonate back into co2 and allows it to be expelled  this equilibration plays an important role as a buffer in mammalian blood  7  a 2016 theoretical report suggests that carbonic acid may play a pivotal role in protonating various nitrogen bases in blood serum  8   the oceans of the world have absorbed almost half of the co2 emitted by humans from the burning of fossil fuels  9]\xa0 it has been theorized that the extra dissolved carbon dioxide has caused the ocean s average surface ph to shift by about \u22120.1 unit from pre-industrial levels  this theory is known as ocean acidification  even though the ocean remains basic  10   carbonic acid is a polyprotic acid \u2014 specifically it is diprotic meaning it has two protons which may dissociate from the parent molecule  thus  there are two dissociation constants  the first one for the dissociation into the bicarbonate  also called hydrogen carbonate  ion hco3\u2212   care must be taken when quoting and using the first dissociation constant of carbonic acid  in aqueous solution  carbonic acid exists in equilibrium with carbon dioxide  and the concentration of h2co3 is much lower than the concentration of co2  in many analyses  h2co3 includes dissolved co2  referred to as co2 aq    h2co3  is used to represent the two species when writing the aqueous chemical equilibrium equation  the equation may be rewritten as follows  4   whereas this apparent pka is quoted as the dissociation constant of carbonic acid  it is ambiguous  it might better be referred to as the acidity constant of dissolved carbon dioxide  as it is particularly useful for calculating the ph of co2-containing solutions  a similar situation applies to sulfurous acid (h2so3   which exists in equilibrium with substantial amounts of unhydrated sulfur dioxide   the second constant is for the dissociation of the bicarbonate ion into the carbonate ion co32\u2212   the three acidity constants are defined as follows  \n n n n nk n na n1\n n n  n n n n  n n nh n n n  n n n  n  n n nhco n n n3\n n n u2212\n n n  n n n  n n nh

specific problem  resulting in the following very precise analytical expression for  h     it was long believed that carbonic acid could not exist as a pure compound  however  in 1991 scientists at nasa s goddard space flight center  usa  succeeded in making solid h2co3 samples  3  they did so by exposing a frozen mixture of water and carbon dioxide to high-energy proton radiation  and then warming to remove the excess water  the carbonic acid that remained was characterized by infrared spectroscopy  the fact that the carbonic acid was prepared by irradiating a solid h2o   co2 mixture  or even by irradiation of dry ice alone  has given rise to suggestions that h2co3 might be found in outer space or on mars  where frozen ices of h2o and co2 are found  as well as cosmic rays  11][12  it was announced in 1993 that solid carbonic acid had been created by a cryogenic reaction of potassium bicarbonate and hcl dissolved in methanol  13][14  later work showed that in fact the methyl ester had been formed  but other methods were successful  12  theoretical calculations showed that a single molecule of water can catalyze the decomposition of a gas-phase carbonic acid molecule to carbon dioxide and water  in the absence of water  the dissociation of gaseous carbonic acid has been predicted to be very slow  with a half-life of 180,000 years  11  this only applies if the molecules are few and far between  because it has also been predicted that gas-phase carbonic acid will catalyze its own decomposition by forming dimers which then break apart into two molecules each of water and carbon dioxide  15   for a while it was thought that there were two polymorphs of solid carbonic acid  called \u03b1 and \u03b2  the polymorph denoted beta-carbonic acid was prepared by heating alternating layers of glassy aqueous solutions of bicarbonate and acid in vacuum  which causes protonation of the bicarbonate  followed by removal of the solvent  the previously suggested alpha-carbonic acid  which was prepared by the same technique using methanol rather than water as a solvent was later shown to be a monomethyl ester ch3ocooh  12
