territories in the caribbean  nb 1  the european part of the netherlands borders germany to the east  belgium to the south  and the north sea to the northwest  sharing maritime borders with belgium  the united kingdom  and germany  9  nthe three largest cities in the netherlands are amsterdam  rotterdam and the hague  amsterdam is the country s capital  10  while the hague holds the dutch seat of parliament and government  11  the port of rotterdam is the world s largest port outside east-asia  and by far the largest port in europe  12  nthe name holland is used informally to refer to the whole of the country of the netherlands  nb 2    netherlands  literally means  lower countries   influenced by its low land and flat geography  with only about 50  of its land exceeding one metre above sea level  13  most of the areas below sea level are man-made  since the late 16th century  large areas  polders  have been reclaimed from the sea and lakes  amounting to nearly 17  of the country s current land mass  with a population density of 412 people per km2 \u2013 507  january 2017  if water is excluded \u2013 the netherlands is classified as a very densely populated country  only bangladesh  south korea  and taiwan have both a larger population and higher population density  nevertheless  the netherlands is the world s second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products  after the united states  14][15  this is partly due to the fertility of the soil and the mild climate  the netherlands was the third country in the world to have an elected parliament  and since 1848 it has been governed as a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy  organised as a unitary state  the netherlands has a long history of social tolerance and is generally regarded as a liberal country  having legalised abortion  prostitution and euthanasia  while maintaining a progressive drugs policy  in 2001  it became the world s first country to legalise same-sex marriage   the netherlands is a founding member of the eu  eurozone  g-10  nato  oecd and wto  as well as being a part of the schengen area and the trilateral benelux union  the country is host to the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons and five international courts  the permanent court of arbitration  the international court of justice  the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia  the international criminal court and the special tribunal for lebanon  the first four are situated in the hague  as is the eu s criminal intelligence agency europol and judicial co-operation agency eurojust  this has led to the city being dubbed  the world s legal capital   16  the country also ranks second highest in the world s 2016 press freedom index  as published by reporters without borders  17   the netherlands has a market-based mixed economy  ranking 17th of 177 countries according to the index of economic freedom  18  it had the thirteenth-highest per capita income in the world in 2013 according to the international monetary fund  in 2013  the united nations world happiness report ranked the netherlands as the seventh-happiest country in the world  reflecting its high quality of life  19  the netherlands also ranks second highest in the inequality-adjusted human development index       the netherlands in its entirety is often referred to by the much older designation  holland   meaning holt land  or wood land   though this refers only to north and south holland  two of the nation s twelve provinces  formerly a single province and earlier the county of holland  this originally frankish county emerged from the dissolved frisian kingdom and was \u2013 after the decline of duchy of brabant and county of flanders \u2013 economically and politically the most important county in the low countries region  because of this importance  and the emphasis on holland during the formation of the dutch republic  the eighty years  war and later the anglo-dutch wars in the 16th  17th and 18th century  holland served as a pars pro toto for the entire country  and is nowadays considered either incorrect  20][21  informal  22  or on occasion opprobrious  depending on the context  but is widely used when referring to the national football team  23   the  region  called low countries  comprising belgium  the netherlands and luxembourg  and the  country  of the netherlands have the same toponymy  place names with neder  or lage   nieder  nether  or low  and nedre  in germanic languages  and bas or inferior  in romance languages  are in use in places all over europe  they are sometimes used in a deictic relation to a higher ground that consecutively is indicated as upper  boven  oben  superior or haut  in the case of the low countries   the netherlands the geographical location of the lower region has been more or less downstream and near the sea  the geographical location of the upper region  however  changed over time tremendously  the romans made a distinction between the roman provinces of downstream germania inferior  nowadays part of belgium and the netherlands  and upstream germania superior  nowadays part of germany   the designation  low  to refer to the region returns again in the 10th century duchy of lower lorraine  that covered much of the low countries  24][25  but this time the corresponding upper region is upper lorraine  in nowadays northern france   the dukes of burgundy  who ruled the low countries in the 15th century  used the term les pays de par de xe7\xe0    the lands over here  for the low countries as opposed to les pays de par del xe0    the lands over there  for their original homeland  burgundy in present-day east-central france  26  under habsburg rule  les pays de par de xe7\xe0 developed in pays d embas  lands down-here   27  a deictic expression in relation to other habsburg possessions in europe  this was translated as neder-landen in contemporary dutch official documents  28  from a regional point of view  niderlant was also the area between the meuse and the lower rhine in the late middle ages  the area known as oberland  high country  was in this deictic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located cologne   from the mid-sixteenth century on   the low countries  and  the netherlands  lost their original deictic meaning  and were xa0\u2013 besides flanders xa0\u2013 probably the most commonly used names  the eighty years  war (1568\u20131648  divided the low countries into an independent northern dutch republic  or latinised belgica foederata   federated netherlands   the precursor state of the netherlands  and a spanish controlled southern netherlands  latinised belgica regia   royal netherlands   the precursor state of belgium   the low countries today is a designation that includes the countries the netherlands  belgium and luxembourg  although in most romance languages  the term  low countries  is used as the name for the netherlands specifically  it is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term benelux   the prehistory of the area that is now the netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the low-lying geography  the oldest human  neanderthal  traces in the netherlands were found in higher soils  near maastricht  from what is believed to be about 250,000 years ago  after the end of the ice age  various paleolithic groups inhabited the area  and around 8000 bc mesolithic tribes resided in friesland and drenthe  where the oldest canoe in the world was recovered  29  autochthonous hunter-gatherers from the swifterbant culture are attested from around 5600 bc onwards  30  they are strongly linked to rivers and open water and were related to the southern scandinavian erteb xf8lle culture (5300\u20134000 bc   to the west  the same tribes might have built hunting camps to hunt winter game  people made the switch to animal husbandry sometime between 4800 bc and 4500 bc  agricultural transformation took place very gradually  between 4300 bc and 4000 bc  31  the farming funnelbeaker culture extended from denmark through northern germany into the northern netherlands  and erected the dolmens  large stone grave monuments found in drenthe  built between 4100 bc and 3200 bc   to the southwest  the vlaardingen culture  around 2600 bc   an apparently more primitive culture of hunter-gatherers survived well into the neolithic period  around 2950 bc there was a quick and smooth transition from the funnelbeaker farming culture to the pan-european corded ware pastoralist culture  32  the bell beaker culture  also present in the netherlands  apparently rose out of the corded ware culture  33][34   discoveries of copper artifacts imply trade with other parts of europe  as the metal is not normally found in dutch soil  the bronze age probably started somewhere around 2000 bc and lasted until around 800 bc  the many finds in drenthe of rare and valuable objects  suggest that it was a trading centre in the bronze age  the bell beaker cultures (2700\u20132100 bc  locally developed into the bronze age barbed-wire beaker culture (2100\u20131800 bc   in the second millennium bc  the region was the boundary between the atlantic and nordic horizons  roughly divided by the course of the rhine  in the north  the elp culture  c  1800 bc to 800 bc  35  was a bronze age archaeological culture having earthenware pottery of low quality as a marker  the initial phase was characterised by tumuli (1800\u20131200 bc  that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern germany and scandinavia  and were apparently related to the tumulus culture (1600\u20131200 bc  in central europe  this phase was followed by a subsequent change featuring urnfield  cremation  burial customs (1200\u2013800 bc   the southern region became dominated by the hilversum culture (1800\u2013800 bc   which apparently inherited cultural ties with britain of the previous barbed-wire beaker culture   the iron age brought a measure of prosperity  iron ore was available throughout the country  including bog iron extracted from the ore in peat bogs in the north  the natural iron-bearing balls found in the veluwe and the red iron ore near the rivers in brabant  smiths travelled from small settlement to settlement with bronze and iron  fabricating tools on demand  including axes  knives  pins  arrowheads and swords  some evidence even suggests the making of damascus steel swords using an advanced method of forging that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel  the king s grave of oss dating from around 500 bc was found in a burial mound  the largest of its kind in western europe and containing an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral   the deteriorating climate in scandinavia around 850 bc  that further deteriorated around 650 bc  might have triggered migration of germanic tribes from the north  by the time this migration was complete  around 250 bc  a few general cultural and linguistic groups had emerged  36][37  the north sea germanic ingvaeones inhabited the northern part of the low countries  they would later develop into the frisii and the early saxons  37  a second grouping  the weser-rhine germanic  or istvaeones   extended along the middle rhine and weser and inhabited the low countries south of the great rivers  this group consisted of tribes that would eventually develop into the salian franks  37  also the celtic la t xe8ne culture  c  450 bc up to the roman conquest  had expanded over a wide range  including the southern area of the low countries  some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language  neither germanic nor celtic  survived in the netherlands until the roman period  the iron age nordwestblock culture  38][39  that eventually was being absorbed by the celts to the south and the germanic peoples from the east   during the gallic wars  the area south of the oude rijn and west of the rhine was conquered by roman forces under julius caesar from 57 bc to 53 bc  39  caesar describes two main tribes living in what is now the southern netherlands  the menapii and the eburones  the rhine became fixed as rome s northern frontier around 12 ad  notable towns would arise along the limes germanicus  nijmegen and voorburg  at first part of gallia belgica  the area south of the limes became part of the roman province of germania inferior  the area to the north of the rhine  inhabited by the frisii  remained outside roman rule  but not its presence and control   while the border tribes batavi and cananefates served in the roman cavalry  40  the batavi rose against the romans in the batavian rebellion of 69ad  but were eventually defeated  the batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the salian franks  whose identity emerged at the first half of the third century  41  salian franks appear in roman texts as both allies and enemies  the salian franks were forced by the confederation of the saxons from the east to move over the rhine into roman territory in the fourth century  from their new base in west flanders and the southwest netherlands  they were raiding the english channel  roman forces pacified the region  but did not expel the franks  who continued to be feared at least until the time of julian the apostate (358   when salian franks were allowed to settle as foederati in toxandria  41  after deteriorating climate conditions and the romans withdrawal  the frisii disappeared from the northern netherlands  probably forced to resettle within roman territory as laeti in c  296  coastal lands remained largely unpopulated for the next two centuries  42   after roman government in the area collapsed  the franks expanded their territories in numerous kingdoms  by the 490s  clovis i had conquered and united all these territories in the southern netherlands in one frankish kingdom  and from there continued his conquests into gaul  during this expansion  franks migrating to the south eventually adopted the vulgar latin of the local population  37  a widening cultural divide grew with the franks remaining in their original homeland in the north  i e  southern netherlands and flanders   who kept on speaking old frankish  which by the ninth century had evolved into old low franconian or old dutch  37  a dutch-french language boundary came into existence  37][43   to the north of the franks  climatic conditions on the coast improved  and during the migration period the abandoned land was resettled again  mostly by saxons  but also by the closely related angles  jutes and ancient frisii  44  many moved on to england and came to be known as anglo-saxons  but those who stayed would be referred to as frisians and their language as frisian  named after the land that was once inhabited by frisii  44  frisian was spoken along the entire southern north sea coast  and it is still the language most closely related to english among the living languages of continental europe  by the seventh century a frisian kingdom (650\u2013734  under king aldegisel and king redbad emerged with utrecht as its centre of power  44][45  while dorestad was a flourishing trading place  46][47  between 600 and around 719 the cities were often fought over between the frisians and the franks  in 734  at the battle of the boarn  the frisians were defeated after a series of wars  with the approval of the franks  the anglo-saxon missionary willibrord converted the frisian people to christianity  he established the archdiocese of utrecht and became bishop of the frisians  however  his successor boniface was murdered by the frisians in dokkum  in 754   the frankish carolingian empire modeled itself after the roman empire and controlled much of western europe  however  as of 843  it was divided into three parts u2014east  middle  and west francia  most of present-day netherlands became part of middle francia  which was a weak kingdom and subject of numerous partitions and annexation attempts by its stronger neighbours  it comprises territories from frisia in the north to the kingdom of italy in the south  when the middle kingdom was partitioned  the lands north of the alps passed to lothair ii and consecutively were named lotharingia  after he died in 869  lotharingia was partitioned  into upper and lower lotharingia  the latter part comprising the low countries that technically became part of east francia in 870  although it was effectively under the control of vikings  who raided the largely defenceless frisian and frankish towns lying on the frisian coast and along the rivers  around 850  lothair i acknowledged the viking rorik of dorestad as ruler of most of frisia  48  around 879  another viking raided the frisian lands  godfrid  duke of frisia  the viking raids made the sway of french and german lords in the area weak  resistance to the vikings  if any  came from local nobles  who gained in stature as a result  and that lay the basis for the disintegration of lower lotharingia into semi-independent states  one of these local nobles was gerolf of holland  who assumed lordship in frisia after he helped to assassinate godfrid  and viking rule came to an end   the holy roman empire  the successor state of east francia  ruled much of the low countries in the 10th and 11th century  but was not able to maintain political unity  powerful local nobles turned their cities  counties and duchies into private kingdoms  that felt little sense of obligation to the emperor  holland  hainaut  flanders  gelre  brabant  and the utrecht were in a state of almost continual war or paradoxically formed personal unions  the language and culture of most of the people who lived in the county of holland were originally frisian  as frankish settlement progressed from flanders and brabant  the area quickly became old low franconian  or old dutch   the rest of frisia in the north  now friesland and groningen  continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions  collectively called the  frisian freedom   and resented the imposition of the feudal system   around 1000 ad  due to several agricultural developments  the economy started to develop at a fast pace  and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen  towns grew around monasteries and castles  and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas  especially in flanders and later also brabant  wealthy cities started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign  in practice  this meant that brugge and antwerp became quasi-independent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in europe   around 1100 ad  farmers from flanders and utrecht began draining and cultivating uninhabited swampy land in the western netherlands  and made the emergence of the county of holland as center of power possible  the title of count of holland were fought over in the hook and cod wars  dutch  hoekse en kabeljauwse twisten  between 1350 and 1490  the cod faction consisted of the more progressive cities  while the hook faction consisted of the conservative noblemen  these noblemen invited the duke philip the good of burgundy \u2013 who was also count of flanders \u2013 to conquer holland   most of the imperial and french fiefs in what is now the netherlands and belgium were united in a personal union by philip the good  duke of burgundy in 1433  the house of valois-burgundy and their habsburg heirs would rule the low countries in the period from 1384 to 1581  before the burgundian union  the dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in or their local duchy or county  the burgundian period is when the road to nationhood began  the new rulers defended dutch trading interests  which then developed rapidly  the fleets of the county of holland defeated the fleets of the hanseatic league several times  amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in europe for grain from the baltic region  amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of belgium  northern france and england  this trade was vital  because holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself  land drainage had caused the peat of the former wetlands to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained   under habsburg charles v  ruler of the holy roman empire and king of spain  all fiefs in the current netherlands region were united into the seventeen provinces  which also included most of present-day belgium  luxembourg  and some adjacent land in what is now france and germany  in 1568  the eighty years  war between the provinces and their spanish ruler began  in 1579  the northern half of the seventeen provinces forged the union of utrecht in which they committed to support each other in their defence against the spanish army  49  the union of utrecht is seen as the foundation of the modern netherlands  in 1581  the northern provinces adopted the act of abjuration  the declaration of independence in which the provinces officially deposed philip ii of spain as reigning monarch in the northern provinces  50   the protestant queen elizabeth i of england sympathised with the dutch struggle against the spanish  and sent an army of 7,600 soldiers to aid the dutch in their war with the catholic spanish  51  the english army under command of robert dudley  1st earl of leicester was of no real benefit to the dutch rebellion  52  philip ii  the son of charles v  was not prepared to let them go easily  and war continued until 1648  when spain under king philip iv finally recognised the independence of the seven north-western provinces in the peace of m xfcnster  parts of the southern provinces became de facto colonies of the new republican-mercantile empire   after declaring their independence  the provinces of holland  zeeland  groningen  friesland  utrecht  overijssel  and gelderland formed a confederation  all these duchies  lordships and counties were autonomous and had their own government  the states-provincial  the states general  the confederal government  were seated in the hague and consisted of representatives from each of the seven provinces  the sparsely populated region of drenthe was part of the republic too  although it was not considered one of the provinces  moreover  the republic had come to occupy during the eighty years  war a number of so-called generality lands in flanders  brabant and limburg  their population was mainly roman catholic  and these areas did not have a governmental structure of their own  and were used as a buffer zone between the republic and the spanish-controlled southern netherlands  citation needed   in the dutch golden age  spanning much of the 17th century  the dutch empire grew to become one of the major seafaring and economic powers  science  military  and art  especially painting  were among the most acclaimed in the world  by 1650  the dutch owned 16,000 merchant ships  53  the dutch east india company and the dutch west india company established colonies and trading posts all over the world  including ruling the northern parts of taiwan between 1624\u20131662 and 1664\u20131667  the dutch settlement in north america began with the founding of new amsterdam on the southern part of manhattan in 1614  in south africa  the dutch settled the cape colony in 1652  dutch colonies in south america were established along the many rivers in the fertile guyana plains  among them colony of surinam  now suriname   in asia  the dutch established the dutch east indies  now indonesia   and the only western trading post in japan  dejima   many economic historians regard the netherlands as the first thoroughly capitalist country in the world  in early modern europe it had the wealthiest trading city  amsterdam  and the first full-time stock exchange  the inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the boom-bust cycle  the world s first asset-inflation bubble  the tulip mania of 1636\u20131637  and the world s first bear raider  isaac le maire  who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount  54  in 1672 \u2013 known in dutch history as the rampjaar  disaster year  \u2013 the dutch republic was in war with france  england and three german bishoprics simultaneously  at sea it could successfully prevent the english and french navy entering the western shores  on land  however  it was almost taken over interlay by the advancing french and german armies coming from the east  it could however turn the tide by inundating parts of holland  but could never recover to its former glory again and went into a state of general decline in the 18th century  with economic competition from england and long-standing rivalries between the two main factions in dutch society  the republican staatsgezinden and the supporters of the stadtholder the prinsgezinden  as main political factions  55   with the armed support of revolutionary france  dutch republicans proclaimed the batavian republic  modelled after the french republic and rendering the netherlands a unitary state on 19 january 1795  the stadtholder william v of orange had fled to england  but from 1806 to 1810  the kingdom of holland was set up by napoleon bonaparte as a puppet kingdom governed by his brother louis bonaparte to control the netherlands more effectively  however  king louis bonaparte tried to serve dutch interests instead of his brother s  and he was forced to abdicate on 1 july 1810  the emperor sent in an army and the netherlands became part of the french empire until the autumn of 1813  when napoleon was defeated in the battle of leipzig   william frederick  son of the last stadtholder  returned to the netherlands in 1813 and proclaimed himself sovereign prince of the netherlands  two years later  the congress of vienna added the southern netherlands to the north to create a strong country on the northern border of france  william frederick raised this united netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself king william i  in addition  william became hereditary grand duke of luxembourg in exchange for his german possessions  however  the southern netherlands had been culturally separate from the north since 1581  and rebelled  the south gained independence in 1830 as belgium  while the personal union between luxembourg and the netherlands was severed in 1890  when william iii died with no surviving male heirs  ascendancy laws prevented his daughter queen wilhelmina from becoming the next grand duchess   the belgian revolution at home and the java war in the dutch east indies brought the netherlands to the brink of bankruptcy  however  the cultivation system was introduced in 1830  in the dutch east indies  20  of village land had to be devoted to government crops for export  the policy brought the dutch enormous wealth and made the colony self-sufficient  on the other hand  the colonies in the west indies  dutch guiana and cura xe7ao and dependencies   relied heavily on african slaves in which the dutch part is estimated at 5\u20137 percent  or more than half a million africans  the netherlands abolished slavery in 1863.[56  furthermore  slaves in suriname would be fully free only in 1873  since the law stipulated that there was to be a mandatory 10-year transition  57  the dutch were also one of the last european countries to industrialise  in the second half of the 19th century   the netherlands were able to remain neutral during world war i  in part because the import of goods through the netherlands proved essential to german survival  until the blockade by the british royal navy in 1916.[58  that changed in world war ii  when nazi germany invaded the netherlands on 10 may 1940  the rotterdam blitz forced the main element of the dutch army to surrender four days later  during the occupation  over 100,000 dutch jews 59  were rounded up and transported to nazi extermination camps of whom only a few survived  dutch workers were conscripted for forced labour in germany  civilians who resisted were killed in reprisal for attacks on german soldiers  and the countryside was plundered for food  although there were thousands of dutch who risked their lives by hiding jews from the germans  over 20,000 dutch fascists joined the waffen ss  60  fighting on the eastern front  61  political collaborators were members of the fascist nsb  the only legal political party in the occupied netherlands  on 8 december 1941  the dutch government-in-exile in london declared war on japan  62  but could not prevent the japanese occupation of the dutch east indies (indonesia   63  in 1944\u201345  the first canadian army  which included canadian  british and polish troops  was responsible for liberating much of the netherlands  64  but soon after ve day  the dutch fought a colonial war against the new republic of indonesia   in 1954  the charter for the kingdom of the netherlands reformed the political structure of the netherlands  which was a result of international pressure to carry out decolonisation  the dutch colonies of surinam and cura xe7ao and dependencies and the european country all became countries within the kingdom  on a basis of equality  indonesia had declared its independence in august 1945  recognised in 1949   and thus was never part of the reformed kingdom  suriname followed in 1975  after the war the netherlands left behind also an era of neutrality and gained closer ties with neighboring states  the netherlands was one of the founding members of the benelux  the nato  euratom and the european coal and steel community  which would evolve into the eec  common market  and later the european union   government-encouraged emigration efforts to reduce population density prompted some 500,000 dutch people to leave the country after the war  65  the 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change  such as rapid ontzuiling  literally  depillarisation   a term that describes the decay of the old divisions along political and religious lines  youths  and students in particular  rejected traditional mores and pushed for change in matters such as women s rights  sexuality  disarmament and environmental issues  on 10 october 2010  the netherlands antilles was dissolved  referendums were held on each island to determine their future status  as a result  the islands of bonaire  sint eustatius and saba  the bes islands  were to obtain closer ties with the netherlands  this led to the incorporation of these three islands into the country of the netherlands as special municipalities upon the dissolution of the netherlands antilles  the special municipalities are collectively known as the caribbean netherlands   the european area of the netherlands lies between latitudes 50\xb0 and 54\xb0 n  and longitudes 3\xb0 and 8\xb0 e   the netherlands is geographically a very low and flat country  with about 26  of its area 66  and 21  of its population 67  located below sea level  and only about 50  of its land exceeding one metre above sea level  13  the country is for the most part flat  with the exception of foothills in the far southeast  up to a height of no more than 321 metres  and some low hill ranges in the central parts  most of the areas below sea level are man-made  caused by peat extraction or achieved through land reclamation  since the late 16th century  large polder areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include dikes  canals and pumping stations  nearly 17  of the country s land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes   much of the country was originally formed by the estuaries of three large european rivers  the rhine  rijn   the meuse  maas  and the scheldt  schelde   as well as their tributaries  the south-western part of the netherlands is to this day a river delta of these three rivers  the rhine-meuse-scheldt delta   the netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the rhine  the waal  its main tributary branch  and the meuse  in the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between fiefdoms and hence historically created a cultural divide  as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the dutch call their  great rivers   de grote rivieren   another significant branch of the rhine  the ijssel river  discharges into lake ijssel  the former zuiderzee   southern sea    just like the previous  this river forms a linguistic divide  people to the northeast of this river speak dutch low saxon dialects  except for the province of friesland  which has its own language   68   over the centuries  the dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention  most notable in terms of land loss was the storm of 1134  which created the archipelago of zeeland in the south-west   on 14 december 1287  st  lucia s flood affected the netherlands and germany killing more than 50,000 people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history  69  the st  elizabeth flood of 1421 and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed polder  replacing it with the 72-square-kilometre (28\xa0sq xa0mi  biesbosch tidal floodplains in the south-centre  the huge north sea flood of early february 1953 caused the collapse of several dikes in the south-west of the netherlands  more than 1,800 people drowned in the flood  the dutch government subsequently instituted a large-scale programme  the  delta works   to protect the country against future flooding  which was completed over a period of more than thirty years   the impact of disasters was to an extent increased through human activity  relatively high-lying swampland was drained to be used as farmland  the drainage caused the fertile peat to contract and ground levels to drop  upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level  causing the underlying peat to contract further  additionally  until the 19th century peat was mined  dried  and used for fuel  further exacerbating the problem  centuries of extensive and poorly controlled peat extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres  even in flooded areas  peat extraction continued through turf dredging   because of the flooding  farming was difficult  which encouraged foreign trade  the result of which was that the dutch were involved in world affairs since the early 14th 15th century  70   to guard against floods  a series of defences against the water were contrived  in the first millennium ad  villages and farmhouses were built on man-made hills called terps  later  these terps were connected by dikes  in the 12th century  local government agencies called  waterschappen    water boards   or  hoogheemraadschappen    high home councils   started to appear  whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods  these agencies continue to exist  as the ground level dropped  the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system  by the 13th century windmills had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level  the windmills were later used to drain lakes  creating the famous polders  citation needed   in 1932 the afsluitdijk   closure dike   was completed  blocking the former zuiderzee  southern sea  from the north sea and thus creating the ijsselmeer  ijssel lake   it became part of the larger zuiderzee works in which four polders totalling 2,500 square kilometres (965\xa0sq xa0mi  were reclaimed from the sea  71][72   the netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from climate change  not only is the rising sea a problem  but erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow  73][74][75   after the 1953 disaster  the delta works were constructed  a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the dutch coast  the project started in 1958 and was largely completed in 1997 with the completion of the maeslantkering  new projects have been periodically started since to renovate and renew the delta works  a main goal of the delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in south holland and zeeland to once per 10,000 years  compared to 1 per 4000 years for the rest of the country   this was achieved by raising 3,000 kilometres (1,864\xa0mi  of outer sea-dykes and 10,000 kilometres (6,214\xa0mi  of inner  canal  and river dikes  and by closing off the sea estuaries of the zeeland province  new risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional delta project dyke reinforcements  the delta project is considered by the american society of civil engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world  76   it is anticipated that global warming in the 21st century will result in a rise in sea level  the netherlands is actively preparing for a sea level rise  see flood control in the netherlands   a politically neutral delta commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea level rise of 1.10 metres (3.6\xa0ft  and a simultaneous land height decline of 10 centimetres (3.9\xa0in   the plan encompasses the reinforcement of the existing coastal defenses like dikes and dunes with 1.30 metres (4.3\xa0ft  of additional flood protection  climate change will not only threaten the netherlands from the sea side  but could also alter rain fall patterns and river run-off  to protect the country from river flooding  another program is already being executed  the room for the river plan grants more flow space to rivers  protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands  the few residents who lived in these so-called  overflow areas  have been moved to higher ground  with some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels  77   the predominant wind direction in the netherlands is southwest  which causes a moderate maritime climate  with warm summers and cool winters  and typically high humidity  this is especially true close to the dutch coastline  where the difference in temperature between summer and winter  as well as between day and night is noticeably smaller than it is in the southeast of the country   the following tables are based on mean measurements by the knmi weather station in de bilt between 1981 and 2010   ice days  maximum temperature below 0\xa0\xb0c (32\xa0\xb0f   usually occur from december until february  with the occasional rare ice day prior to or after that period  freezing days  minimum temperature below 0\xa0\xb0c (32\xa0\xb0f   occur much more often  usually ranging from mid-november to late march  but not rarely measured as early as mid-october and as late as mid-may  if one chooses the height of measurement to be 10\xa0cm (4\xa0in  above ground instead of 150\xa0cm (59\xa0in   one may even find such temperatures in the middle of the summer  on average

august   precipitation throughout the year is distributed relatively equally each month  summer and autumn months tend to gather a little more precipitation than the other months  mainly because of the intensity of the rainfall rather than the frequency of rain days  this is especially the case in summer  when lightning is also much more frequent    the number of sunshine hours is affected by the fact that because of the geographical latitude  the length of the days varies between barely eight hours in december and nearly 17 hours in june   the netherlands has 20 national parks and hundreds of other nature reserves  that include lakes  heathland  woods  dunes and other habitats  most of these are owned by staatsbosbeheer  the national department for forestry and nature conservation and natuurmonumenten  literally  natures monuments    a private organisation that buys  protects and manages nature reserves  the dutch part of the wadden sea in the north  with its tidal flats and wetlands  is rich in biological diversity  and was declared a unesco world heritage nature site in 2009   the oosterschelde  formerly the northeast estuary of the river scheldt was designated a national park in 2002  thereby making it the largest national park in the netherlands at an area of 370 square kilometres (140\xa0sq xa0mi   it consists primarily of the salt waters of the oosterschelde  but also includes mud flats  meadows  and shoals  because of the large variety of sea life  including unique regional species  the park is popular with scuba divers  other activities include sailing  fishing  cycling  and bird watching   phytogeographically  the netherlands is shared between the atlantic european and central european provinces of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom  according to the world wide fund for nature  the territory of the netherlands belongs to the ecoregion of atlantic mixed forests  in 1871  the last old original natural woods were cut down  and most woods today are planted monocultures of trees like scots pine and trees that are not native to the netherlands  citation needed  these woods were planted on anthropogenic

summer  the windward islands can be subject to hurricanes   the netherlands has been a constitutional monarchy since 1815 and a parliamentary democracy since 1848  the netherlands is described as a consociational state  dutch politics and governance are characterised by an effort to achieve broad consensus on important issues  within both the political community and society as a whole  in 2010  the economist ranked the netherlands as the 10th most democratic country in the world  the monarch is the head of state  at present king willem-alexander  constitutionally  the position is equipped with limited powers  by law  the king  the title queen has no constitutional significance  has the right to be periodically briefed and consulted on government affairs  depending on the personalities and relationships of the king and the ministers  the king might have influence beyond the power granted by the constitution   the executive power is formed by the council of ministers  the deliberative council of the dutch cabinet  the cabinet usually consists of 13 to 16 ministers and a varying number of state secretaries  one to three ministers are ministers without portfolio  the head of government is the prime minister of the netherlands  who often is the leader of the largest party of the coalition  the prime minister is a primus inter pares  with no explicit powers beyond those of the other ministers  mark rutte has been prime minister since october 2010  the prime minister had been the leader of the largest party continuously since 1973   the cabinet is responsible to the bicameral parliament  the states general  which also has legislative powers  the 150 members of the house of representatives  the lower house  are elected in direct elections on the basis of party-list proportional representation  these are held every four years  or sooner in case the cabinet falls  for example  when one of the chambers carries a motion of no confidence  the cabinet offers its resignation to the monarch   the states-provincial are directly elected every four years as well  the members of the provincial assemblies elect the 75 members of the senate  the upper house  which has the power to reject laws  but not propose or amend them   both trade unions and employers organisations are consulted beforehand in policymaking in the financial  economic and social areas  they meet regularly with government in the social-economic council  this body advises government and its advice cannot be put aside easily   the netherlands has a long tradition of social tolerance  in the 18th century  while the dutch reformed church was the state religion  catholicism  other forms of protestantism  such as baptists and lutherans  and judaism were tolerated but discriminated against   in the late 19th century this dutch tradition of religious tolerance transformed into a system of pillarisation  in which religious groups coexisted separately and only interacted at the level of government  this tradition of tolerance influences dutch criminal justice policies on recreational drugs  prostitution  lgbt rights  euthanasia  and abortion  which are among the most liberal in the world   because of the multi-party system  no single party has held a majority in parliament since the 19th century  and coalition cabinets had to be formed  since suffrage became universal in 1919  the dutch political system has been dominated by three families of political parties  the strongest of which were the christian democrats  currently represented by the christian democratic appeal  cda   second were the social democrats  represented by the labour party  pvda   and third were the liberals  of which the right wing people s party for freedom and democracy  vvd  is the main representative   these parties co-operated in coalition cabinets in which the christian democrats had always been a partner  so either a centre-left coalition of the christian democrats and social democrats was ruling or a centre-right coalition of christian democrats and liberals  in the 1970s  the party system became more volatile  the christian democratic parties lost seats  while new parties became successful  such as the radical democrat and progressive liberal d66   in the 1994 election  the cda lost its dominant position  a  purple  cabinet was formed by vvd  d66  and pvda  in the 2002 elections  this cabinet lost its majority  because of an increased support for the cda and the rise of the right lpf  a new political party  around pim fortuyn  who was assassinated a week before the elections  a short-lived cabinet was formed by cda  vvd  and lpf  which was led by the cda leader jan peter balkenende  after the 2003 elections  in which the lpf lost most of its seats  a cabinet was formed by cda  vvd  and d66  the cabinet initiated an ambitious programme of reforming the welfare state  the healthcare system  and immigration policy   in june 2006  the cabinet fell after d66 voted in favour of a motion of no confidence against the minister of immigration and integration  rita verdonk  who had instigated an investigation of the asylum procedure of ayaan hirsi ali  a vvd mp  a caretaker cabinet was formed by cda and vvd  and general elections were held on 22 november 2006  in these elections  the cda remained the largest party and the socialist party made the largest gains  the formation of a new cabinet took three months  resulting in a coalition of cda  pvda  and christianunion   on 20 february 2010  the cabinet fell when the pvda refused to prolong the involvement of the dutch army in uruzgan  afghanistan  80  snap elections were held on 9 june 2010  with devastating results for the previously largest party  the cda  which lost about half of its seats  resulting in 21 seats  the vvd became the largest party with 31 seats  closely followed by the pvda with 30 seats  the big winner of the 2010 elections was geert wilders  whose right wing pvv  81][82  the ideological successor to the lpf  more than doubled its number of seats  83  negotiation talks for a new government resulted in a minority government  led by vvd  a first  in coalition with cda  which was sworn in on 14 october 2010  this unprecedented minority government was supported by pvv  but proved ultimately to be unstable  84  when on 21 april 2012  wilders  leader of pvv  unexpectedly  torpedoed seven weeks of austerity talks  on new austerity measures  paving the way for early elections  85][86][87   vvd and pvda were the big winners of the elections  since 5 november 2012 they have formed the second rutte cabinet   the netherlands is divided into twelve provinces  each under a commissioner of the king  commissaris van de koning   except for limburg province where the position is named governor  gouverneur   all provinces are divided into municipalities  gemeenten   of which there are 388 (2017).[88   the country is also subdivided into 24 water districts  governed by a water board  waterschap or hoogheemraadschap   each having authority in matters concerning water management  89  the creation of water boards actually pre-dates that of the nation itself  the first appearing in 1196  the dutch water boards are among the oldest democratic entities in the world still in existence  direct elections of the water boards take place every 4 years   the administrative structure on the 3 bes islands  collectively known as the caribbean netherlands  is different  these islands have the status of openbare lichamen  public bodies  rather than municipalities and as administrative units are generally referred to as special municipalities  they are not part of a province  90   the netherlands has several belgian exclaves [91  and within those even several enclaves which are still part of the province of north brabant  because the netherlands and belgium are both in the schengen area  citizens of respective countries can easily travel through these enclaves   the history of dutch foreign policy has been characterised by its neutrality  since world war ii  the netherlands has become a member of a large number of international organisations  most prominently the un  nato and the eu  the dutch economy is very open and relies strongly on international trade   the foreign policy of the netherlands is based on four basic commitments  to atlantic co-operation  to european integration  to international development and to international law  one of the more controversial international issues surrounding the netherlands is its liberal policy towards soft drugs   during and after the dutch golden age  the dutch people built up a commercial and colonial empire  the most important colonies were present-day suriname and indonesia  indonesia became independent after the indonesian national revolution in the 1940s following a war of independence  international pressure and several un security council resolutions  suriname became independent in 1975  the historical ties inherited from its colonial past still influence the foreign relations of the netherlands  in addition  many people from these countries are living permanently in the netherlands   the netherlands has one of the oldest standing armies in europe  it was first established as such by maurice of nassau  the dutch army was used throughout the dutch empire  after the defeat of napoleon  the dutch army was transformed into a conscription army  the army was unsuccessfully deployed during the belgian revolution in 1830  after 1830  it was deployed mainly in the dutch colonies  as the netherlands remained neutral in european wars  including the first world war   until the netherlands was invaded in world war ii and quickly defeated by the wehrmacht in may 1940   the netherlands abandoned its neutrality in 1948 when it signed the treaty of brussels  and became a founding member of nato in 1949  the dutch military was therefore part of the nato strength in cold war europe  deploying its army to several bases in germany  more than 3,000 dutch soldiers were assigned to the 2nd infantry division of the united states army during the korean war  in 1996 conscription was suspended  and the dutch army was once again transformed into a professional army  since the 1990s the dutch army has been involved in the bosnian war and the kosovo war  it held a province in iraq after the defeat of saddam hussein  and it was engaged in afghanistan   the military is composed of four branches  all of

and farming  including the cultivation of the soil for growing crops and raising domesticated animals  dutch cuisine is simple and straightforward  and contains many dairy products  breakfast and lunch are typically bread with toppings  with cereal for breakfast as an alternative  traditionally  dinner consists of potatoes  a portion of meat  and  seasonal  vegetables  the dutch diet was relatively high in carbohydrates and fat  reflecting the dietary needs of the labourers whose culture moulded the country  without many refinements  it is best described as rustic  though many holidays are still celebrated with special foods  in the course of the twentieth century this diet changed and became much more cosmopolitan  with most global cuisines being represented in the major cities   modern culinary writers distinguish between three general regional forms of dutch cuisine  the regions in the northeast of the netherlands  roughly the provinces of groningen  friesland  drenthe  overijssel and gelderland north of the great rivers are the least populated area of the netherlands  the late (18th century  introduction of large scale agriculture means that the cuisine is generally known for its many kinds of meats  the relative lack of farms allowed for an abundance of game and husbandry  though dishes near the coastal regions of friesland  groningen and the parts of overijssel bordering the ijsselmeer also include a large amount of fish  the various dried sausages  belonging to the metworst-family of dutch sausages are found throughout this region and are highly prized for their often very strong taste  also smoked sausages are common  of which  gelderse  rookworst is the most renowned  the sausage contains a lot of fat and is very juicy  larger sausages are often eaten alongside stamppot  hutspot or zuurkool  sauerkraut   whereas smaller ones are often eaten as a street food  the provinces are also home to hard textured rye bread  pastries and cookies  the latter heavily spiced with ginger or succade or contain small bits of meat  various kinds of kruidkoek  such as groninger koek   fryske d xfamkes and spekdikken  small savory pancakes cooked in a waffle iron  are considered typical  notable characteristics of fries roggebrood  frisian rye bread  is its long baking time  up to 20 hours   resulting in a sweet taste and a deep dark colour  204  in terms of alcoholic beverages  the region is renowned for its many bitters  such as beerenburg  and other high-proof liquors rather than beer  which is  apart from jenever  typical for the rest of the country  as a coastal region  friesland is home to low-lying grasslands  and thus has a cheese production in common with the western cuisine  friese nagelkaas  friesian clove  is a notable example   the provinces of north holland  south holland  zeeland  utrecht and the gelderlandic region of betuwe are the parts of the netherlands which make up the region in which western dutch cuisine is found  because of the abundance of water and flat grass lands that are found here  the area is known for its many dairy products  which includes prominent cheeses such as gouda  leyden  spiced cheese with cumin   edam  traditionally in small spheres  as well as leerdammer and beemster  while the adjacent zaanstreek in north holland is since the 16th century known for its mayonnaise  typical whole-grain mustards 205  and chocolate industry  zeeland and south holland produce a lot of butter  which contains a larger amount of milkfat than most other european butter varieties  a by-product of the butter-making process  karnemelk  buttermilk   is also considered typical for this region  seafood such as soused herring  mussels  called zeeuwse mossels  since all dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in zeeland s oosterschelde   eels  oysters and shrimps are widely available and typical for the region  kibbeling  once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered white fish  has become a national fast food  just as lekkerbek  pastries in this area tend to be quite doughy  and often contain large amounts of sugar  either caramelised  powdered or crystallised  the oliebol  in its modern form  and zeeuwse bolus are good examples  cookies are also produced in great number and tend to contain a lot of butter and sugar  like stroopwafel  as well as a filling of some kind  mostly almond  like gevulde koek  the traditional alcoholic beverages of this region are beer  strong pale lager  and jenever  a high proof juniper-flavored spirit  that came to be known in england as gin  a noted exception within the traditional dutch alcoholic landscape  advocaat  a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs  sugar and brandy  is also native to this region   the southern dutch cuisine consists of the cuisines of the dutch provinces of north brabant and limburg and the flemish region in belgium  it is renowned for its many rich pastries  soups  stews and vegetable dishes and is often called burgundian which is a dutch idiom invoking the rich burgundian court which ruled the low countries in the middle ages  renowned for its splendor and great feasts  it is the only dutch culinary region that developed an haute cuisine  pastries are abundant  often with rich fillings of cream  custard or fruits  cakes  such as the vlaai from limburg and the moorkop and bossche bol from brabant  are typical pastries  savoury pastries also occur  with the worstenbroodje  a roll with a sausage of ground beef  literally translates into sausage bread  being the most popular  the traditional alcoholic beverage of the region is beer  there are many local brands  ranging from trappist to kriek  5 of the 10 international trappist association recognised breweries in
