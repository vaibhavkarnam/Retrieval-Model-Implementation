Resourcedepletion
 resource depletion is the consumption of a resource faster than it can be replenished  natural resources are commonly divided between renewable resources and non-renewable resources  see also mineral resource classification   use of either of these forms of resources beyond their rate of replacement is considered to be resource depletion   resource depletion is most commonly used in reference to farming  fishing  mining  water usage  and consumption of fossil fuels  1       minerals are needed to provide food  clothing  and housing  a united states geological survey  usgs  study found a significant long-term trend over the 20th century for non-renewable resources such as minerals to supply a greater proportion of the raw material inputs to the non-fuel  non-food sector of the economy  an example is the greater consumption of crushed stone  sand  and gravel used in construction  2   large-scale exploitation of minerals began in the industrial revolution around 1760 in england and has grown rapidly ever since  technological improvements have allowed humans to dig deeper and access lower grades and different types of ore over that time  3][4][5  virtually all basic industrial metals  copper  iron  bauxite  etc    as well as rare earth minerals  face production output limitations from time to time  6  because supply involves large up-front investments and is therefore slow to respond to rapid increases in demand  4   minerals projected by some to enter production decline during the next 20 years   minerals projected by some to enter production decline during the present century   such projections may change  as new discoveries are made 8  and typically misinterpret available data on mineral resources and mineral reserves  4][5   peak oil is the period when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached  after which the rate of production enters terminal decline  it relates to a long-term decline in the available supply of petroleum  this  combined with increasing demand  will significantly increase the worldwide prices of petroleum derived products  most significant will be the availability and price of liquid fuel for transportation   the united states department of energy in the hirsch report indicates that \u201cthe peaking of world oil production presents the u  s  and the world with an unprecedented risk management problem  as peaking is approached  liquid fuel prices and price volatility will increase dramatically  and  without timely mitigation  the economic  social  and political costs will be unprecedented  viable mitigation options exist on both the supply and demand sides  but to have substantial impact  they must be initiated more than a decade in advance of peaking  u201d 12   deforestation is the clearing of forests by logging or burning of trees and plants in a forested area  as a result of deforestation  presently about one half of the forests that once covered earth have been destroyed  13  it occurs for many different reasons  and it has several negative implications on the atmosphere and the quality of the land in and surrounding the forest   one of the main causes of deforestation is clearing forests for agricultural reasons  as the population of developing areas  especially near rainforests  increases  the need for land for farming becomes more and more important  14  for most people  a forest has no value when its resources aren u2019t being used  so the incentives to deforest these areas outweigh the incentives to preserve the forests  for this reason  the economic value of the forests is very important for the developing countries  15   because deforestation is so extensive  it has made several significant impacts on the environment  including carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  changing the water cycle  an increase in soil erosion  and a decrease in biodiversity  deforestation is often cited as a cause of global warming  because trees and plants remove carbon dioxide and emit oxygen into the atmosphere  the reduction of forests contribute to about 12  of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions  16  one of the most pressing issues that deforestation creates is soil erosion  the removal of trees causes higher rates of erosion  increasing risks of landslides  which is a direct threat to many people living close to deforested areas  as forests get destroyed  so does the habitat for millions of animals  it is estimated that 80  of the world u2019s known biodiversity lives in the rainforests  and the destruction of these rainforests is accelerating extinction at an alarming rate  17   the united nations and the world bank created programs such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation  redd   which works especially with developing countries to use subsidies or other incentives to encourage citizens to use the forest in a more sustainable way  18  in addition to making sure that emissions from deforestation are kept to a minimum  an effort to educate people on sustainability and helping them to focus on the long-term risks is key to the success of these programs  19  the new york declaration on forests and its associated actions promotes reforestation  which is being encouraged in many countries in an attempt to repair the damage that deforestation has done  20   wetlands are ecosystems that are often saturated by enough surface or groundwater to sustain vegetation that is usually adapted to saturated soil conditions  such as cattails  bulrushes  red maples  wild rice  blackberries  cranberries  and peat moss  because some varieties of wetlands are rich in minerals and nutrients and provide many of the advantages of both land and water environments they contain diverse species and provide a distinct basis for the food chain   traditionally  wetlands were assumed to be useless so it was not a large concern when they were being dug up for settlements  agricultural use etc   it is now believed that the wetland habitats contribute to a environmental health and biodiversity   in the usa  less than half of the wetlands that still existed in the 1600s have vanished  21   wetlands provide environmental services for   some loss of wetlands resulted from natural causes such as erosion  sedimentation  the buildup of soil by the settling of fine particles over a long period of time   subsidence  the sinking of land because of diminishing underground water supplies   and a rise in the sea level  citation needed   nonnatural causes of wetland degradation and loss include  21
