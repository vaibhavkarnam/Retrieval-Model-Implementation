Automaticgenerationcontrol
 in an electric power system  automatic generation control  agc  is a system for adjusting the power output of multiple generators at different power plants  in response to changes in the load  since a power grid requires that generation and load closely balance moment by moment  frequent adjustments to the output of generators are necessary  the balance can be judged by measuring the system frequency  if it is increasing  more power is being generated than used  which causes all the machines in the system to accelerate  if the system frequency is decreasing  more load is on the system than the instantaneous generation can provide  which causes all generators to slow down   before the use of automatic generation control  one generating unit in a system would be designated as the regulating unit and would be manually adjusted to control the balance between generation and load to maintain system frequency at the desired value  the remaining units would be controlled with speed droop to share the load in proportion to their ratings  with automatic systems  many units in a system can participate in regulation  reducing wear on a single unit s controls and improving overall system efficiency  stability  and economy   where the grid has tie interconnections to adjacent control areas  automatic generation control helps maintain the power interchanges over the tie lines at the scheduled levels  with computer-based control systems and multiple inputs  an automatic generation control system can take into account such matters as the most economical units to adjust  the coordination of thermal  hydroelectric  and other generation types  and even constraints related to the stability of the system and capacity of interconnections to other power grids  1   1.1 types  1.1.1 turbine-governor control  tgc  -  turbine generators in a power system have stored kinetic energy due to their large rotating masses  all the kinetic energy stored in a power system in such rotating masses is a part of the grid inertia  when system load increases  grid inertia is initially used to supply the load  this  however  leads to a decrease in the stored kinetic energy of the turbine generators  since the mechanical power of these turbines correlates with the delivered electrical power  the turbine generators have a decrease in angular velocity  which is directly proportional to a decrease in frequency in synchronous generators   the purpose of the turbine-governor control is to maintain the desired system frequency by adjusting the mechanical power output of the turbine  2  these controllers have become automated and at steady state  the frequency-power relation for turbine-governor control is   \n n n n u0394\n np n nm n n n  n u0394\n np n nr ne nf n n n u2212\n1\n n  n nr n xd7\n u0394 nf n n n   displaystyle   delta p  m    delta p  ref -1 r  times   delta f  n n  where   \n n n n u0394 n np n nm n n n n n   displaystyle   delta p  m   n n is the change in turbine mechanical power output  \n n n n u0394 n np n nr ne nf n n n n n   displaystyle   delta p  ref   n n is the change in a reference power setting  \n n n nr n  n u2212\n u0394\nf n n  n n u0394\n np n nm n n n  n u2212 ns nl no np ne n n n   displaystyle r -  delta f   delta p  m  -slope  n n is the regulation constant which quantifies the sensitivity of the generator to a change in frequency  \n n n n u0394 nf n n n   displaystyle   delta f  n n is the change in frequency   for steam turbines  steam turbine governing adjusts the mechanical output of the turbine by increasing or decreasing the amount of steam entering the turbine via a throttle valve   1.1.2 load-frequency control  lfc  -  load-frequency control is employed to allow an area to first meet its own load demands  then to assist in returning the steady-state frequency of the system  \u0394f  to zero  3  load-frequency control operates with a response time of a few seconds to keep system frequency stable   1.1.3 economic dispatch -  the goal of economic dispatch is to minimize total operating costs in an area by determining how the real power output of each generating unit will meet a given load  4  generating units have different costs to produce a unit of electrical energy  and incur different costs for the losses in transmitting energy to the load  an economic dispatch algorithm will run every few minutes to select the combination of generating unit power setpoints that minimizes overall cost  subject to the constraints of transmission limitation or security of the system against failures  5  further constraints may be imposed by the water supply of hydroelectric generation  or by the availability of sun and wind power   [1
