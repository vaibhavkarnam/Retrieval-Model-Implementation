ElectricalenergyefficiencyonUnitedStatesfarms
 electrical energy efficiency on united states farms covers the use of electricity on farms and the methods and incentives for improving the efficiency of that use   u s  farms have almost doubled their average energy efficiency over the past 25 years  1       energy costs represent between 2   at cattle feed lots  and 9   for grain farming  due partly to grain drying  of farm production costs  2   in 2006 there were about 65,000 dairy farms in the united states  although most had fewer than 200 cows  3  one  resource auditor  believes it is possible for dairy farms to reach an energy usage of as low as 200 kwhr per cow per year 4  although an analysis of california dairy farms found that 300 kwhr year was the lowest actually attained  5   one study 6][7  found the following electrical usages on new york dairy farms   another study 8  found highly similar results   hitherto almost entirely unregulated  except for zoning ordinances and the effects of property taxes   environmental concerns are now beginning to impose restrictions on farms   how renewable energy projects may be implemented and also on what rate of return electricity producers can obtain from utilities are key current topics  acts such as wisconsin s clean energy jobs act  only proposed as of april  2010  are controversial among farmers for these reasons  9  canada s green energy act 2009 implemented similar kinds of regulations  10   contrarily  carbon offsets may soon offer farmers additional incentives to increase energy use efficiency  however  at least one proposed cap and trade process would raise farmers  costs by up to $1.19  usd  per acre  11   corporate average fuel economy fuel standards too  such as in the energy independence and security act of 2007  are controversial  as biofuels are now a significant portion of farm income  12   increased efficiency in farm usage of electricity is being driven by greening as well as by economics    the biggest users of electrical power are heat  light and motors      a recent study found that a 3-hp energy efficient compressor used over 42 percent fewer kilowatt-hours  kwhr  than a 3-hp conventional compressor   13   two prime areas for efficiency improvements are implementing the use of heat recovery systems and variable speed drives  14  one organization postulated a three-year plan for farms to use energy better  15   simply including years of either clover or alfalfa into the cycle of grain crops can yield savings without reducing total crop yields  16][17   farms sometimes use accredited  resource auditors  18  to analyze their operations and recommend improved efficiencies  typically at costs exceeding $1,000 per audit  however  typical full repayment of an audit s cost could be around six years  19  also  a certified farm energy audit may be required for participation in state or federal energy efficiency programs  20   an audit of 20 farms in cumbria showed savings could be made in all areas examined  21   an example of a farm energy audit in maine is at the following reference  22  maryland has a statewide program entitled ensave  23   recently a number of  energy calculators  24][25  have become available  addressing one or more aspects of farm energy usage  new calculators are being developed under government and utility grants  such as one in oregon   some improvements are specific to dairy farms  such as using supplemental lighting with energy efficient lamps  which can increase milk production 5 to 16 percent  or relieving heat stress with a combination of sprinklers and fans to increase the cooling effect and improve energy use  26  california compiled a  complete guide  to dairy farm efficiency improvements  5   norswiss farms of rice lake  wisconsin  an 1100 cow dairy farm  expects to save over $70,000 per year  plus income from electricity sales  from its installation of an 848\xa0kw combined heat and power  chp  system operating on anaerobic digesters gas from cow manure  27  the electricity generated is sold to the grid  a similar installation in 2004 on a 270 cow farm in california  one of five in the state at that time  powered a 75\xa0kw generator  28   central vermont public service has a  cow power  program using methane-fueled electricity from vermont farms  29][30   u s  utilities allocated $5.3 billion to energy efficiency programs in 2009.[31   government and utility incentives can be beneficial to those entities as well   it may be less expensive for governments to encourage efficiency and renewable energy options  in order to  delay or negate the need to upgrade and modernize rural grid infrastructure   2   a partial list of incentives is available at the following reference  32  a link to relevant utility pages is at  33  a third partial list is at  34   alliant energy in wisconsin funds the installation of energy-saving projects  receiving payments on the monthly electric bills  35  national grid has a similar program  36
