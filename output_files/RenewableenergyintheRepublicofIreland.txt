 under the renewable energy directive ireland has set a target of producing 16  of all its energy needs from renewable energy sources by 2020  between 2005 and 2014 the percentage of energy from renewable energy sources grew from just 3.1  to 8.6  of total final consumption  by 2020 ireland has a target of producing 42.5  of its electricity needs from renewable electricity   the country has a large and growing installed windpower capacity at 2,486 mw by the end of 2015 producing just under a quarter of all its electricity needs in that year  in contrast in 2015 it had the second lowest installation of solar pv power in the eu after latvia at just 2.1 mw of installed capacity       projected total gross final energy consumption by sector in 2020   according to the irish national renewable energy action plan (nreap   1  as submitted by all member states as part of the eu renewable energy directive  in 2020 the gross final energy consumption in ireland by sector is projected to break down as follows    all figures calculated as per directive 2009/28 ec  in 2020 the transport sector is expected to comprise 42.6  of final energy consumption  the heating and cooling sector  also known as the thermal sector  includes domestic heating and air conditioning and industrial heat processes is expected to account for 36.6  of final energy consumption the electricity sector is projected to account for 20.9  of consumption   total annual energy consumption  after adjustments  is projected to be 14,142 ktoe (14.142 million tonnes of oil equivalent  by 2020  to meet ireland u2019s overall target of16  use of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2020  it was just 3.1  in 2005  targets have been set for each sector  by 2020 renewable energy use is targeted to be 12  in the heating and cooling sector  42.5  in the electricity sector and 10  in the transport sector   wind power has been growing steadily in ireland by around 200 mw per year rising from 1,027 mw in 2008 to 2,486 mw by end 2015  during the year 2015 wind power provided just under a quarter of the country u2019s electricity demand at just over 23  of the total  3   solar pv installed capacity in ireland is amongst the lowest in europe  it was just over 2mw in 2015  in the same year the corresponding figure for the united kingdom was 8,915 mw 5  and for denmark 790 mw  6  in 2015 the country had the lowest capacity per inhabitant of all eu countries  only latvia had a lower absolute capacity  7  predictions for future growth in installed capacity vary widely from 500 mw by 2021 to 3,700 mw by 2030 with government support  8    converted using iea unit converter   solid biomass was used mostly in the heating and cooling sector providing 222 ktoe of energy  it was also used to generate some electricity at 28 ktoe of energy  biogas was used mostly in the production of electricity contributing 18 ktoe   in 2014 biodiesel provided 90 ktoe to the transport sector whilst bioethanol bio-etbe provided 27 ktoe   overall renewable energy sources show a target trajectory of 6.6  share in 2010 rising to 14  by 2020  the electricity sector shows the most ambitious trajectory with a rise from 6.9  of total supply in 2005 to 42.5  by 2020   according the ireland u2019s third progress report by 2014 the country had achieved an 8.6  share of overall energy use from renewable energy sources  this was below the targeted 11  share planned for that year  renewable energy use in the electricity sector was the furthest from its target of just over 8 percentage points below its target for the year  renewable energy use in the electricity sector has been shown to rise quickly in other years and in other countries so ireland may move closer to achieving its 2020 targets in the next few years
