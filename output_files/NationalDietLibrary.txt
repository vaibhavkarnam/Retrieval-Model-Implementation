 the national diet library  ndl  (\u56fd u7acb u56fd u4f1a u56f3\u66f8\u9928  kokuritsu kokkai toshokan   is the only national library in japan  it was established in 1948 for the purpose of assisting members of the national diet of japan (\u56fd u4f1a  kokkai   in researching matters of public policy  the library is similar in purpose and scope to the united states library of congress   the national diet library  ndl  consists of two main facilities in tokyo and kyoto  and several other branch libraries throughout japan       the national diet library is the successor of three separate libraries  the library of the house of peers  the library of the house of representatives  both of which were established at the creation of japan s imperial diet in 1890  and the imperial library  which had been established in 1872 under the jurisdiction of the ministry of education   the diet s power in prewar japan was limited  and its need for information was  correspondingly small   the original diet libraries  never developed either the collections or the services which might have made them vital adjuncts of genuinely responsible legislative activity   until japan s defeat  moreover  the executive had controlled all political documents  depriving the people and the diet of access to vital information  the u s  occupation forces under general douglas macarthur deemed reform of the diet library system to be an important part of the democratization of japan after its defeat in world war ii   in 1946  each house of the diet formed its own national diet library standing committee  hani gor u014d  a marxist historian who had been imprisoned during the war for thought crimes and had been elected to the house of councillors  the successor to the abolished house of peers  after the war  spearheaded the reform efforts  hani envisioned the new body as  both a  citadel of popular sovereignty   and the means of realizing a  peaceful revolution    the occupation officers responsible for overseeing library reforms reported that  although the occupation was a catalyst for change  local initiative pre-existed the occupation  and the successful reforms were due to dedicated japanese like hani   the national diet library opened in june 1948 in the present-day state guest-house  former akasaka detached palace  with an initial collection of 100,000 volumes  the first librarian of
