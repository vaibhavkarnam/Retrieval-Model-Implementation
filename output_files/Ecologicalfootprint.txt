Ecologicalfootprint
 an ecological footprint is a measurement of how much natural resources it takes to support an individual or group of people  it is an ecological accounting system  it contrasts how much biologically productive area people use for their consumption to how much biologically productive area is available  biocapacity    more specifically  the ecological footprint is the biologically productive area needed to provide for everything people use  fruits and vegetables  fish  wood  fibers  absorption of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel use  and space for buildings and roads  biocapacity is the productive area that can regenerate what people demand from nature  footprint and biocapacity can be compared at the individual  regional  national or global scale  both footprint and biocapacity change every year with number of people  per person consumption  efficiency of production  and productivity of ecosystems   at a global scale  footprint assessments show how big humanity s demand is compared to what planet earth can renew  global footprint network calculates the global ecological footprint from un and other data for over 200 nations  they estimate that as of 2012 humanity has been using natural capital 1.6 times as fast as nature can renew it  1   ecological footprint analysis is widely applied around the earth as an indicator of environmental sustainability  2  it can be used to measure and manage the use of resources throughout the economy and explore the sustainability of individual lifestyles  goods and services  organizations  industry sectors  neighborhoods  cities  regions and nations  3  since 2006  a first set of ecological footprint standards exist that detail both communication and calculation procedures  4       in 2016  the global footprint network estimated the global ecological footprint as 1.6 planet earths  that is  they judged that ecological services were being used 1.6 times as quickly as they were being renewed  1   ecological footprints can be calculated at any scale  for an activity  a person  a community  a city  a region  a nation or humanity as a whole  cities  due to population concentration  have large ecological footprints and have become ground zero for footprint reduction  5   global footprints  currently there is no fixed way to measure global footprints  and any attempts to describe the capacity of an ecosystem in a single number is a massive simplification of thousands of key renewable resources  which are not used or replenished at the same rate  however  there has been some convergence of metrics and standards since 2006.[4   city ecological footprints  are being measured  there are two types of measurements in use  the first measures ecosystem displacement which is defined as city area minus remaining green spaces  this is an area measurement that does not include human or other biological activity  the second attempts to quantify surviving ecosystem health  specifically  it attempts to quantify both area and biological health of ecosystems surviving inside city areas such as nature reserves  parks  other green spaces  city footprints are being calculated and scored with city ecological indexes  6   the first academic publication about ecological footprints was by william rees in 1992.[7  the ecological footprint concept and calculation method was developed as the phd dissertation of mathis wackernagel  under rees  supervision at the university of british columbia in vancouver  canada  from 1990\u20131994.[8  originally  wackernagel and rees called the concept  appropriated carrying capacity   9  to make the idea more accessible  rees came up with the term  ecological footprint   inspired by a computer technician who praised his new computer s  small footprint on the desk   10  in early 1996  wackernagel and rees published the book our ecological footprint  reducing human impact on the earth with illustrations by phil testemale  11   footprint values at the end of a survey are categorized for carbon  food  housing  and goods and services as well as the total footprint number of earths needed to sustain the world s population at that level of consumption  this approach can also be applied to an activity such as the manufacturing of a product or driving of a car  this resource accounting is similar to life-cycle analysis wherein the consumption of energy  biomass  food  fiber   building material  water and other resources are converted into a normalized measure of land area called global hectares  gha    per capita ecological footprint  ef   or ecological footprint analysis  efa   is a means of comparing consumption and lifestyles  and checking this against nature s ability to provide for this consumption  the tool can inform policy by examining to what extent a nation uses more  or less  than is available within its territory  or to what extent the nation s lifestyle would be replicable worldwide  the footprint can also be a useful tool to educate people about carrying capacity and overconsumption  with the aim of altering personal behavior  ecological footprints may be used to argue that many current lifestyles are not sustainable  such a global comparison also clearly shows the inequalities of resource use on this planet at the beginning of the twenty-first century   in 2007  the average biologically productive area per person worldwide was approximately 1.8 global hectares  gha  per capita  the u s  footprint per capita was 9.0 gha  and that of switzerland was 5.6 gha  while china s was 1.8 gha  12][13  the wwf claims that the human footprint has exceeded the biocapacity  the available supply of natural resources  of the planet by 20%.[14  wackernagel and rees originally estimated that the available biological capacity for the 6 billion people on earth at that time was about 1.3 hectares per person  which is smaller than the 1.8 global hectares published for 2006  because the initial studies neither used global hectares nor included bioproductive marine areas  11   a number of ngos offer ecological footprint calculators  see footprint calculator  below    the ecological footprint accounting method at the national level is described in the l footprint atlas 2010[15  or in greater detail in the calculation methodology for the national footprint accounts  16  the national accounts review committee has also published a research agenda on how the method will be improved  17   in 2003  jason venetoulis  carl mas  christopher gaudet  dahlia chazan  and john talberth developed footprint 2   which offers a series of theoretical and methodological improvements to the standard footprint approach  the four primary improvements were that they included the entire surface of the earth in biocapacity estimates  allocated space for other  i e   non-human  species  updated the basis of equivalence factors from agricultural land to net primary productivity  npp   and refined the carbon component of the footprint based on the latest global carbon models  18][19   the uk s average ecological footprint is 5.45 global hectares per capita  gha  with variations between regions ranging from 4.80 gha  wales  to 5.56 gha  east england   13   two recent studies citation needed  have examined relatively low-impact small communities  bedzed  a 96-home mixed-income housing development in south london  was designed by bill dunster architects and sustainability consultants bioregional for the peabody trust  despite being populated by relatively  mainstream  home-buyers  bedzed was found to have a footprint of 3.20 gha due to on-site renewable energy production  energy-efficient architecture  and an extensive green lifestyles program that included on-site london s first carsharing club  the report did not measure the added footprint of the 15,000 visitors who have toured bedzed since its completion in 2002  findhorn ecovillage  a rural intentional community in moray  scotland  had a total footprint of 2.56 gha  including both the many guests and visitors who travel to the community to undertake residential courses there and the nearby campus of cluny hill college  however  the residents alone have a footprint of 2.71 gha  a little over half the uk national average and one of the lowest ecological footprints of any community measured so far in the industrialized world  20][21  keveral farm  an organic farming community in cornwall  was found to have a footprint of 2.4 gha  though with substantial differences in footprints among community members  22   early criticism was published by van den bergh and verbruggen in 1999,[23  which was updated in 2014.[24  another criticism was published in 2008.[25  a more complete review commissioned by the directorate-general for the environment  european commission  was published in june 2008.[26   a recent critique of the concept is due to blomqvist et al   2013a  27  with a reply from rees and wackernagel  2013,[28  and a rejoinder by blomqvist et al   2013b  29   an additional strand of critique is due to giampietro and saltelli (2014a   30  with a reply from goldfinger et al   2014,[31  a rejoinder by giampietro and saltelli (2014a   32  and additional comments from van den bergh and grazi (2015).[33   a number of countries have engaged in research collaborations to test the validity of the method  this includes switzerland  germany  united arab emirates  and belgium  34   grazi et al  (2007  have performed a systematic comparison of the ecological footprint method with spatial welfare analysis that includes environmental externalities  agglomeration effects and trade advantages  35  they find that the two methods can lead to very distinct  and even opposite  rankings of different spatial patterns of economic activity  however this should not be surprising  since the two methods address different research questions   calculating the ecological footprint for densely populated areas  such as a city or small country with a comparatively large population \u2014 e g  new york and singapore respectively \u2014 may lead to the perception of these populations as  parasitic   this is because these communities have little intrinsic biocapacity  and instead must rely upon large hinterlands  critics argue that this is a dubious characterization since mechanized rural farmers in developed nations may easily consume more resources than urban inhabitants  due to transportation requirements and the unavailability of economies of scale  furthermore  such moral conclusions seem to be an argument for autarky  some even take this train of thought a step further  claiming that the footprint denies the benefits of trade  therefore  the critics argue that the footprint can only be applied globally  36   the method seems to reward the replacement of original ecosystems with high-productivity agricultural monocultures by assigning a higher biocapacity to such regions  for example  replacing ancient woodlands or tropical forests with monoculture forests or plantations may improve the ecological footprint  similarly  if organic farming yields were lower than those of conventional methods  this could result in the former being  penalized  with a larger ecological footprint  37  of course  this insight  while valid  stems from the idea of using the footprint as one s only metric  if the use of ecological footprints are complemented with other indicators  such as one for biodiversity  the problem could maybe be solved  indeed  wwf s living planet report complements the biennial footprint calculations with the living planet index of biodiversity  38  manfred lenzen and shauna murray have created a modified ecological footprint that takes biodiversity into account for use in australia  39   although the ecological footprint model prior to 2008 treated nuclear power in the same manner as coal power  40  the actual real world effects of the two are radically different  a life cycle analysis centered on the swedish forsmark nuclear power plant estimated carbon dioxide emissions at 3.10 g kwh 41  and 5.05 g kwh in 2002 for the torness nuclear power station  42  this compares to 11 g kwh for hydroelectric power  950 g kwh for installed coal  900 g kwh for oil and 600 g kwh for natural gas generation in the united states in 1999.[43  figures released by mark hertsgaard  however  show that because of the delays in building nuclear plants and the costs involved  investments in energy efficiency and renewable energies have seven times the return on investment of investments in nuclear energy  44   the swedish utility vattenfall did a study of full life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources the utility uses to produce electricity  namely  nuclear  hydro  coal  gas  solar cell  peat and wind  the net result of the study was that nuclear power produced 3.3\xa0grams of carbon dioxide per kw-hr of produced power  this compares to 400 for natural gas and 700 for coal  according to this study   the study also concluded that nuclear power produced the smallest amount of co2 of any of their electricity sources  45   claims exist that the problems of nuclear waste do not come anywhere close to approaching the problems of fossil fuel waste  46][47  a 2004 article from the bbc states   the world health organization  who  says 3 million people are killed worldwide by outdoor air pollution annually from vehicles and industrial emissions  and 1.6 million indoors through using solid fuel   48  in the u s  alone  fossil fuel waste kills 20,000 people each year  49  a coal power plant releases 100 times as much radiation as a nuclear power plant of the same wattage  50  it is estimated that during 1982  us coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the three mile island incident  51  in addition  fossil fuel waste causes global warming  which leads to increased deaths from hurricanes  flooding  and other weather events  the world nuclear association provides a comparison of deaths due to accidents among different forms of energy production  in their comparison  deaths per tw-yr of electricity produced  in uk and usa  from 1970 to 1992 are quoted as 885 for hydropower  342 for coal  85 for natural gas  and 8 for nuclear  52   the western australian government state of the environment report included an ecological footprint measure for the average western australian seven times the average footprint per person on the planet in 2007  a total of about 15 hectares  53   the world-average ecological footprint in 2012 was 1.8 global hectares per person  the average per country ranges from over 10 to under 1 hectares per person  there is also a high variation within countries  based on individual lifestyle and economic situation  54   the ghg footprint differs from the ecological footprint in that the former is expressed in units of ghg warming potential  ggwp  and is generated by products or services  whereas the latter is expressed in units of land area and is generated by whole societies  55         the average world citizen has an eco-footprint of about 2.7 global average hectares while there are only 2.1 global hectare of bioproductive land and water per capita on earth  this means that humanity has already overshot global biocapacity by 30  and now lives unsustainabily by depleting stocks of  natural capital  56   since the 1950s  a new geological epoch called the anthropocene has been proposed to distinguish the period of major human impact  57
