 carnot s theorem  developed in 1824 by nicolas l xe9onard sadi carnot  also called carnot s rule  is a principle that specifies limits on the maximum efficiency any heat engine can obtain  the efficiency of a carnot engine depends solely on the difference between the hot and cold temperature reservoirs   carnot s theorem states   the formula for this maximum efficiency is  where tc is the absolute temperature of the cold reservoir  th is the absolute temperature of the hot reservoir  and the efficiency \n n n n u03b7 n n n   displaystyle   eta   n n is the ratio of the work done by the engine to the heat drawn out of the hot reservoir   based on modern thermodynamics  carnot s theorem is a result of the second law of thermodynamics  historically  however  it was based on contemporary caloric theory and preceded the establishment of the second law  1       the proof of the carnot theorem is a proof by contradiction  or reductio ad absurdum  as illustrated by the figure showing two heat engines operating between two reservoirs of different temperature  the heat engine with more efficiency (\n n n n n u03b7 n nm n n n n n   displaystyle   eta   m   n n  is driving a heat engine with less efficiency (\n n n n n u03b7 n nl n n n n n   displaystyle   eta   l   n n   causing the latter to act as a heat pump  this pair of engines receives no outside energy  and operates solely on the energy released when heat is transferred from the hot and into the cold reservoir  however  if \n n n n n u03b7\n nm n n n gt  n n u03b7 n nl n n n n n   displaystyle   eta   m  gt   eta   l   n n  then the net heat flow would be backwards  i e   into the hot reservoir   it is generally agreed that this is impossible because it violates the second law of thermodynamics   we begin by verifying the values of work and heat flow depicted in the figure  first  we must point out an important caveat  the engine with less efficiency (\n n n n n u03b7 n nl n n n n n   displaystyle   eta   l   n n  is being driven as a heat pump  and therefore must be a reversible engine  if the less efficient engine (\n n n n n u03b7 n nl n n n n n   displaystyle   eta   l   n n  is not reversible  then the device could be built  but the expressions for work and heat flow shown in the figure would not be valid   by restricting our discussion to cases where engine (\n n n n n u03b7 n nl n n n n n   displaystyle   eta   l   n n  has less efficiency than engine (\n n n n n u03b7 n nm n n n n n   displaystyle   eta   m   n n   we are able to simplify notation by adopting the convention that all symbols   n n n nq n n n   displaystyle q  n n and  n n n nw n n n   displaystyle w  n n represent non-negative quantities  since the direction of energy flow never changes sign in all cases where \n n n n n u03b7\n nl n n n u2a7d n n u03b7 n nm n n n n n   displaystyle   eta   l   leqslant   eta   m   n n   conservation of energy demands that for each engine  the energy which enters   n n n n ne n ni nn n n n n n   displaystyle e  in   n n  must equal the energy which exits   n n n n ne n no nu nt n n n n n   displaystyle e  out   n n   the figure is also consistent with the definition of efficiency as \n n n n u03b7 n  nw n n  n n nq n nh n n n n n   displaystyle   eta  w q  h   n n for both engines   it may seem odd that a hypothetical heat pump with low efficiency is being used to violate the second law of thermodynamics  but the figure of merit for refrigerator units is not efficiency   n n n nw n n  n n nq n nh n n n n n   displaystyle w q  h   n n  but the coefficient of performance (cop   2  which is  n n n n nq n nc n n n n  n nw n n n   displaystyle q  c  w  n n  a reversible heat engine with low thermodynamic efficiency   n n n nw n n  n n nq n nh n n n n n   displaystyle w q  h   n n delivers more heat to the hot reservoir for a given amount of work when it is being driven as a heat pump   having established that the heat flow values shown in the figure are correct  carnot s theorem may be proven for irreversible and the reversible heat engines  3   to see that every reversible engine operating between reservoirs \n n n n nt n n1 n n n n n   displaystyle t  1   n n and \n n n n nt n n2 n n n n n   displaystyle t  2   n n must have the same efficiency  assume that two reversible heat engines have different values of \n n n n u03b7 n n n   displaystyle   eta   n n  and let the more efficient engine  m  drive the less efficient engine  l  as a heat pump  as the figure shows  this will cause heat to flow from the cold to the hot reservoir without any external work or energy  which violates the second law of thermodynamics  therefore both  reversible  heat engines have the same efficiency  and we conclude that   this is an important result because it helps establish the clausius theorem  which implies that the change in entropy is unique for all reversible processes   4   over all paths  from a to b in v-t space   if this integral were not path independent  then entropy  s  would lose its status as a state variable  5   if one of the engines is irreversible  it must be the  m  engine  placed so that it reverse drives the less efficient but reversible  l  engine  but if this irreversible engine is more efficient than the reversible engine   i e   if \n n n n n u03b7\n nm n n n gt  n n u03b7 n nl n n n n n   displaystyle   eta   m  gt   eta   l   n n   then the second law of thermodynamics is violated  and  since the carnot cycle represents a reversible engine  we have the first part of carnot s theorem   the efficiency of the engine is the work divided by the heat introduced to the system or  \n n n n u03b7\n  n n n nw n nc ny n n n nq n nh n n n n n  n n n n nq n nh n n n u2212\n nq n nc n n n n nq n

 (1   where wcy is the work done per cycle  thus  the efficiency depends only on qc qh   because all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient  any reversible
