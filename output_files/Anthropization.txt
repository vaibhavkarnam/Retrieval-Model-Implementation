Anthropization
 in geography and ecology  anthropization is the conversion of open spaces  landscapes  and natural environments by human action  1   anthropic erosion is the process of human action degrading terrain and soil   an area may be classified as anthropized even though it looks natural  such as grasslands that have been deforested by humans  it can be difficult to determine how much a site has been anthropized in the case of urbanization because one must be able to estimate the state of the landscape before significant human action  citation needed       with the continually-growing population of humans  the land that the earth provides has been appropriated over the years  the ecological footprint created by anthropization is continually growing despite efficiency and technique improvements made in anthropization    whether anthropized or not  all land seldom a few locations has been claimed  outside of the largely inhospitable arctic and antarctic circles and large portions of other uninhabitable landscapes  much of the globe has been used or altered in some direct way by humans  land has been appropriated for many different reasons  but ultimately the outcome is typically a short-term benefit for humans  an area is anthropized is some way to make land available for housing  to harvest the resources  to create space for some anthropological reason  or many other possibilities   the root of many early forms of civilization  agriculture has been a primary reason for anthropization  in order to cultivate food or breed animals  land needs to be altered to support this  this could mean that soil is tilled or structures are built in order to facilitate the agriculture  this can lead to soil erosion and pollution  pesticides  greenhouse gas emissions  etc    and subsequently habitat fragmentation and overall an increased ecological footprint  it is also worth noting that the line between agriculture and industry often overlaps  and many of these effects take place as a result of industry as well   especially with approximately 7.5 billion humans inhabiting the earth  2  this typically aligns with an increase in residences worldwide  over the years  land has been built upon in order to meet the needs and wants of humans  this can range from small villages to massive factories  water parks to apartments  the process of urbanization and the development of human residences can significantly affect the environment  not only does the physical space of buildings fragment habitats and possibly endanger species  but it fundamentally alters the habitat for any other living being  for some species  this effect can be inconsequential  but for many this can have a dramatic impact  the biosphere is very much interconnected  and this means that if one organism is affected  then as a result the other organisms within this ecosystem and food chain are also affected   as well  within the last century  with any urbanized area there also needs to be roads to support transportation  this transportation is a continued source of pollution and the roads are a large source of soil erosion   in order to support humans  industrial buildings and processes are apparently essential  to create more urban development  and to aid agriculture  many products need to be processed  refined  or constructed  the key component to this is that in order to have factories  the materials used to create a product need to be gathered  for the wide range of products that have been created and refined in this anthropological age  there is a plethora of substances that are harvested  many of these materials are non-renewable  e g  fossil fuel  metal ores  etc   and the harvest of these results in relatively permanent anthropization  for resources that are depended on in high quantity  this can also mean temporary depletion or damage to the source of the resource  e g  depletion or pollution of fresh water reserves  3  improper or inefficient silviculture  etc    even sustainable or renewable industrial anthropization still affects the environment  while the resource in question may not be in jeopardy  the harvest and processing of this can still cause severe change and damage to the environment   anthropization can also be a result of scientific endeavours  this can manifest as construction of structures to aid in scientific discovery and observation  this can range from structures such as observatories  or on the opposite scale the large hadron collider  these and many other things are built and used to enhance knowledge of sciences  they do however require space and energy in order to exist   to power the ever-growing human race  energy is needed  power-harvesting structures are built to harness energy  such as dams  windmills  and nuclear reactors  these sources of energy ultimately fuel the rest of anthropological activity and are essential in this way  however many of these methods have consequences  with dams  construction aside  they can cause flooding  habitat fragmentation  and other effects  with nuclear reactors  they have a lasting effect in that typically a lifespan of one of these is around 50 years 4  and afterwards the nuclear waste needs to be dealt with and the structure itself needs to be shut down and cannot be used further  to safely dispose of this even low-level waste can take hundreds of years  ranging upwards with increased radioactivity  5  to produce and as a result of this production of energy  it requires a lot of anthropized land   obviously the change in population has a direct effect on the anthropological impact  but changes in technology and knowledge have greatly changed anthropization throughout the holocene  the tools that have been developed and the evolution of the methods that humans use in order to anthropize have changed drastically  for examples  the great pyramids in egypt were not constructed by some large machine  instead by thousands of humans  they were still able to build massive monuments  but the efficiency and also the environmental damage as a result of their efforts is much different than today  this is just an example  however  it does show that the environmental effect of modern anthropization is generally greater  not just because of the sizable increase in population when comparing today to ancient egypt  the pollution and loss of biodiversity was largely natural  not man-made  and the anthropization existed on a much lower level   as the population of the earth continues to increase for the foreseeable future  this anthropization will continue to evolve
