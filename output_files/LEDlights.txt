LEDlights
 an led lamp is a light-emitting diode  led  product which is assembled into a lamp  or light bulb  for use in lighting fixtures  led lamps have a lifespan and electrical efficiency which are several times greater than incandescent lamps  and are significantly more efficient than most fluorescent lamps  1][2][3  with some chips able to emit more than 300 lumens per watt  as claimed by cree and some other led manufacturers   4  the led lamp market is projected to grow by more than twelve-fold over the next decade  from $2 billion in the beginning of 2014 to $25 billion in 2023  a compound annual growth rate  cagr  of 25%.[5  as of 2016  leds use only about 10  of the energy an incandescent lamp requires  6   like incandescent lamps and unlike most fluorescent lamps  e g  tubes and compact fluorescent lamps or cfls   leds come to full brightness without need for a warm-up time  the life of fluorescent lighting is also reduced by frequent switching on and off  7  the initial cost of led is usually higher  degradation of led dye and packaging materials reduces light output to some extent over time   some led lamps are made to be a directly compatible drop-in replacement for incandescent or fluorescent lamps  an led lamp packaging may show the lumen output  power consumption in watts  color temperature in kelvins or description  e g   warm white    operating temperature range  and sometimes the equivalent wattage of an incandescent lamp of similar luminous output   most leds do not emit light in all directions  and their directional characteristics affect the design of lamps  although omnidirectional lamps which radiate light over a 360\xb0 angle are becoming more common  the light output of single led is less than that of incandescent and compact fluorescent lamps  in most applications multiple leds are used to form a lamp  although high-power versions  see below  are becoming available   led chips require controlled direct current  dc  electrical power and an appropriate circuit as an led driver is required to convert the alternating current from the power supply to the regulated voltage direct current used by the leds  leds are adversely affected by high temperature  so led lamps typically include heat dissipation elements such as heat sinks and cooling fins   led drivers are the essential components of led lamps or luminaries  a good led driver can guarantee a long life for an led system and provide additional features such as dimming and control  the led drivers can be put inside lamp or luminaire  which is called a built-in type  or be put outside  which is called an independent type  according to different applications  different types of led drivers need to be applied  for example an outdoor driver for street light  an indoor point driver for a down light  and an indoor linear driver for a panel light       before electric lighting became common in the early 20th century  people used candles  gas lights  oil lamps  and fires  humphry davy developed the first incandescent light in 1802  followed by the first practical electric arc light in 1806.[8  by the 1870s  davy s arc lamp had been successfully commercialized  and was used to light many public spaces  the development of a steadily glowing filament suitable for interior lighting took longer  but by the early twentieth century inventors had successfully developed options  replacing the arc light with incandescent lights   the first leds were developed in the early 1960s  however  they were low-powered and only produced light in the low  red frequencies of the spectrum  the first high-brightness blue led was demonstrated by shuji nakamura of nichia corporation in 1994.[9  the existence of blue leds and high-efficiency leds led to the development of the first  white led   which employed a phosphor coating to partially convert the emitted blue light to red and green frequencies creating a light that appears white  10  isamu xa0akasaki  hiroshi xa0amano and nakamura were later awarded the 2014 nobel prize in physics for the invention of the blue led  11   in the usa  the energy independence and security act  eisa  of 2007 authorized the department of energy  doe  to establish the bright tomorrow lighting prize competition  known as the  l prize   12  the first government-sponsored technology competition designed to challenge industry to develop replacements for 60 w incandescent lamps and par 38 halogen lamps  the eisa legislation established basic requirements and prize amounts for each of the two competition categories  and authorized up to $20 million in cash prizes  13  the competition also included the possibility for winners to obtain federal purchasing agreements  utility programs  and other incentives  in may 2008  they announced details of the competition and technical requirements for each category  lighting products meeting the competition requirements could use just 17  of the energy used by most incandescent lamps in use today  that same year the doe also launched the energy star program for solid-state lighting products  the eisa legislation also authorized an additional l prize program for developing a new "21st century lamp    philips lighting ceased research on compact fluorescents in 2008 and began devoting the bulk of its research and development budget to solid-state lighting  14  on 24 september 2009  philips lighting north america became the first to submit lamps in the category to replace the standard 60 w a-19  edison screw fixture  light bulb  15  with a design based on their earlier  ambientled  consumer product  on 3 august 2011  doe awarded the prize in the 60 w replacement category to a philips  led lamp after 18 months of extensive testing  16   early led lamps varied greatly in chromaticity from the incandescent lamps they were replacing  a standard was developed  ansi c78.377-2008  that specified the recommended color ranges for solid-state lighting products using cool to warm white leds with various correlated color temperatures  17  in june 2008  nist announced the first two standards for solid-state lighting in the united states  these standards detail performance specifications for led light sources and prescribe test methods for solid-state lighting products   also in 2008 in the united states and canada  the energy star program began to label lamps that meet a set of standards for starting time  life expectancy  color  and consistency of performance  the intent of the program is to reduce consumer concerns due to variable quality of products  by providing transparency and standards for the labeling and usability of products available in the market  18  energy star light bulbs for consumers is a resource for finding and comparing energy star qualified lamps  a similar program in the united kingdom  run by the energy saving trust  was launched to identify lighting products that meet energy conservation and performance guidelines  19   the illuminating engineering society of north america  iesna  in 2008 published a documentary standard lm-79  which describes the methods for testing solid-state lighting products for their light output  lumens   efficacy  lumens per watt  and chromaticity   in january 2009  it was reported that researchers at cambridge university had developed an led lamp that costs \xa32  about $3 u s    is 12 times as energy efficient as a tungsten lamp  and lasts for 100,000 hours  20  honeywell electrical devices and systems  ed amp s  recommend worldwide usage of led lighting as it is energy efficient and can help save the climate  21   as of 2016  in the opinion of noah horowitz of the natural resources defense council  new standards proposed by the united states department of energy would likely mean most light bulbs used in the future would be led  22   in 2008 sentry equipment corporation in oconomowoc  wisconsin  us  was able to light its new factory interior and exterior almost solely with leds  initial cost was three times that of a traditional mix of incandescent and fluorescent lamps  but the extra cost was recovered within two years via electricity savings  and the lamps should not need replacing for 20 years  14  in 2009 the manapakkam  chennai office of the indian it company  igate  spent \u20b93,700,000 (us 80,000  to light 57,000\xa0sq xa0ft (5,300\xa0m2  of office space with leds  the firm expected the new lighting to pay for itself fully within 5 years  23   in 2009 the exceptionally large christmas tree standing in front of the turku cathedral in finland was hung with 710 led lamps  each using 2 watts  it has been calculated that these led lamps paid for themselves in three and a half years  even though the lights run for only 48 days per year  24   in 2009 a new highway (a29  was inaugurated in aveiro  portugal  it included the first european public led-based lighting highway  25   by 2010 mass installations of led lighting for commercial and public uses were becoming common  led lamps were used for a number of demonstration projects for outdoor lighting and led street lights  the united states department of energy made several reports available on the results of many pilot projects for municipal outdoor lighting  26  and many additional streetlight and municipal outdoor lighting projects soon followed  27   general-purpose lighting needs white light  leds emit light in a very narrow band of wavelengths  emitting light of a color characteristic of the energy bandgap of the semiconductor material used to make the led  to emit white light from leds requires either mixing light from leds of various colors  or using a phosphor to convert some of the light to other colors   the two simplest methods of producing white light leds are rgb or phosphor  rgb or trichromatic white leds uses multiple led chips emitting red  green  and blue wavelengths  these outputs combine to produce white light  the color rendering index  cri  is poor  typically 25 - 65  due to the narrow range of wavelengths emitted  28   the second basic method uses leds in conjunction with a phosphor to produce complementary colors from a single led  the most common method is to combine a blue led with a yellow phosphor  producing a narrow range of blue wavelengths and a broad band of  yellow  wavelengths actually covering the spectrum from green to red  the cri value can range from less than 70 to over 90  although a wide range of commercial leds of this type have a color rendering index around 82.[28   the colors available from both the basic types of white light led is adjustable to a certain extent  with color temperatures in the range of 2,200 k  matching incandescent lamps  up to 7,000 k are widely available  29  higher cri values can be obtained using more than three led colors to cover a greater range of wavelengths  tunable lighting systems employ banks of colored leds that can be individually controlled  either using separate banks of each color  or multi-chip leds with the colors combined and controlled at the chip level  30   a significant difference from other light sources is that the light is more directional  i e   emitted as a narrower beam  led lamps are used for both general and special-purpose lighting  where colored light is needed  leds that inherently emit light of a single color require no energy-absorbing filters   white-light led lamps have longer life expectancy and higher efficiency  more light for the same electricity  than most other lighting when used at the proper temperature  led sources are compact  which gives flexibility in designing lighting fixtures and good control over the distribution of light with small reflectors or lenses  because of the small size of leds  control of the spatial distribution of illumination is extremely flexible  32  and the light output and spatial distribution of an led array can be controlled with no efficiency loss   leds using the color-mixing principle can emit a wide range of colors by changing the proportions of light generated in each primary color  this allows full color mixing in lamps with leds of different colors  33  unlike other lighting technologies  led emission tends to be directional  or at least lambertian   which can be either advantageous or disadvantageous  depending on requirements  for applications where non-directional light is required  either a diffuser is used  or multiple individual led emitters are used to emit in different directions   experiments unraveled surprising performance and production of vegetables and ornamental plants under led light sources  34  a large number of plant species have been assessed in greenhouse trials to make sure that the quality of biomass and biochemical ingredients of such plants is comparable with  or even higher than  those grown in field conditions  plant performance of mint  basil  lentil  lettuce  cabbage  parsley and carrot was measured by assessing both the health and vigor of the plants and the success of the leds in promoting growth  also noticed was profuse flowering of select ornamentals including primula  marigold and stock  34][35  nlight emitting diodes  leds  offer efficient electric lighting in desired wavelengths  red blue  which support greenhouse production in minimum time and with high quality and quantity  as leds are cool  plants can be placed as close as possible to light sources without overheating or scorching  this will save a large amount of space for intense cultivation   led lamps are made of arrays of smd modules that replace incandescent or compact fluorescent lamps  mostly replacing incandescent lamps rated from 5 to 60 watts  such lamps are made with standard lamp connections and shapes  such as an edison screw base  an mr16 shape with a bi-pin base  or a gu5.3  bi-pin cap  or gu10  bayonet fitting  and are made compatible with the voltage supplied to the sockets  they include driver circuitry to rectify the ac power and convert the voltage to an appropriate value  usually a switched-mode power supply   as of 2010 update  some led lamps replaced higher wattage bulbs  for example  one manufacturer claimed a 16-watt led lamp was as bright as a 150\xa0w halogen lamp  1  a standard general-purpose incandescent bulb emits light at an efficiency of about 14 to 17 lumens w depending on its size and voltage  according to the european union standard  an energy-efficient lamp that claims to be the equivalent of a 60\xa0w tungsten lamp must have a minimum light output of 806 lumens  36   some models of led lamps are compatible with dimmers as used for incandescent lamps  37  led lamps often have directional light characteristics  these lamps are more power-efficient than compact fluorescent lamps 38][better xa0source xa0needed  and offer lifespans of 30,000 or more hours  reduced if operated at a higher temperature than specified  incandescent lamps have a typical life of 1,000 hours  39  and compact fluorescents about 8,000 hours  40  the lamps maintain output light intensity well over their lifetimes  energy star specifications require the lamps to typically drop less than 10  after 6,000 or more hours of operation  and in the worst case not more than 15%.[41  led lamps are available with a variety of color properties  the purchase price is higher than most other  but the higher efficiency may make total cost of ownership  purchase price plus cost of electricity and changing bulbs  lower  15   several companies offer led lamps for general lighting purposes  the technology is improving rapidly and new energy-efficient consumer led lamps are available  42][43   as of 2016 update   in the united states  led lamps are close to being adopted as the mainstream light source 44  because of the falling prices and because 40 and 60 watt incandescent lamps are being phased out  45  in the u s  the energy independence and security act of 2007 effectively bans the manufacturing and importing of most current incandescent lamps  led lamps have decreased substantially in pricing and many varieties are sold with subsidized prices from local utilities   led tube lights are designed to physically fit in fixtures intended for fluorescent tubes  some led tubular lamps are intended to be a drop-in replacement into existing fixtures if appropriate ballast is used  others require rewiring of the fixtures to remove the ballast  an led tube lamp generally uses many individual surface-mounted leds which are directional and require proper orientation during installation as opposed to fluorescent tube lamps which emit light in all directions around the tube  most led tube lights available can be used in place of t8  t10  or t12 tube designations  t8 is d26mm  t10 is d30mm  in lengths of 590\xa0mm (23\xa0in   1,200\xa0mm (47\xa0in  and 1,500\xa0mm (59\xa0in    newer light fittings designed for led lamps  or indeed with long-lived leds built-in  have been coming into use as the need for compatibility with existing fittings diminishes  such lighting does not require each bulb to contain circuitry to operate from mains voltage   white led lamps have achieved market dominance in applications where high efficiency is important at low power levels  some of these applications include flashlights  solar-powered garden or walkway lights  and bicycle lights  monochromatic  colored  led lamps are now commercially used for traffic signal lamps  where the ability to emit bright monochromatic light is a desired feature  and in strings of holiday lights  led automotive lamps are widely used for their long life and small size  allowing for multiple bulbs   improving road safety  led lamps are also becoming popular in homes  especially for bathroom and medicine cabinet lighting   see luminous efficacy for an efficiency chart comparing various technologies   in keeping with the long life claimed for led lamps  long warranties are offered  however  currently there are no standardized testing procedures set by the department of energy in the united states to prove these assertions by each manufacturer  60  one manufacturer warrants lamps for professional use  depending upon type  for periods of  defined   normal use  ranging from 1 year or 2,000 hours  whichever comes first  to 5 years or 20,000 hours  61  a typical domestic led lamp is stated to have an  average life  of 15,000 hours (15 years at 3 hours day   and to support 50,000 switch cycles  62   incandescent and halogen lamps naturally have a power factor of 1  but compact fluorescent and led lamps use input rectifiers and this causes lower power factors  low power factors can result in surcharges for commercial energy users  cfl and led lamps are available with driver circuits to provide any desired power factor  or site-wide power factor correction can be performed  eu standards requires a power factor better than 0.5 for lamp powers up to 25 watt and above 0.9 for higher power lamps  63   energy star is an international standard for energy efficient consumer products  64][65  devices carrying the energy star service mark generally use 20\u201330  less energy than required by us standards  66   energy star led qualifications  67   to qualify for energy star certification  led lighting products must pass a variety of tests to prove that the products will display the following characteristics   many will not work with existing dimmer switches designed for  higher power  incandescent lamps  37   color rendering is not identical to incandescent lamps which emit close to perfect black-body radiation as that from the sun and for what eyes have evolved  a measurement unit called cri is used to express how the light source s ability to render the eight color sample chips compare to a reference on a scale from 0 to 100.[68  leds with cri below 75 are not recommended for use in indoor lighting  69   led lamps may flicker  the effect can be seen on a slow motion video of such a lamp  the extent of flicker is based on the quality of the dc power supply built into the lamp structure  usually located in the lamp base  longer exposures to flickering light contribute to headaches and eye strain  70][71][72   led efficiency and life span drop at higher temperatures  which limits the power that can be used in lamps that physically replace existing filament and compact fluorescent types  thermal management of high-power leds is a significant factor in design of solid state lighting equipment   led lamps are sensitive to excessive heat  like most solid state electronic components  led lamps should be checked for compatibility for use in totally or partially enclosed fixtures before installation as heat build-up could cause lamp failure and or fire   the long life of leds  expected to be about 50 times that of the most common incandescent lamps and significantly longer than fluorescent types  is advantageous for users but will affect manufacturers as it reduces the market for replacements in the distant future  14   the human circadian rhythm can be affected by light sources  73][74  the effective color temperature of daylight is ~5,700k 75   bluish white  while tungsten lamps are ~2,700k (yellow   76  people who have circadian rhythm sleep disorders are sometimes treated with light therapy  exposure to intense blueish white light during the day  and dark therapy  wearing amber-tinted goggles at night to reduce blueish light   77][78][79   some organizations recommend that people should not use bluish white lamps at night  the american medical association argues against using bluish white leds for municipal street lighting  80   research suggests that since the shift to led street lighting attracts 48  more flying insects than hps lamps  which could cause direct ecological impacts as well as indirect impacts such as attracting more gypsy moths to port areas that have ships that could give the pests a transoceanic pathway  81  these moths cause forest defoliation that impacts birds and causes economic losses  82][83   the term  efficiency droop  refers to the decrease in luminous efficacy of leds as the electric current increases above tens of milliamps  ma   instead of increasing current levels  luminance is usually increased by combining multiple leds in one lamp  solving the problem of efficiency droop would mean that household led lamps would require fewer leds  which would significantly reduce costs   in addition to being less efficient  operating leds at higher electric currents creates higher heat levels which compromise the lifetime of the led  because of this increased heating at higher currents  high-brightness leds have an industry standard of operating at only 350\xa0ma  350\xa0ma is a good compromise between light output  efficiency  and longevity  84][85][86][87  thermal management of high-power leds often involves using heat sinks to keep the junction temperature at lower levels   early suspicions were that the led droop was caused by elevated temperatures  scientists proved the opposite to be true that  although the life of the led would be shortened  elevated temperatures actually improved the efficiency of the led  88  the mechanism causing efficiency droop was identified in 2007 as auger recombination  which was taken with mixed reaction  87  in 2013  a study conclusively identified auger recombination as the cause of efficiency droop  89
