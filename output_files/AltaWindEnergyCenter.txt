AltaWindEnergyCenter
 alta wind energy center  awec   also known as mojave wind farm  is the third largest onshore wind energy project in the world  the alta wind energy center is a wind farm located in tehachapi pass of the tehachapi mountains  in kern county  california  as of 2013  it is the largest wind farm in the united states  1  with a combined installed capacity of 1,547\xa0mw (2,075,000\xa0hp   the project  being developed near tehachapi pass wind farm u2014 site of the first large-scale wind farms installed in the u s  in the 1970s and 1980s u2014is  a powerful illustration of the growing size and scope of modern wind projects   2][3   southern california edison has agreed to a 25-year power purchase agreement for the power produced as part of the power purchase agreements for up to 1,500\xa0mw (2,000,000\xa0hp  or more of power generated from new projects to be built in the tehachapi area  the project will  reduce carbon dioxide emissions by more than 5.2 million metric tons  which is equivalent to taking 446,000 cars off the road   2  a total of 3,000\xa0mw (4,000,000\xa0hp  is planned  4   the wind farm is being developed by terra-gen power which closed a us 1.2\xa0billion financing deal in july 2010 with partners that included citibank  barclays capital  and credit suisse  after many delays  the first phase began construction in 2010  financing for additional phases of $650 million was secured in april 2012  construction of the alta wind energy center is expected to create more than 3,000\xa0domestic manufacturing  construction  and maintenance jobs  and contribute more than one billion dollars to the local economy  2       the original  alta-oak creek mojave project  plan consisted of up to 320\xa0wind turbines occupying a 9,000-acre (36\xa0km2  area while producing 800\xa0mw (1,100,000\xa0hp  of power  that project was originally developed by oak creek energy systems under the contract with terra-gen  but the project development was later transferred to terra-gen  the project then became the first development under the umbrella of alta wind energy center  5   the alta-oak creek mojave project is generally located at the south side of the oak creek road  starting a few miles west of the state route 14 in mojave and continuing westward along the oak creek road to the west side of the tehachapi-willow springs road  6   according to the american wind energy association  two initial projects were completed in fall 2010  the 150\xa0mw (200,000\xa0hp  alta ii  vestas  project using 50 3\xa0mw (4,000\xa0hp  generators and the 150\xa0mw alta i project using 100 1.5\xa0mw generators  7  three subsequent projects 150\xa0mw alta iii  102\xa0mw (137,000\xa0hp  alta iv  and 168\xa0mw alta v projects were completed in the 2nd quarter of 2011 using 50  34  and 56 3\xa0mw vestas v-90 wind turbines  alta viii and alta vi projects  comprising 300\xa0mw (400,000\xa0hp   were completed in late 2011 early 2012  alta vii and ix projects comprising 300\xa0mw (400,000\xa0hp   were completed in december 2012  bringing the total to 1,320\xa0mw (1,770,000\xa0hp    but they were renamed to pinyon pines wind i and pinyon pines wind ii  8   138\xa0mw (185,000\xa0hp  alta x and 90\xa0mw (120,000\xa0hp  alta xi are under development with scheduled completion in late 2013  180\xa0mw (240,000\xa0hp  alta xiii in 2019.[9
