TeslaModelS
 the tesla model s is a full-sized all-electric five-door  luxury liftback  produced by tesla inc   and introduced in june 2012.[10  it scored a perfect 5.0 nhtsa automobile safety rating  and  as of march 2017 update   the p100d variant holds the record for the fastest acceleration of any production vehicle from a standstill to 60 mph in motor trend tests  11  the united states environmental protection agency  epa  official range for the 2012 model s performance model equipped with an 85\xa0kwh (310\xa0mj  battery pack is 265 miles (426\xa0km   higher than any other electric car at the time  12][13][14  epa rated its energy consumption at 237.5\xa0watt-hours xa0per xa0kilometer (38\xa0kwh 100\xa0mi or 24\xa0kwh 100\xa0km  for a combined fuel economy of 89 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (2.64\xa0l 100\xa0km or 107\xa0mpg u2011imp   12][15   in 2016  tesla updated the design of the model s to closely match that of the model x  as of january 2017 update   the following versions are available  60  60d  75  75d  90d and p100d  owners of the earlier 70 and 70d model s have the option to unlock the 75\xa0kwh capacity via a software update  adding up to 19 miles (31\xa0km  per charge  16  the 60 and 60d model s  reintroduced in june 2016  have a us 9,000 option to unlock the full 75\xa0kwh capacity via a software update any time after purchase  17  in august 2016  tesla introduced the p100d as the new top-level model  the p100d model has a 100\xa0kwh battery  a 0\u201360\xa0mph (0\u201397\xa0km h  time of 2.28 seconds  and over 300 miles (485\xa0km  of epa rated range  18   the model s became the first electric car to top the monthly new car sales ranking in any country  twice leading in norway  in september and december 2013;[19][20][21][22  and also in denmark in december 2015.[23  global model s sales passed the 150,000 unit milestone in november 2016  with the u s  as the leading market with 57  of global sales  24  other leading country markets are norway  china  hong kong  the netherlands  canada  denmark  germany  and switzerland  25][26   the tesla model s has ranked as the world s best-selling plug-in electric car for two years in a row  2015 and 2016.[26][27  the model s also ranked as the top selling plug-in electric car in the u s  for two years running  2015 and 2016.[28  as of december 2016 update   the model s is the world s second best selling plug-in electric car in history after the nissan leaf  29   the tesla model s won awards including the 2013 world green car of the year  2013 motor trend car of the year  automobile magazine s 2013 car of the year  time magazine best 25 inventions of the year 2012 award and consumer reports top-scoring car in its road testing  in 2015  car and driver named the model s the car of the century  30  after declining to recommend the model s in 2015 due to reliability issues  one year later consumer reports added the car to the magazine s recommended list  31][32   the model s was styled by franz von holzhausen  who previously worked for mazda north american operations  33  the car was codenamed whitestar during research and preliminary development  1][2][3  it was officially announced in a press release on june 30  2008.[34][35  the prototype vehicle was displayed at a press conference on march 26  2009.[36   in february 2008 it was reported that tesla inc   then tesla motors  was planning to offer a range-extended version of its model s  this version would have included a gasoline engine to extend the driving range of the vehicle  37  but it was removed in later revisions  at the goinggreen conference in september 2008 tesla s ceo  elon musk  announced that tesla was developing only electric cars  38   construction of an assembly factory in albuquerque  new mexico  a central location for shipping  was supposed to begin in april 2007  but was cancelled  39  a factory to be built in san jose  california was also announced  40][41][42  in may 2010 tesla announced it would produce the model s at the former nummi assembly plant in fremont  california  43  now known as the tesla factory  this third plan was implemented   in june 2015  three years after the model s introduction and with almost 75,000 model s sedans delivered worldwide  tesla announced that model s owners have accumulated over 1 billion electric miles (1.6 billion km  traveled  and saved more than half a million tons of co2.[44][45  the tesla model s is the first plug-in electric vehicle to reach that milestone  in october 2014 general motors reported that volt owners had accumulated a total of 629 million all-electric miles  over 1 billion kilometers  out of a total of 1 billion miles (1.6 billion km  traveled  while nissan reported in december 2014 that leaf owners had traveled 625 million miles (1 billion kilometers   45  tesla also reported that 68  of model s travel took place in north america  25  in europe and 7  in asia-pacific  45  global model s sales passed the 100,000 unit milestone in december 2015,[46  and the 150,000 mark in november 2016.[24   in 2016  a racing series called the  electric gt world series  was promoted in preparation for a 2017 racing season using the p85  as a race car on certain traditional tracks  the first season is planned to have 20 cars in 10 teams  47   in april 2016  a refreshed model s was introduced  the front fascia has a similar design as the model x  and also adaptive led headlights were introduced  also  the improved model s has a hepa air filtration system that removes at least 99.97  of particulate exhaust pollution and all allergens  bacteria  and other contaminants from cabin air  the standard charger was upgraded from 40 to 48 amps in order to enable faster charging when connected to higher-amp outlets  two new interior choices were added  figured ash wood and dark ash wood  these improvements were accompanied by a us 1,500 price increase in the base model  48   tesla manufactures the model s at the 5.4 million square foot 49  tesla factory in fremont  california  for the european market  tesla assembles and distributes from its european distribution center in tilburg  the netherlands  50  cars are built and tested in fremont  california  the battery pack  the electric motor and parts are disassembled and shipped separately to tilburg  where the cars are reassembled  51  the center occupies a 203,000\xa0sq xa0ft (18,900\xa0m2  industrial building that also serves as a workshop and spare parts warehouse  tesla expects the model s to  pay back  the energy that went into producing the car in fewer than 10,000 miles (16,000\xa0km   52   the first ten customers received their cars at the fremont factory on june 22  2012 at the official launch  53  production grew from 15\u201320 cars completed week in august 2012[53  to about 1,000 cars per week in 2015.[54   in october 2015  tesla announced the company is negotiating with the chinese government on producing its electric cars domestically  local production has the potential to reduce the sales prices of tesla models by a third  55  a model s starts at us 71,500 in the u s   while in china pricing starts at cn xa5673,000  about us 106,000  after duties and other taxes  56  elon musk clarified that production will remain in the u s   but if there s sufficient local demand for the tesla model 3 in china  a factory could be built in the country as soon as a year after the launch of the new model  production in europe will also depend on the region s demand for the model 3.[57   the model s exists in several versions  differing in energy capacity  battery size   power  motor size   and equipment  it is classified as a fullsize luxury car in the usa  or as a  large car  58  (120 cu ft or more  or  luxury sedan  59  by the epa  the euro car segment classification is s-segment  sports car   60][61  or  oberklasse  in germany  62   the 2012 tesla model s performance model has a three phase  four pole ac induction 416\xa0hp (310\xa0kw  and 443\xa0ft xb7lb (600\xa0n xb7m  rear-mounted electric motor with copper rotor  63  the base model uses a 362\xa0hp (270\xa0kw  and 325\xa0ft xb7lb (440\xa0n xb7m  motor  the company claimed a drag coefficient of cd 0.24,[64  lower than any car when released  65  independent measurement by car and driver in may 2014 bore out tesla s claim by exactly confirming a drag coefficient of cd 0.24.[66   the rear axle has a traditional open differential  models with dual motors also have an open differential on the front axles as well  the front and rear axles have no mechanical linkage \u2013 with dual motors the power distribution among them is controlled electronically  67   the model s p90d has a top speed of 155\xa0mph (249\xa0km h  and it accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour (0 to 97\xa0km h  in 2.8 seconds  despite the lower total motor power  in part due to the improved traction of the all-wheel drive powertrain  the model s p85d  a dual motor all-wheel drive vehicle has a governed top speed of 155\xa0mph (249\xa0km h  68  and it accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour (0 to 97\xa0km h  in 3.2 seconds  tested to 3.1 seconds   under  insane mode   with 1g of acceleration  68][69  new p85ds have an optional  ludicrous mode  hardware package available with the 90\xa0kwh battery upgrade  thus becoming a p90d  that improves the 0 to 60 miles per hour (0 to 97\xa0km h  acceleration to 2.8 seconds and 1.1g  70][71][72  tesla initially reported the total output in the p85d as the arithmetic addition of the maximum power of the individual electric motors at 691\xa0hp (515\xa0kw  but later reported it as 463\xa0hp (345\xa0kw  because the two motors do not give their maximum power at the same time  73   the powertrain also provides regenerative braking power of more than 60\xa0kw which reduces both energy consumption and improves brake lifetime   owners reported many powertrain issues from 2012  improving significantly over the years  74  in july 2015  tesla announced its goal to make the model s powertrain last for one million miles  75   on october 9  2014  tesla announced the introduction of all wheel drive  awd  versions of the model s s 60  85  and p85 models  designated by a d at the end of the model number  76][77][78   on april 8  2015  tesla introduced the model s 70d as its new us 75,000 entry-level car  with all-wheel drive and an improved range of 240 miles (385\xa0km   the 70d replaced the 60 and 60d in the model s lineup  with the latter two models no longer being available for purchase  the p85 option was also dropped  79][80   in the 85d  the rear drive unit is replaced by a smaller one to save cost and weight  while a second motor of similar size is added to the front wheels  this results in an awd car with comparable power and acceleration to the rwd version while keeping the price increase to us 5,000  additionally  the 85d reports a 2  (5-mile  range increase and 11  increase in top speed over the 85[81   because awd from a motor on each axle does not have the inefficiencies of single engine awd systems   in the p85d  the high-power rear drive unit is retained  while a new front drive motor boosts the total power by about 50   this results in a significant increase in acceleration and top speed  the 85\xa0kwh version rose from us 81,070 to us 86,070  while the p85  now the p85d  jumped from us 94,570 to us 105,670  deliveries of the p85d started in december 2014  with the 85d models starting in february 2015  and the 70d models starting in april 2015.[77   on june 9  2016  tesla reintroduced the 60 and 60d  which has a 75\xa0kwh battery  locked out to 60\xa0kwh 82  but upgradable by software  as is the autopilot option  the spring refresh of 2016 also offers the  bioweapon defense mode  airfilter first offered on the model x  83   on august 23  2016  tesla introduced the model s p100d with ludicrous mode as its new us 134,500 top-level car  with all-wheel drive and an improved epa estimated range of 315 miles (505\xa0km   18  this version of the model s is notable for being the first electric vehicle to have a u s  epa estimated range greater than 300 miles (485\xa0km  and for being the fastest accelerating vehicle currently in production  with a 0\u201360\xa0mph (0\u201397\xa0km h  time of 2.5 seconds  when optioned with ludicrous mode  84][85   in 2012  the epa range for the 60\xa0kwh battery pack model was 208\xa0mi (335\xa0km  86  and the 85\xa0kwh battery was 265 miles (426\xa0km   12][87  according to musk  the model s has a battery with twice the energy density of that on the nissan leaf  but the difference in range is more than double  this is also due to other factors such as drag coefficient  weight  motor efficiency and rolling resistance  88  musk stated that driving at 65\xa0mph (105\xa0km h   under normal conditions  gives a reasonable range of 250 miles (400\xa0km   89   the energy-saving sleep state powers off the display and other vehicle electronics  after the car goes to sleep  this increases the time it takes the touchscreen and instrument panel to become usable  this mode can decrease the loss of the car s range when not being used (2.3\xa0mi  3.7\xa0km per day  as of 2013[update    90   the 85\xa0kwh battery pack weighs 1,200\xa0lb (540\xa0kg  91][better xa0source xa0needed  and contains 7,104 lithium-ion battery cells in 16 modules 92  wired in series (14 in the flat section and two stacked on the front   93  each module contains 6 groups 94  of 74 cells 95  wired in parallel  the 6 groups are then wired in series within the module  95][96][97][98  as of june 2012 update   the battery pack used modified panasonic cells with nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathodes  4  each cell was of the 18650 form factor  i e   an 18\xa0mm diameter  65\xa0mm height cylinder   similar to the panasonic ncr18650b cell that has an energy density of 265\xa0wh kg  99  analysts estimate battery cost to be around 21\u201322  of the car cost  100  list price for a replacement battery was us 44,000 in february 2015.[101   the battery is guaranteed for eight years or 125,000 miles (200,000\xa0km in metric countries  for the base model with the 60\xa0kwh battery pack  the 85\xa0kwh battery pack is guaranteed for eight years and unlimited miles  102][103  a poll among drivers indicate that accumulated battery loss steadies around 5  after 30,000 miles (50,000\xa0km   74][104  decreasing further about 1  per additional 30,000 miles  unlike nissan  tesla does not specify a limit for battery loss  but some early battery packs have been replaced  101][105   a separate battery replacement guarantee takes effect after the eighth year at a cost of us 10,000 for the 60\xa0kwh battery and us 12,000 for the 85\xa0kwh battery  106   in 2013  tesla canceled a 40\xa0kwh version of the car due to lack of demand  stating that only 4  of pre-orders were for the 40\xa0kwh battery option  customers who ordered this option instead received the 60\xa0kwh pack  with charge software-limited to 40\xa0kwh (139 miles  224\xa0km 107    it has the improved acceleration and top speed of the bigger pack and can be upgraded to use the full 60\xa0kwh for us 11,000.[108   on april 8  2015  tesla discontinued the model s 60  and replaced the base model with the model s 70.[109   in 2015  tesla introduced a 70\xa0kwh battery to replace the existing 60\xa0kwh batteries and base 60\xa0kwh model s vehicles  as the 60 was low margin and not sufficiently welcomed by customers  110][111  all 70\xa0kwh cars can be had with rear-wheel drive or all wheel drive  112  the 60 was re-introduced in 2016 as a software-limited 75  upgradable to 75   in july 2015  tesla introduced its 70  90  90d and p90d variants along with a  ludicrous mode  for the performance model  the p90d combines a front axle power of 259 horsepower (193\xa0kw  and rear axle power of 503 horsepower (375\xa0kw  to a total of 762 horsepower (568\xa0kw   for a 0\u201360\xa0mph time of 2.8 sec  the acceleration of the p90d can reach 1.1g  described by tesla as  faster than falling   75  the  ludicrous mode  costs us 10,000 for p90d  but was discounted to us 5,000 plus labor for p85d owners until january 2016.[113   tesla described its july 2015 introduction of the 90\xa0kwh battery as a  range upgrade  of the 85\xa0kwh battery and explained that the 6  energy increase was due to  improved cell chemistry  75  and the introduction of silicon into the cell s graphite anode  115  tesla additionally announced its expectation of an annual improvement in battery capacity of about 5   tesla also explained that apart from the p90d the model s has its main battery conductor protected by a fuse rated for 1,300\xa0a and that this rating is somewhat conservative given the uncertainty of the exact conditions under which a fuse melts  to reduce this uncertainty tesla has for the p90d introduced inconel battery contactors 116  and an electronically controlled pyro-activated fuse  which monitors the current at the millisecond level  cuts the power with  extreme precision and certainty  and has a rating of 1,500\xa0a  75   in february 2016  the 85 kwh battery option was discontinued in countries including the us  australia and canada  117   in march 2016  media reported that a firmware version distributed for the tesla model s had support for a p100d variant that was yet to come  118  this battery is more complicated to make than the 90 version  119  the p100d was released in august 2016.[18   the model s is notable for being designed solely with an electric powertrain in mind  unlike other vehicles where the manufacturer has simply swapped out or supplanted an internal combustion engine with an electric motor  120  as a result  the model s is able to offer unique features such as a front trunk   frunk   in addition to a spacious rear trunk  with a capacity of 894 liters  and a greatly enlarged front crumple zone compared to the typical combustion engine powered vehicle  84   to enhance livability  tesla has developed a network of fast-charging  supercharger  stations that allow the driver to quickly and easily top-up the charge on their model s  84  this supercharger network has rapidly expanded in europe  across the united states  and other countries where there is significant demand  and as of september 2016 update   the network has been established in most american states  thus making cross-country and long distance trips in an electric vehicle feasible and greatly alleviating fears of range anxiety  84  see the supercharger section below for further information   researchers from the university of california  davis conducted a study to identify the factors influencing the decision to adopt high-end battery electric vehicles  bev   such as the tesla model s  as these vehicles are remarkably different from mainstream bevs  the 2016 study found that  environmental  performance  and technological motivations are reasons for adoption  the new technology brings a new segment of buyers into

official ratings for fuel economy in miles per gallon gasoline equivalent  mpge  and epa s estimated out-of-pocket fuel costs for the variants of the model s rated as of 30 december 2015 update  and as displayed in the monroney label   in contrast to most other battery electric vehicles including the roadster  the battery pack of the model s forms the floor of the vehicle between the axles  providing the vehicle with several advantages  most notably  since the battery pack is the single heaviest component of the vehicle  the model s has a center of gravity height of only 18 inches (46\xa0cm  91][132   about the same as a lotus elise   133  helping it to achieve a lateral acceleration of 0.9g 134  and good protection against rollover  135][136  secondly  the absence of a heavy engine between the front or rear axle allows the bulk of the mass to be centralized between the axles  lowering rotational inertia allowing it to turn more quickly for its weight  thirdly  the placement of the battery pack increases the rigidity of the passenger compartment  improving the passive safety of the vehicle  137  fourth  placing the battery pack under the vehicle makes it possible to remove or replace the entire unit in 90 seconds  138  either for maintenance or for tesla s battery swap service   in all markets the charge port is located behind a door in the left

systems   the standard north american onboard charger accepts single phase 120 or 240-volt sources at a rate of up to 10 kw  included adapters allow the car to charge from a standard 120 volt outlet  a 240 volt nema 14-50 outlet  and sae j1772 public chargers  an optional us 2,000 upgrade for a second 10 kw onboard charger supports a total of up to 20 kw charging from an 80 amp available us 750 tesla wall connector  4  the north american connector uses a proprietary tesla design   charging times vary depending on the battery pack s state-of-charge  its overall capacity  the available voltage  and the available circuit breaker amperage  from a 120 volt 15 amp household outlet  the range increases by 3.75 miles (6\xa0km  for every hour of charging  from a 10 kw  nema 14\u201350 240 v 50 a

tesla wall connector is expected to be available in the second quarter of 2016.[141   the model s has independent coil spring suspension on all four wheels xa0\u2013 front double wishbone  virtual steer axis control arm and rear independent multilink  63  as an extra-cost option  the car is available with self-leveling  height-adjustable air suspension  this is accomplished via adjustable bilstein shock absorbers controlled by the driver  the car is meant to lower itself at highway speed and raise itself to traverse steep driveways and rough terrain  despite the low 6-inch ground clearance and rather long 116-inch wheelbase  142   because  in the tesla  electronic systems can be upgraded by  over-the-air  download  rather than recall  the suspension system has been changed retroactively on several occasions  during the 2013  fire investigation   nhtsa asked tesla to disable the car s ability to lower itself at speed on the theory that a ground clearance below 6 inches might cause the batteries underneath the car to contact road debris  143  in september 2014  tesla upgraded the height adjustment feature for model s cars equipped with air suspension to remember locations that require higher clearance such as those with potholes and steep driveways  and automatically adjusts to avoid them  144   beginning in late september 2014  all new model s vehicles come equipped with a camera  supplied by mobileye  mounted at the top of the windshield  forward looking radar  supplied by bosch  145][146  in the lower grill  and ultrasonic acoustic location sensors in the front and rear bumpers that provide a 360-degree buffer zone around the car  this equipment allows model s to detect road signs  lane markings  obstacles  and other vehicles  in addition to adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning  a us 2,500  tech package  option will allow this system to enable semi-autonomous drive and parking capabilities  147][148][149  all model s sold since october 2014 have the option to have autopilot  which allows limited hands-free driving  autopilot-enabled cars receive software updates for the autopilot software wirelessly  just as all other model s cars receive general software updates wirelessly   according to elon musk  the model s was designed to be a computer on wheels   we really designed the model s to be a very sophisticated computer on wheels  tesla is a software company as much as it is a hardware company  a huge part of what tesla is  is a silicon valley software company  we view this the same as updating your phone or your laptop   150  full autonomy is \u201creally a software limitation  the hardware exists to create full autonomy  so it u2019s really about developing advanced  narrow ai for the car to operate on  u201c 151][152   tesla s autonomous driving features are ahead of production cars  and its autopilot can be classified as somewhere between levels 2 and 3 under the u s  department of transportation u2019s national highway traffic safety administration  nhtsa  five levels of vehicle automation  at this level  the car can act autonomously but requires the full attention of the driver  who must be prepared to take control at a moment s notice  153][154][155  autopilot is suitable only on limited-access highways  and sometimes it will fail to detect lane markings and disengage itself  in urban driving the system will not read traffic signals or obey stop signs  the system also does not detect pedestrians or cyclists  156   starting october 2016  all tesla cars are built with the necessary hardware to allow full self-driving capability at a safety level  sae level 5).[157  the system will operate in  shadow mode   processing without taking action  and send data back to tesla to improve its abilities until the software is ready for deployment via over-the-air upgrades  158  tesla says it expects to enable full self-driving by the end of 2017  after proper testing  157   the first known fatal accident involving a tesla model s when the car was in autopilot mode took place in williston  florida on 7 may 2016  the driver was killed in a crash with a large 18-wheel tractor-trailer

the sales tax having to be paid up front  delivery of a tesla car to a texas address is no different than in other states  370  consequently  while tesla showcases and sells its cars directly to the

without injury   383  he then contacted authorities and  while awaiting their arrival  smoke began coming out the front of the vehicle  the driver stated that he hit something while exiting the hov lane  382][384][385  tesla stated that the fire was caused by the  direct impact of a large metallic object to one of the 16 battery modules   and that by design  the modules were separated by firewalls  limiting the fire to  a small section in the front of the vehicle   382   the module was evidently punctured by a  curved section  that fell off a truck and was recovered near the accident  tesla stated that the debris punched a 3-inch (76\xa0mm  diameter hole through the .25-inch (6.4\xa0mm  armor plate under the vehicle  applying force of some 25 tons  built-in vents directed the flames away from the vehicle so that the fire did not enter the passenger compartment  according to tesla  the firefighters followed standard procedure  using large amounts of water to extinguish the fire was correct  386  however  puncturing the metal firewall to gain access to the fire also allowed the flames to spread to the front trunk  383  tesla also stated that because the battery pack contains  only about 10  of the energy contained in a gasoline tank   the effective combustion potential of a single module is only about 1  that of a conventional vehicle  383   on october 24  2013  the u s  national highway traffic safety administration  nhtsa  announced   after reviewing all available data  the national highway traffic safety administration has not found evidence at this time that would indicate the recent battery fire involving a tesla model s was the result of a vehicle safety defect or noncompliance with federal safety standards   387  but the following month  the nhtsa opened a preliminary evaluation to determine  the potential risks associated with undercarriage strikes on model year 2013 tesla model s vehicles   388][389  on march 28  2014  nhtsa closed its investigation  claiming that the new titanium underbody shield and aluminum deflector plates  along with increased ground clearance   should reduce both the frequency of underbody strikes and the resultant fire risk   390   on november 6  2013 another fire broke out after a model s struck a tow hitch on the roadway  causing damage beneath the vehicle  391  the incidents led tesla to extend its vehicle warranty to cover fire damage and to apply a software update to increase ground clearance when operating at highway speed  388][392   another fire incident took place in toronto  canada  in early february 2014  the model s was parked in a garage and was not charging when the fire started  the origin of the fire is undetermined  393  according to tesla  in this particular case  we don t yet know the precise cause  but have definitively determined that it did not originate in the battery  the charging system  the adapter or the electrical receptacle  as these components were untouched by the fire   394   starting with vehicle bodies manufactured as of 6 march 2014 update   all units were outfitted with a triple underbody shield  existing cars were retrofitted upon request or as part of a normally scheduled service  395][396   on 1 january 2016  a 2014 model s caught fire in norway while supercharging unsupervised  the vehicle was totally destroyed but nobody was injured  397][398][399  the fire was slow  and the owner had time to unplug the car and retrieve possessions  400  an investigation by the norwegian accident investigation board  aibn  indicated that the fire originated in the car  but was otherwise inconclusive  401  in march 2016  tesla stated that their own investigation into the incident concluded that the fire was caused by a short circuit in the vehicle s distribution box  but that the amount of damage prevented them from determining the exact cause  400  tesla stated that the supercharger detected the short circuit and deactivated  and a future model s software update would stop the vehicle from charging if a short circuit is detected  402   on november 20  2015  tesla announced a voluntary worldwide recall of all of its 90,000 model s vehicles  in order to check for a possible defect in the cars  front seat belt assemblies  the problem was raised in early november by one customer in europe  tesla s resulting investigation was unable to identify a root cause for the failure  and the company decided to examine every single car  tesla reported that there have been no accidents or injuries related to the problem  403][404   tesla recalled model s from 2012 in january 2017 due to the defective takata airbags  cars made later  until 2017  have smaller risk  and may also be recalled  other tesla cars are not affected  405   as of august 2015 update   the distance record is 452.8\xa0mi (728.7\xa0km  in a model s on a single charge  it was made by norwegian bj xf8rn nyland and his friend  morgan t xf8rvolt on a flat

times published a review by john m  broder about a trip between washington  d c   and boston using tesla s supercharger network  at the time it included only two stations on the east coast  broder made a variety of critical claims about the battery s performance in cold weather and the distance between charging stations  the trip ended with the model s carried by a flatbed truck to the milford  connecticut  station  434   tesla responded by publishing logs of the vehicle s charge levels and driving speed that contradicted broder s account on several factual details  435  tesla implied that broder s behavior forced the car to fail  broder replied to the criticism in a blog post and suggested that the speed discrepancies may have been because the car had been equipped with 19-inch wheels rather than the specified 21-inch wheels  436  in the midst of the controversy  a cnn reporter recreated broder s trip without exhausting the battery  however  two key differences distinguished the two journeys  the weather was about 10\xa0\xb0f (6\xa0\xb0c  warmer and cnn did the trip in one day  the times let the car sit overnight without being plugged in  437  a reporter from cnbc also recreated the trip in one day without incidents  438  one week later  a group of tesla owners recreated broder s trip without problems  one owner was delayed because his car failed to charge and required two firmware updates  439][440   on february 18  2013  new york times public editor margaret sullivan published an editorial stating that broder took  casual and imprecise notes  of his test drive and did not use good judgment  but she maintained that the article was done in good faith  she also claimed that broder s vehicle logs were  sometimes quite misleading   441][442][443   in july and september 2014 tests performed by an independent german car magazine in cooperation with the t xdcv  german association for technical inspection  and tesla owners seemed to reveal issues with the

october 2015  two months after naming the tesla  the best car ever tested   consumer reports declined to give the tesla model s a  recommended  designation  citing too many complaints from owners  complaints ranged from minor  such as misaligned doors and squeaky body  to severe - things like total drive train replacement and inoperable door handles  tesla s shares dropped 15   both because of

consumer reports improved the model s rating to average reliability  while reporting that the model x has had significant malfunction issues  the magazine also raised  serious concerns about how some

be aware of road conditions and not rely on the cruise control to prevent a collision  474  as the system may not detect stationary vehicles or obstacles  bicycles  and pedestrians  however  critics such as scientist andrew ng have accused tesla of being irresponsible by releasing a product with such limitations as it can lull drivers into a false sense of security  475   in early march 2016  a report by stuff magazine revealed that test performed by vicom  ltd on behalf of singapore s land transport authority had found a 2014 tesla model s to be consuming 444\xa0wh km (0.715\xa0kw xb7h mi   476][477  which was greater than the 236\xa0wh km (0.38\xa0kw xb7h mi  reported by the u s environmental protection agency (epa  478  and the 181\xa0wh km (0.291\xa0kw xb7h mi  reported by tesla  479  as a result  a carbon surcharge of s 15,000 (us 10,900  was imposed on the model s  making singapore the only country in the world to impose an environmental surcharge on a fully electric car  480  the land transport authority justified this by stating that it had to  account for co2 emissions during the electricity generation process  and therefore  a grid emission factor of 0.5g watt-hour was also applied to the electric energy consumption   481  however tesla countered that when the energy used to extract  refine  and distribute gasoline was taken into account  the model s produces approximately one-third the co2 of an equivalent gasoline-powered vehicle  479   later that month  the land transport authority released a statement stating that they and the vicom emission test laboratory will be working with tesla engineers to determine if there was a flaw in the test  482  and a tesla statement indicated that the discussions were  positive  and that they were confident of a quick resolution  479
