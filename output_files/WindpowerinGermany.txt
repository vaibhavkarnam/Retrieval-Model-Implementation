WindpowerinGermany
 wind power in germany describes wind power in germany as part of energy in germany and renewable energy in germany  in 2015  the installed capacity of wind power in germany was 44,470 megawatts  mw   with wind power producing about 13.3 percent of germany u2019s total electrical power  1  according to ewea in a typical wind year  installed wind capacity in germany was estimated to have met 10.6  at end 2011 and 9.3  at end 2010 of the german electricity needs  2][3  the persistent disparity between ewea estimates for a  normal wind year  and the actual data tabulated below may be due to the ewea relying on an unrealistically high capacity factor for german wind production  citation needed   more than 26,772 wind turbines were located in the german federal area by year end 2015  and the country has plans for further expansion  4][5  as of the end of 2015 germany was the third largest producer of wind power in the world by installations  behind china and the usa  and ahead of india  spain and the united kingdom  6   since 2011  germany s federal government has been working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization  7  with a particular focus on offshore wind farms  8  a major challenge will be the development of sufficient network capacities for transmitting the power generated in the north sea to the large industrial consumers in southern germany  9       in germany  hundreds of thousands of people have invested in citizens  wind farms across the country and thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises are running successful businesses in a new sector that in 2008 employed 90,000 people and generated 8 percent of germany s electricity  10  wind power has gained very high social acceptance in germany  11   as of 2010  wind power in germany provided over 96,100 people with jobs and german wind energy systems are also exported  4][12  the fuhrl xe4nder wind turbine laasow  built in 2006 near the village of laasow  brandenburg  was the tallest wind turbine in the world for six years   in 2016  germany decided to replace feed-in tariffs with auctions from 2017  citing the mature nature of the windpower market being best served in this way  13   repowering  the replacement of first-generation wind turbines with modern multi-megawatt machines  is occurring in germany  modern turbines make better use of available wind energy and so more wind power can come from the same area of land  modern turbines also offer much better grid integration since they use a connection method similar to conventional power plants  14][15   offshore wind energy also has great potential in germany  16  wind speed at sea is 70 to 100  higher than onshore and much more constant  a new generation of 5\xa0mw or larger wind turbines which are capable of making full use of the potential of wind power at sea has already been developed and prototypes are available  this makes it possible to operate offshore wind farms in a cost-effective way once the usual initial difficulties of new technologies have been overcome  17   on 15 july 2009  the first offshore german windturbine completed construction  this turbine is the first of a total of 12 wind turbines for the alpha ventus offshore wind farm in the north sea  18   following the 2011 japanese nuclear accidents  germany s federal government is working on a new plan for increasing renewable energy commercialization  with a particular focus on offshore wind farms  19  under the plan  large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines  where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land  and where the enormous turbines won t bother the inhabitants  the plan aims to decrease germany s dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants  8  the german government wants to see 7.6\xa0gw installed by 2020 and as much as 26\xa0gw by 2030.[20   a major challenge will be the lack of sufficient network capacities for transmitting the power generated in the north sea to the large industrial consumers in southern germany  9   in 2014  all in all 410 turbines with 1747 megawatts were added to germany s offshore windparks  due to not yet finished grid-connections  only turbines with combined 528.9 megawatts were added to the grid feed at the end of 2014  despite this  the gigawatt offshore windpower barrier was reportedly breached by germany around the end of 2014[21  during 2015 offshore windpower was tripled to over 3 gigawatts capacity  signalling the growing importance of this sector  1   the 2010  energiewende  policy has been embraced by the german federal government and has resulted in a huge expansion of renewables  particularly wind power  germany s share of renewables has increased from around 5  in 1999 to 17  in 2010  reaching close to the oecd average of 18  usage of renewables  22  producers have been guaranteed a fixed feed-in tariff for 20 years  guaranteeing a fixed income  energy co-operatives have been created  and efforts were made to decentralize control and profits  the large energy companies have a disproportionately small share of the renewables market  nuclear power plants were closed  and the existing 9 plants will close earlier than necessary  in 2022   the reduction of reliance on nuclear plants has so far had the consequence of increased reliance on fossil fuels and on electricity imports from france  however  in good wind germany exports to france  in january 2015 the average price was \u20ac29 mwh in germany  and \u20ac39 mwh in france  23  one factor that has inhibited efficient employment of new renewable energy has been the lack of an accompanying investment in power infrastructure  s xfcdlink  to bring the power to market  22][24  the transmission constraint sometimes causes germany to pay danish wind power to stop producing  in october november 2015 this amounted to 96 gwh costing 1.8 million euros  25   different l xe4nder have varying attitudes to the construction of new power lines  industry has had their rates frozen and so the increased costs of the energiewende have been passed on to consumers  who have had rising electricity bills  germans in 2013 had some of the highest electricity costs in europe  26   installed wind power capacity and generation in recent years is shown in the table below   in saxony-anhalt 48.11  of electricity was produced with wind power in 2011.[27   share of the potential annual energy yield of the net electrical energy consumption in 2011
