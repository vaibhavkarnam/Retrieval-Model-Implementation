LincsWindFarm
 the lincs wind farm is a 270\xa0mw offshore wind farm 8 kilometres (5.0\xa0mi  off skegness on the east coast of england  the total cost of the project is estimated at \xa31\xa0billion including electrical transmission links  the farm was completed in 2013  it is adjacent to the smaller lynn and inner dowsing wind farm       centrica acquired the lincs wind farm project in 2004 from renewable energy systems  in 2008 the company obtained planning permission for the project  1][2   in december 2009 dong energy and siemens project ventures jointly acquired 50  of the project (25  share each  for \xa350\xa0million  plus 50  of the capital cost of the project  3   preparatory construction work for the development included the extension of the national-grid electricity substation at walpole  norfolk  which began in april 2009.[4  note 1  in june 2010 siemens obtained the contract for the offshore electrical substation (\xa3101\xa0million   7  transmission cables from offshore to onshore electrical substations were installed in 2010\u20132011.[4][8  construction of the offshore facilities of the wind farm began in 2011  with the installation of the offshore electricity substation foundations  9  the port of hull was selected as one of the logistics bases for the wind farm turbine installation  supplying wind tower transition pieces  jack-up barge jb114 arriving at the port in march 2012.[10  great yarmouth was also used as a base for the wind farm installation  11   construction of the offshore 33\xa0kv to 132\xa0kv substation  structure sub-contracted to mcnulty offshore construction atkins plc  12   and of the onshore 132\xa0kv to 400\xa0kv substation was completed by april 2012.[13   in august 2011  the consortia of dong  siemens  and centrica began to seek financing for the \xa31\xa0billion project  committing to providing \xa3166.7  \xa375 and \xa3333.3\xa0million respectively (\xa3575\xa0million total   in june 2012 the consortia obtained financing for the project with \xa3425\xa0million of nonrecourse debt facilities provided from a consortium of 10 banks  approximately 75   of the project cost was for the wind farm installation  the remainder for the high voltage electricity transmission link  14   construction began in 2010  installation of the 75-monopile tower foundation by mt h xf8jgaard was completed by june 2012  with the underwater installation phase completed by september 2012.[15  the first generator had been installed by 14 july 2012.[16  the wind farm was scheduled become operational in the second half of 2012  and be complete by 2013:[17  the final turbine was installed by march 2013;[18  and the wind farm officially opened by deputy prime minister nick clegg in august 2013,[19][20  with commissioning complete in september 2013.[21  the license for the electrical transmission link was awarded to tc lincs ofto limited for \xa3308\xa0million in late 2014.[22   the scheme has 250\xa0mw of generating capacity  with an additional 20\xa0mw of turbine generating capacity constructed within the nearby lynn wind farm and dowsing wind farm but connected to the lincs project transmission system  23  the project uses 75 three blade 3.6\xa0mw siemens wind turbines  the wind turbines have 120 metres (390\xa0ft  rotor diameter machines with 58.5 metres (192\xa0ft  blades with a hub height of 100 metres (330\xa0ft  on cylindrical steel towers  the turbines were installed in 10 to 15 metres (33 to 49\xa0ft  water depth  with a spacing of approximately 500 metres (1,600\xa0ft  within a 35 square kilometres (14\xa0sq xa0mi  wind farm  8   transmission of electrical power to land is by 145\xa0kv cables supplied by nexans  transmission voltage is 132\xa0kv to land  being increased to 400\xa0kv at walpole substation for grid connection  8   the operation and maintenance base for the wind farm is based at grimsby  24   the wind farm has an expected lifespan of 40 years  with electrical equipment and wind turbines expected to be replaced after 20 years  after the end of the project s lifespan the farm is to be decommissioned  including removal of turbines and electrical equipment  and removal of offshore foundations or cut off to seabed level or lower  connecting cables are not scheduled to be removed  25
