states and the third most extensive by area  located on the western  pacific ocean  coast of the u s   california is bordered by the other u s  states of oregon  nevada  and arizona and shares an international border with the mexican state of baja california  the state capital is sacramento  los angeles is california s most populous city  and the country s second largest after new york city  the state also has the nation s most populous county  los angeles county  and its largest county by area  san bernardino county   california s diverse geography ranges from the pacific coast in the west to the sierra nevada mountain range in the east  and from the redwood u2013douglas fir forests in the northwest to the mojave desert in the southeast  the central valley  a major agricultural area  dominates the state s center  though california is well-known for its warm mediterranean climate  the large size of the state means it can vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north  to arid desert in the interior  as well as snowy alpine in the mountains   what is now california was first settled by various native american tribes before being explored by a number of european expeditions during the 16th and 17th centuries  the spanish empire then claimed it as part of alta california in their new spain colony  the area became a part of mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence  but was ceded to the united states in 1848 after the mexican u2013american war  the western portion of alta california then was organized as the state of california  and admitted as the 31st state on september 9  1850  the california gold rush starting in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic changes  with large-scale emigration from the east and abroad with an accompanying economic boom   if it were a country  california would be the 6th largest economy in the world 14  and the 35th most populous  it is also regarded as a global trendsetter in both popular culture and politics  and is the origin of the film industry  the hippie counterculture  the internet  15  and the personal computer  among others  fifty-eight percent of the state s economy is centered on finance  government  real estate services  technology  and professional  scientific and technical business services  16  the san francisco bay area has the nation s highest median household income by metropolitan area  and is the headquarters of three of the world s largest 20 firms by revenue  chevron  apple  and mckesson  17  although it accounts for only 1.5 percent of the state s economy  16  california s agriculture industry has the highest output of any u s  state  18   the word california originally referred to the baja california peninsula of mexico  it was later extended to the entire region composed of the current united states states of california  nevada  and utah  and parts of arizona  new mexico  texas and wyoming  citation needed   the name california is surmised by some writers to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by black amazons and ruled by queen calafia  19][20  who fought alongside muslims and whose name was chosen to echo the title of a muslim leader  the caliph  fictionally implying that california was the caliphate  21  the story of calafia is recorded in a 1510 work the adventures of esplandi xe1n  written as a sequel to amadis de gaula by spanish adventure writer garci rodr xedguez de montalvo  22][23][24  the kingdom of queen calafia  according to montalvo  was said to be a remote land inhabited by griffins and other strange beasts  and rich in gold   know ye that at the right hand of the indies there is an island called california  very close to that part of the terrestrial paradise  which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them  and they lived in the manner of amazons  they were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue  the island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks   when spanish explorer francisco de ulloa was exploring the western coast of north america  his initial surveys of the baja california peninsula led him to believe that it was an island rather than part of the larger continent  so he dubbed the  island  after the mythical island in montalvo s writing  26  this conventional wisdom that california was an island  with maps drawn to reflect this belief  lasted as late as the 1700s  27   shortened forms of the state s name include ca  cal   calif  and us-ca   settled by successive waves of arrivals during the last 10,000 years  california was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-columbian north america  various estimates of the native population range from 100,000 to 300,000.[28  the indigenous peoples of california included more than 70 distinct groups of native americans  ranging from large  settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interior  california groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands  tribes  villages  and on the resource-rich coasts  large chiefdoms  such as the chumash  pomo and salinan  trade  intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse groups   the first european effort to explore the coast as far north as the russian river was a spanish sailing expedition  led by portuguese captain juan rodr xedguez cabrillo  in 1542  some 37 years later english explorer francis drake also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the california coast in 1579  spanish traders made unintended visits with the manila galleons on their return trips from the philippines beginning in 1565.[29  the first asians to set foot on what would be the united states occurred in 1587  when filipino sailors arrived in spanish ships at morro bay  30  sebasti xe1n vizca xedno explored and mapped the coast of california in 1602 for new spain   despite the on-the-ground explorations of california in the 16th century  rodr xedguez s idea of california as an island persisted  that depiction appeared on many european maps well into the 18th century  31   after the portol xe0 expedition of 1769\u201370  spanish missionaries began setting up 21 california missions on or near the coast of alta  upper  california  beginning in san diego  during the same period  spanish military forces built several forts  presidios  and three small towns  pueblos   two of the pueblos grew into the cities of los angeles and san jose  the spanish colonization brought the genocide of the indigenous californian peoples   imperial russia explored the california coast and established a trading post at fort ross  its early 19th-century coastal settlements north of san francisco bay constituted the southernmost russian colony in north america and were spread over an area stretching from point arena to tomales bay  33   in 1821  the mexican war of independence gave mexico  including california  independence from spain  for the next 25 years  alta california remained a remote northern province of the nation of mexico   cattle ranches  or ranchos  emerged as the dominant institutions of mexican california  after mexican independence from spain  the chain of missions became the property of the mexican government and were secularized by 1834.[34  the ranchos developed under ownership by californios  spanish-speaking californians  who had received land grants  and traded cowhides and tallow with boston merchants   from the 1820s  trappers and settlers from the united states and the future canada arrived in northern california  these new arrivals used the siskiyou trail  california trail  oregon trail and old spanish trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding california   between 1831 and 1836  california experienced a series of revolts against mexico  35  this culminated in the 1836 california revolt led by juan bautista alvarado  which ended after mexico appointed him governor of the department  36  the revolt  which had momentarily declared california an independent state  was successful with the assistance of american and british residents of california  37  including isaac graham  38  after 1840  100 of those residents who did not have passports were arrested  leading to the graham affair in 1840.[37   one of the largest ranchers in california was john marsh  after failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the mexican courts  he determined that california should become part of the united states  marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing the california climate  soil and other reasons to settle there  as well as the best route to follow  which became known as  marsh s route   his letters were read  reread  passed around  and printed in newspapers throughout the country  and started the first wagon trains rolling to california  39  he invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled  and assisted in their obtaining passports  40   after ushering in the period of organized emigration to california  marsh helped end the rule of the last mexican governor of california  thereby paving the way to california s ultimate acquisition by the united states  41   in 1846  settlers rebelled against mexican rule during the bear flag revolt  afterwards  rebels raised the bear flag  featuring a bear  a star  a red stripe and the words  california republic   at sonoma  the republic s only president was william b  ide  42  who played a pivotal role during the bear flag revolt   the california republic was short lived  43  the same year marked the outbreak of the mexican u2013american war (1846\u201348).[44  when commodore john d  sloat of the united states navy sailed into monterey bay and began the military occupation of california by the united states  northern california capitulated in less than a month to the united states forces  45  after a series of defensive battles in southern california  the treaty of cahuenga was signed by the californios on january 13  1847  securing american control in california  46   following the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo that ended the war  the western territory of alta california  became the united states state of california  and arizona  nevada  colorado and utah became united states territories  the lightly populated lower region of california  the baja peninsula  remained in the possession of mexico   in 1846  the non-native population of california was estimated to be no more than 8,000  plus about 100,000 native americans down from about 300,000 before hispanic settlement in 1769.[47  after gold was discovered in 1848  the population burgeoned with united states citizens  europeans  chinese and other immigrants during the great california gold rush  by 1854 over 300,000 settlers had come  48  between 1847 and 1870  the population of san francisco increased from 500 to 150,000.[49  on september 9  1850  as part of the compromise of 1850  california was admitted to the united states undivided as a free state  denying the expansion of slavery to the pacific coast   california s native population precipitously declined  above all  from eurasian diseases to which they had no natural immunity  50  as in other states  the native inhabitants were forcibly removed from their lands by incoming miners  ranchers  and farmers  and although california entered the union as a free state  the  loitering or orphaned indians  were de facto enslaved by mexican and anglo-american masters under the 1853 act for the government and protection of indians  51  there were massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed  between 1850 and 1860  california paid around 1.5 million dollars  some 250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government  52  to hire militias whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations  in later decades  the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias  which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them  51  as a result  the rise of california was a calamity for the native inhabitants  several scholars and native american activists  including benjamin madley and ed castillo  have described the actions of the california government as a genocide  53   the seat of government for california under spanish and later mexican rule was located at monterey from 1777 until 1845.[34  pio pico  last mexican governor of alta california  moved the capital to los angeles in 1845  the united states consulate was also located in monterey  under consul thomas o  larkin   in 1849  the constitutional convention was first held in monterey  among the tasks was a decision on a location for the new state capital  the first legislative sessions were held in san jose (1850\u20131851   subsequent locations included vallejo (1852\u20131853   and nearby benicia (1853\u20131854   these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well  the capital has been located in sacramento since 1854[54  with only a short break in 1862 when legislative sessions were held in san francisco due to flooding in sacramento   initially  travel between california and the rest of the continental united states was time consuming and dangerous  a more direct connection came in 1869 with the completion of the first transcontinental railroad through donner pass in the sierra nevada mountains  once completed  hundreds of thousands of united states citizens came west  where new californians were discovering that land in the state  if irrigated during the dry summer months  was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general  vast expanses of wheat  other cereal crops  vegetable crops  cotton  and nut and fruit trees were grown  including oranges in southern california   and the foundation was laid for the state s prodigious agricultural production in the central valley and elsewhere   migration to california accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the lincoln highway and route 66  in the period from 1900 to 1965  the population grew from fewer than one million to become the most populous state in the union  in 1940  the census bureau reported california s population as 6.0  hispanic  2.4  asian  and 89.5  non-hispanic white  55   to meet the population s needs  major engineering feats like the california and los angeles aqueducts  the oroville and shasta dams  and the bay and golden gate bridges were built across the state  the state government also adopted the california master plan for higher education in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education   meanwhile  attracted to the mild mediterranean climate  cheap land  and the state s wide variety of geography  filmmakers established the studio system in hollywood in the 1920s  california manufactured 8.7 percent of total united states military armaments produced during world war ii  ranking third  behind new york and michigan  among the 48 states  56  after world war ii  california s economy greatly expanded due to strong aerospace and defense industries  57  whose size decreased following the end of the cold war  57][58  stanford university and its dean of engineering frederick terman began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in california instead of leaving the state  and develop a high-tech region in the area now known as silicon valley  59  as a result of these efforts  california is regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries  of technology  engineering  and the aerospace industry  and as the united states center of agricultural production  60  just before the  dot com bust  california had the 5th largest economy in the world among nations  61  yet since 1991  and starting in the late 1980s in southern california  california has seen a net loss of domestic migrants most years  this is often referred to by the media as the california exodus  62   however  during the 20th century  two great disasters happened in california  the 1906 san francisco earthquake and 1928 st  francis dam flood remain the deadliest in u s history  63   california is the 3rd largest state in the united states in area  after alaska and texas  65  california is often geographically bisected into two regions  southern california  comprising the 10 southernmost counties  66][67  and northern california  comprising the 48 northernmost counties  68][69   in the middle of the state lies the california central valley  bounded by the sierra nevada in the east  the coastal mountain ranges in the west  the cascade range to the north and by the tehachapi mountains in the south  the central valley is california s productive agricultural heartland   divided in two by the sacramento-san joaquin river delta  the northern portion  the sacramento valley serves as the watershed of the sacramento river  while the southern portion  the san joaquin valley is the watershed for the san joaquin river  both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them  with dredging  the sacramento and the san joaquin rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be seaports   the sacramento-san joaquin river delta is a critical water supply hub for the state  water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of pumps and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state  to the central valley and the state water projects and other needs  water from the delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people  almost two-thirds of the state s population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the san joaquin valley   the channel islands are located off the southern coast   the sierra nevada  spanish for  snowy range   includes the highest peak in the contiguous 48 states  mount whitney  at 14,505 feet (4,421\xa0m   6][7][8  the range embraces yosemite valley  famous for its glacially carved domes  and sequoia national park  home to the giant sequoia trees  the largest living organisms on earth  and the deep freshwater lake  lake tahoe  the largest lake in the state by volume   to the east of the sierra nevada are owens valley and mono lake  an essential migratory bird habitat  in the western part of the state is clear lake  the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in california  though lake tahoe is larger  it is divided by the california nevada border  the sierra nevada falls to arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers  including palisade glacier  the southernmost glacier in the united states   about 45 percent of the state s total surface area is covered by forests  70  and california s diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state  california contains more forestland than any other state except alaska  many of the trees in the california white mountains are the oldest in the world  an individual bristlecone pine is over 5,000 years old  71][72   in the south is a large inland salt lake  the salton sea  the south-central desert is called the mojave  to the northeast of the mojave lies death valley  which contains the lowest and hottest place in north america  the badwater basin at \u2212279 feet (\u221285\xa0m   10  the horizontal distance from the bottom of death valley to the top of mount whitney is less than 90 miles (140\xa0km   indeed  almost all of southeastern california is arid  hot desert  with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer  the southeastern border of california with arizona is entirely formed by the colorado river  from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water   california contains both the highest point  mount whitney  and the lowest point  death valley  in the contiguous united states   a majority of california s cities are located in either the san francisco bay area or the sacramento metropolitan area in northern california  or the los angeles area  the riverside-san bernardino-inland empire  or the san diego metropolitan area in southern california  the los angeles area  the bay area  and the san diego metropolitan area are among several major metropolitan areas along the california coast   as part of the ring of fire  california is subject to tsunamis  floods  droughts  santa ana winds  wildfires  landslides on steep terrain  and has several volcanoes  it has many earthquakes due to several faults running through the state  in particular the san andreas fault  about 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year  but most are too small to be felt  73   although most of the state has a mediterranean climate  due to the state s large size  the climate ranges from subarctic to subtropical  the cool california current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast  farther inland  there are colder winters and hotter summers  the maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of los angeles and san francisco being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the united states and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the north american continent  even the san diego shoreline bordering mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous united states  just a few miles inland  summer temperature extremes are significantly higher  with downtown los angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast  the same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the bay area  where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas that are close to the ocean   northern parts of the state have more rain than the south  california s mountain ranges also influence the climate  some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes  northwestern california has a temperate climate  and the central valley has a mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast  the high mountains  including the sierra nevada  have an alpine climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer   california s mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side  creating extensive deserts  the higher elevation deserts of eastern california have hot summers and cold winters  while the low deserts east of the southern california mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters  death valley  a desert with large expanses below sea level  is considered the hottest location in the world  the highest temperature in the world  74][75  134\xa0\xb0f (56.7\xa0\xb0c   was recorded there on july 10  1913  the lowest temperature in california was

not  this includes the relatively cool summers of the humboldt bay region around eureka  the extreme heat of death valley  and the mountain climate of mammoth in the sierra nevadas   california is one of the richest and most diverse parts of the world  and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities  california is part of the nearctic ecozone and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions  77   california s large number of endemic species includes relict species  which have died out elsewhere  such as the catalina ironwood  lyonothamnus floribundus   many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation  whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the california lilac  ceanothus   many california endemics have become endangered  as urbanization  logging  overgrazing  and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat   california boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora  the largest trees  the tallest trees  and the oldest trees  california s native grasses are perennial plants  78  after european contact  these were generally replaced by invasive species of european annual grasses  and  in modern times  california s hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer  79   because california has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain  the state has six life zones which are the lower sonoran  desert   upper sonoran  foothill regions and some coastal lands   transition  coastal areas and moist northeastern
