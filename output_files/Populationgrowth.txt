Populationgrowth
 in biology  population growth is the increase in the number of individuals in a population   global human population growth amounts to around 75 million annually  or 1.1  per year  the global population has grown from 1 billion in 1800 to 7 billion in 2012  it is expected to keep growing  and estimates have put the total population at 8.4 billion by mid-2030  and 9.6 billion by mid-2050  many nations with rapid population growth have low standards of living  whereas many nations with low rates of population growth have high standards of living  1       the growth of the population started in the western world during industrialization by the end of the 18th century  the reasons for the  modern rise of population  3  were particularly investigated by the british health scientist thomas mckeown (1912-1988   in his publications  mckeown challenged four theories about the population growth   although the mckeown thesis has been heavily disputed  recent studies have confirmed the value of his ideas  his work is pivotal for present day thinking about population growth  birth control  public health and medical care  mckeown had a major influence on many population researchers  such as health economists and noble prize winners robert w  fogel (1993  and angus deaton (2015   the latter considered mckeown as  the founder of social medicine   8   the  population growth rate  is the rate at which the number of individuals in a population increases in a given time period  expressed as a fraction of the initial population  specifically  population growth rate refers to the change in population over a unit time period  often expressed as a percentage of the number of individuals in the population at the beginning of that period  this can be written as the formula  valid for a sufficiently small time interval   a positive growth rate indicates that the population is increasing  while a negative growth rate indicates that the population is decreasing  a growth ratio of zero indicates that there were the same number of individuals at the beginning and end of the period u2014a growth rate may be zero even when there are significant changes in the birth rates  death rates  immigration rates  and age distribution between the two times  9   a related measure is the net reproduction rate  in the absence of migration  a net reproduction rate of more than 1 indicates that the population of females is increasing  while a net reproduction rate less than one  sub-replacement fertility  indicates that the population of females is decreasing   most populations do not grow exponentially  rather they follow a logistic model  once the population has reached its carrying capacity  it will stabilize and the exponential curve will level off towards the carrying capacity  which is usually when a population has depleted most its natural resources  10   the logistic equation  \n n n n n n nd np n n nd nt n n n n  nk np n  n1\n u2212 n n np nk n n n  n n n   displaystyle    frac {dp  dt   kp 1-   frac  p  k     n n  where    n n n np n  nt n  n n n   displaystyle p t   n n  the population after time t   n n n nt n n n   displaystyle t  n n  time a population grows   n n n nk n n n   displaystyle k  n n  relative growth rate coefficient   n n n nk n n n   displaystyle k  n n  carrying capacity of the population  defined by ecologists as the maximum population size that a particular environment can sustain  10   the analytic logistic solution  this is a separable differential equation that can be derived through integration  the analytic solution is useful in analyzing the behavior of population models  11   the equation is separable and to find the solution we integrate   \n n n n u222b n n n nd np n n np n  n1\n u2212\n n np nk n n n  n n n n  n u222b nk n u22c5 nd nt n n n   displaystyle   int    frac {dp  p 1-   frac  p  k        int k  cdot dt  n n  working on just the left side of the equation  the fraction in the denominator is eliminated by multiplying the variable k  and then the fraction is split in 2   \n n n n n n1\n np n  n1\n u2212\n n np nk n n n  n n n n u22c5\n n nk nk n n n  n n nk n np n  nk n u2212 np n  n n n n n n   displaystyle    frac {1}{p 1-   frac  p  k       cdot    frac  k  k      frac  k  p k-p     n n  \n n n n n nk n np n  nk n u2212\np n  n n n n  n n n1\np n n n  n n n1\n nk n u2212 np n n n n n n   displaystyle    frac  k  p k-p       frac {1  p      frac {1  k-p    n n  the partial fraction is then integrated more easily   \n n n n u222b n  n n n1\np n n n  n n n1\n nk n u2212\np n n n n  nd np n  n u222b nk n u22c5 nd nt n n n   displaystyle   int     frac {1  p      frac {1  k-p   dp   int k  cdot dt  n n  after integrating and using u substitution  we get  \n n n n u2212\nln n u2061\n n  np n  n n  nln n u2061\n n  nk n u2212\np n  n n  n u2212\nk nt n u2212 nc n n n   displaystyle -
