year to sell cars made by singer from premises in callow street  london where they also serviced gwk and calthorpe vehicles  martin raced specials at aston hill near aston clinton  and the pair decided to make their own vehicles  11  the first car to be named aston martin was created by martin by fitting a four-cylinder coventry-simplex engine to the chassis of a 1908 isotta-fraschini  12][13   they acquired premises at henniker mews 14  in kensington and produced their first car in march 1915  production could not start because of the outbreak of world war i  and martin joined the

designed to carry the aston-martin name  bamford left in 1920 and the company was revitalised with funding from count louis zborowski  in 1922  bamford  amp  martin produced cars to compete in the

it aston martin motors and moved it to the former whitehead aircraft limited works in feltham  renwick and bertelli had been in partnership some years and had developed an overhead-cam four-cylinder engine using renwick s patented combustion chamber design  which they had tested in an enfield-allday chassis  the only  renwick and bertelli  motor car made  it was known as  buzzbox  and still survives   the pair had planned to sell their engine to motor manufacturers  but having heard that the aston martin was no longer in production realised they could capitalise on its reputation to jump start the production of a completely new car   between 1926 and 1937 bertelli was both technical director and designer of all new aston martins  since known as  bertelli cars   they included the 1 xbd-litre  t-type    international    le mans    mkii  and its racing derivative  the  ulster   and the 2-litre 15/98 and its racing derivative  the  speed model   most were open two-seater sports cars bodied by bert bertelli s brother enrico  harry   with a small number of long-chassis four-seater tourers  dropheads and saloons also produced   bertelli was a competent driver keen to race his cars  one of few owner manufacturer drivers  the  lm  team cars were very successful in national and international motor racing including at le mans and the mille miglia   financial problems reappeared in 1932  the company was rescued for a year by l  prideaux brune before passing it on to sir arthur sutherland  in 1936  aston martin decided to concentrate on road cars  producing just 700 until world war ii halted work  production shifted to aircraft components during the war   in 1947  tractor manufacturer david brown limited bought the company under the leadership of managing director sir david brown u2014its  post-war saviour   the company also acquired lagonda that year for its 2.6-litre w  o  bentley-designed engine  both companies shared resources and workshops  leading to the classic  db  series of cars  in 1950  the company announced the db2  followed by the db2/4 in 1953  the db2/4 mkii in 1955  the db mark iii in 1957 and the italian-styled 3.7\xa0l db4 in 1958   while these models helped aston martin establish a good racing pedigree  the db4 stood out and yielded the famous db5 in 1963  the company stayed true to its emerging  grand touring  style with the db6 (1965\u201370   and dbs (1967\u20131972    the six-cylinder engines of these cars from 1954 up to 1965 were designed by tadek marek   the aston martin company was often financially troubled  in 1972  the firm was sold to company developments  a birmingham-based consortium chaired by william wilson  mbe  15   the company was resold in 1975 by its receiver following a further bankruptcy to north american businessmen peter sprague and george minden for \xa31.05\xa0million  16  a successful turn-around strategy led to the recruitment of 360 new employees and  by 1977  a trading profit of \xa3750,000.[16  the new owners pushed the company into modernising its line  producing the v8 vantage in 1977  the convertible volante in 1978  and the one-off william towns-styled bulldog in 1980  towns also styled the futuristic new lagonda saloon  based on the v8 model   in 1980 aston-martin sought to buy mg  planning to design a new model and offering their take on an updated 1981 model mgb  the acquisition never developed  as the company was badly hit by the economic contraction of the early 1980s  worldwide sales shrank to three cars per week  prompting chairman alan curtis  sprague  and minden to consider shutting down production to concentrate on service and restoration  at this point curtis attended the 1980 pace sponsored stirling moss benefit day at brands hatch  and met fellow farnham resident victor gauntlett   gauntlett bought a 12.5  stake in aston martin for \xa3500,000 via pace petroleum in 1980  with tim hearley of ch industrials taking a similar share  pace and chi took over as joint 50/50 owners at the beginning of 1981  with gauntlett as executive chairman  gauntlett also led the sales team  and after some development and publicity when it became the world s fastest 4-seater production car  was able to sell the aston martin lagonda in oman  kuwait  and qatar  17   in 1982  aston martin was granted a royal warrant of appointment by the prince of wales  citation needed  the company holds the warrant to this day   understanding that it would take some time to develop new aston martin products  they created an engineering service subsidiary to develop automotive products for other companies  it was decided to use the name of the coachbuilding company tickford which aston martin had owned since 1955  the name being already associated with quality cars in the public perception  products included a tickford austin metro  a tickford ford capri and even tickford train interiors  particularly on the jaguar xjs  17  pace continued sponsoring racing events  and now sponsored all aston martin owners club events  taking a tickford-engined nimrod group c car owned by amoc president viscount downe  which came third in the manufacturers championship in both 1982 and 1983  it also finished seventh in the 1982 24 hours of le mans race  however  sales of production cars were now at an all-time low of 30 cars produced in 1982.[17   as trading became tighter in the petroleum market  and aston martin was requiring more time and money  gauntlett agreed to sell hays pace to the kuwait investment office in september 1983  as aston martin required greater investment  he also agreed to sell his share holding to american importer and greek shipping tycoon peter livanos  who invested via his joint venture company with nick and john papanicolaou  all inc  gauntlett remained chairman of the aml company 55  owned by all  with tickford a 50/50 venture between all and chi  the uneasy relationship was ended when all exercised options to buy a larger share in aml  chi s residual shares were exchanged for chi s complete ownership of tickford  which retained development of existing aston martin projects  in 1984  titan the main shipping company of the papanicolaou s was in trouble  so livanos s father george bought out the papanicolaou s shares in all  while gauntlett again became a shareholder with a 25  holding in aml  the deal valued aston martin aml at \xa32\xa0million  the year it built its 10,000th car  17   although as a result aston martin had to make 60 members of the workforce redundant  gauntlett bought a stake in italian styling house zagato  and resurrected its collaboration with aston martin   in 1986  gauntlett negotiated the return of fictional british secret agent james bond to aston martin  cubby broccoli had chosen to recast the character using actor timothy dalton  in an attempt to re-root the bond-brand back to a more sean connery-like feel  gauntlett supplied his personal pre-production vantage for use in the filming of the living daylights  and sold a volante to broccoli for use at his home in america  gauntlett turned down the role of a kgb colonel in the film  however   i would have loved to have done it but really could not afford the time   18   the company needed funds to survive in the long term  in may 1987  gauntlett and prince michael of kent were staying at the home of contessa maggi  the wife of the founder of the original mille miglia  while watching the revival event  another house guest was walter hayes  vice-president of ford of europe  despite problems over the previous acquisition of ac cars  hayes saw the potential of the brand and the discussion resulted in ford taking a share holding in september 1987.[19  in 1988  having produced some 5,000 cars in 20 years  a revived economy and successful sales of limited edition vantage  and 52 volante zagato coupes at \xa386,000 each  the company finally retired the ancient v8 and introduced the virage range u2014the first new aston launched in 20 years   although gauntlett was contractually to stay as chairman for two years  his racing interests took aston back into sports car racing in 1989 with limited european success  however  with engine rule changes for the 1990 season and the launch of the new aston martin volante model  ford provided the limited supply of cosworth engines to the jaguar cars racing team  as the  small aston  db7 would require a large engineering input  ford agreed to take full control of aston martin  and gauntlett handed over the company chairmanship to hayes in 1991.[20  in 1992  the vantage version was announced  and the following year the company renewed the db range by announcing the db7   ford placed aston in the premier
