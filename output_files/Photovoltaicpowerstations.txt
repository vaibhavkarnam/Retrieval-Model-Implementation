Photovoltaicpowerstations
 a photovoltaic power station  also known as a solar park  is a large-scale photovoltaic system  pv system  designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid  they are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level  rather than to a local user or users  they are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches  especially when sited in agricultural areas  the generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project   the solar power source is via photovoltaic modules that convert light directly to electricity  however  this differs from  and should not be confused with concentrated solar power  the other large-scale solar generation technology  which uses heat to drive a variety of conventional generator systems  both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages  but to date  for a variety of reasons  photovoltaic technology has seen much wider use in the field  as of 2013 update   pv systems outnumber concentrators by about 40 to 1   in some countries  the nameplate capacity of a photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak  mwp   which refers to the solar array s dc power output  however  canada  japan  spain and some parts of the united states often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in mwac  a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation  a third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes  mva   most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1\xa0mwp  as at the start of 2017  the world s largest operating photovoltaic power station has a capacity of over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned  as at the end of 2016  about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96\xa0gwac 1][2  were solar farms larger than 4\xa0mwac  3   most of the existing large-scale photovoltaic power stations are owned and operated by independent power producers  but the involvement of community- and utility-owned projects is increasing  to date  almost all have been supported at least in part by regulatory incentives such as feed-in tariffs or tax credits  but as levelized costs have fallen significantly in the last decade and grid parity has been reached in an increasing number of markets  it may not be long before external incentives cease to exist       the first 1 mwp solar park was built by arco solar at lugo near hesperia  california at the end of 1982,[4  followed in 1984 by a 5.2 mwp installation in carrizo plain  5  both have since been decommissioned  though carrizo plain is the site for several large plants now being constructed 6  or planned  the next stage followed the 2004 revisions 7  to the feed-in tariffs in germany 8  when a substantial volume of solar parks were constructed  8   several hundred installations over 1 mwp have been since been installed in germany  of which more than 50 are over 10 mwp  9  with its introduction of feed-in tariffs in 2008  spain became briefly the largest market  with some 60 solar parks over 10 mw  10  but these incentives have since been withdrawn  11  the usa  12  china 13  india  14  france  15  canada  16  and italy  17  amongst others  have also become major markets as shown on the list of photovoltaic power stations   the largest sites under construction have capacities of hundreds of mwp and projects at a scale of 1 gwp are being planned  6][18][19   the land area required for a desired power output  varies depending on the location  20  and on the efficiency of the solar modules  21  the slope of the site 22  and the type of mounting used  fixed tilt solar arrays using typical modules of about 15  efficiency 23  on horizontal sites  need about 1 hectare mw in the tropics and this figure rises to over 2 hectares in northern europe  20   because of the longer shadow the array casts when tilted at a steeper angle  24  this area is typically about 10  higher for an adjustable tilt array or a single axis tracker  and 20  higher for a 2-axis tracker  25  though these figures will vary depending on the latitude and topography  26   the best locations for solar parks in terms of land use are held to be brown field sites  or where there is no other valuable land use  27  even in cultivated areas  a significant proportion of the site of a solar farm can also be devoted to other productive uses  such as crop growing 28][29  or biodiversity  30   agrivoltaics is co-developing the same area of land for both solar photovoltaic power as well as for conventional agriculture  a recent study found that the value of solar generated electricity coupled to shade-tolerant crop production created an over 30  increase in economic value from farms deploying agrivoltaic systems instead of conventional agriculture  31   in some cases several different solar power stations  with separate owners and contractors  are developed on adjacent sites  32  this can offer the advantage of the projects sharing the cost and risks of project infrastructure such as grid connections and planning approval  33  solar farms can also be co-located with wind farms  34  sometimes the title  solar park  is used  rather than an individual solar power station  35][36   some examples of such solar clusters are the charanka solar park  where there are 17 different generation projects  neuhardenberg  37][38  with eleven plants  and the golmud solar parks with total reported capacity over 500mw  39][40  an extreme example is calling all of the solar farms in the gujarat state of india a single solar park  the gujarat solar park   most solar parks are ground mounted pv systems  also known as free-field solar power plants  41  they can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis solar tracker  42  while tracking improves the overall performance  it also increases the system s installation and maintenance cost  43][44  a solar inverter converts the array s power output from dc to ac  and connection to the utility grid is made through a high voltage  three phase step up transformer of typically 10\xa0kv and above  45][46   the solar arrays are the subsystems which convert incoming light into electrical energy  47  they comprise a multitude of solar modules  mounted on support structures and interconnected to deliver a power output to electronic power conditioning subsystems  48   a minority of utility-scale solar parks are configured on buildings 49  and so use building-mounted solar arrays  the majority are  free field  systems using ground-mounted structures  41  usually of one of the following types   many projects use mounting structures where the solar modules are mounted at a fixed inclination calculated to provide the optimum annual output profile  42  the modules are normally oriented towards the equator  at a tilt angle slightly less than the latitude of the site  50  in some cases  depending on local climatic  topographical or electricity pricing regimes  different tilt angles can be used  or the arrays might be offset from the normal east-west axis to favour morning or evening output  51   a variant on this design is the use of arrays  whose tilt angle can be adjusted twice or four times annually to optimise seasonal output  42  they also require more land area to reduce internal shading at the steeper winter tilt angle  24  because the increased output is typically only a few percent  it seldom justifies the increased cost and complexity of this design  25   to maximise the intensity of incoming direct radiation  solar panels should be orientated normal to the sun s rays  52  to achieve this  arrays can be designed using two-axis trackers  capable of tracking the sun in its daily orbit across the sky  and as its elevation changes throughout the year  53   these arrays need to be spaced out to reduce inter-shading as the sun moves and the array orientations change  so need more land area  54  they also require more complex mechanisms to maintain the array surface at the required angle  the increased output can be of the order of 30%[55  in locations with high levels of direct radiation  but the increase is lower in temperate climates or those with more significant diffuse radiation  due to overcast conditions  for this reason  dual axis trackers are most commonly used in subtropical regions  54  and were first deployed at utility scale at the lugo plant  4   a third approach achieves some of the output benefits of tracking  with a lesser penalty in terms of land area  capital and operating cost  this involves tracking the sun in one dimension \u2013 in its daily journey across the sky \u2013 but not adjusting for the seasons  56  the angle of the axis is normally horizontal  though some  such as the solar park at nellis airforce base  which have a 20\xb0 tilt  57  incline the axis towards the equator in a north-south orientation \u2013 effectively a hybrid between tracking and fixed tilt  58   single axis tracking systems are aligned along axes roughly north-south  59  some use linkages between rows so that the same actuator can adjust the angle of several rows at once  56   solar panels produce direct current  dc  electricity  so solar parks need conversion equipment 48  to convert this to alternating current  ac   which is the form transmitted by the electricity grid  this conversion is done by inverters  to maximise their efficiency  solar power plants also incorporate maximum power point trackers  either within the inverters or as separate units  these devices keep each solar array string close to its peak power point  60   there are two primary alternatives for configuring this conversion equipment  centralised and string inverters  61  although in some cases individual  or micro-inverters are used  62  single inverters allows optimizing the output of each panel  and multiple inverters increases the reliability by limiting the loss of output when an inverter fails  63   these units have relatively high capacity  typically of the order of 1 mw  65  so they condition that the output of a substantial block of solar arrays  up to perhaps 2 hectares (4.9 acres  in area  66  solar parks using centralised inverters are often configured in discrete rectangular blocks  with the related inverter in one corner  or the centre of the block  67][68][69   string inverters are substantially lower in capacity  of the order of 10\xa0kw  65][70  and condition the output of a single array string  this is normally a whole  or part of  a row of solar arrays within the overall plant  string inverters can enhance the efficiency of solar parks  where different parts of the array are experiencing different levels of insolation  for example where arranged at different orientations  or closely packed to minimise site area  63   the system inverters typically provide power output at voltages of the order of 480 vac  71][72  electricity grids operate at much higher voltages of the order of tens or hundreds of thousands of volts  73  so transformers are incorporated to deliver the required output to the grid  46  due to the long lead time  the long island solar farm chose to keep a spare transformer onsite  as transformer failure would have kept the solar farm offline for a long period  74  transformers typically have a life of 25 to 75 years  and normally do not require replacement during the life of a photovoltaic power station  75   the performance of a solar park is a function of the climatic conditions  the equipment used and the system configuration  the primary energy input is the global light irradiance in the plane of the solar arrays  and this in turn is a combination of the direct and the diffuse radiation  76   a key determinant of the output of the system is the conversion efficiency of the solar modules  which will depend in particular on the type of solar cell used  77   there will be losses between the dc output of the solar modules and the ac power delivered to the grid  due to a wide range of factors such as light absorption losses  mismatch  cable voltage drop  conversion efficiencies  and other parasitic losses  78  a parameter called the  performance ratio  79  has been developed to evaluate the total value of these losses  the performance ratio gives a measure of the output ac power delivered as a proportion of the total dc power which the solar modules should be able to deliver under the ambient climatic conditions  in modern solar parks the performance ratio should typically be in excess of 80%.[80][81   early photovoltaic systems output decreased as much as 10%/year  5  but as of 2010 the median degradation rate was 0.5  year  with modules made after 2000 having a significantly lower degradation rate  so that a system would lose only 12  of its output performance in 25 years  a system using modules which degrade 4  year will lose 64  of its output during the same period  82  many panel makers offer a performance guarantee  typically 90  in ten years and 80  over 25 years  the output of all panels is typically warranteed at plus or minus 3  during the first year of operation  83   solar power plants are developed to deliver merchant electricity into the grid as an alternative to other renewable  fossil or nuclear generating stations  86   the plant owner is an electricity generator  most solar power plants today are owned by independent power producers (ipp s   87  though some are held by investor- or community-owned utilities  88   some of these power producers develop their own portfolio of power plants  89  but most solar parks are initially designed and constructed by specialist project developers  90  typically the developer will plan the project  obtain planning and connection consents  and arrange financing for the capital required  91  the actual construction work is normally contracted to one or more epc  engineering  procurement and construction  contractors  92   major milestones in the development of a new photovoltaic power plant are planning consent  93  grid connection approval  94  financial close  95  construction  96  connection and commissioning  97  at each stage in the process  the developer will be able to update estimates of the anticipated performance and costs of the plant and the financial returns it should be able to deliver  98   photovoltaic power stations occupy at least one hectare for each megawatt of rated output  99  so require a substantial land area  which is subject to planning approval  the chances of obtaining consent  and the related time  cost and conditions  varying from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and location to location  many planning approvals will also apply conditions on the treatment of the site after the station has been decommissioned in the future  72  a professional health  safety and environment assessment is usually undertaken during the design of a pv power station in order to ensure the facility is designed and planned in accordance with all hse regulations   the availability  locality and capacity of the connection to the grid is a major consideration in planning a new solar park  and can be a significant contributor to the cost  100   most stations are sited within a few kilometres of a suitable grid connection point  this network needs to be capable of absorbing the output of the solar park when operating at its maximum capacity  the project developer will normally have to absorb the cost of providing power lines to this point and making the connection  in addition often to any costs associated with upgrading the grid  so it can accommodate the output from the plant  101   once the solar park has been commissioned  the owner usually enters into a contract with a suitable counterparty to undertake operation and maintenance (o amp m   102  in many cases this may be fulfilled by the original epc contractor  103   solar plants  reliable solid-state systems require minimal maintenance  compared to rotating machinery for example  104  a major aspect of the o amp m contract will be continuous monitoring of the performance of the plant and all of its primary subsystems  105  which is normally undertaken remotely  106  this enables performance to be compared with the anticipated output under the climatic conditions actually experienced  95  it also provides data to enable the scheduling of both rectification and preventive maintenance  107  a small number of large solar farms use a separate inverter 108][109  or maximizer 110  for each solar panel  which provide individual performance data that can be monitored  for other solar farms  thermal imaging is a tool that is used to identify non-performing panels for replacement  111   a solar park s income derives from the sales of electricity to the grid  and so its output is metered in real-time with readings of its energy output provided  typically on a half-hourly basis  for balancing and settlement within the electricity market  112   income is affected by the reliability of equipment within the plant and also by the availability of the grid network to which it is exporting  113  some connection contracts allow the transmission system operator to constrain the output of a solar park  for example at times of low demand or high availability of other generators  114  some countries make statutory provision for priority access to the grid 115  for renewable generators  such as that under the european renewable energy directive  116   in recent years  pv technology has improved its electricity generating efficiency  reduced the installation cost per watt as well as its energy payback time  epbt   and has reached grid parity in at least 19 different markets by 2014.[117][118  photovoltaics is increasingly becoming a viable source of mainstream power  119  however  prices for pv systems show strong regional variations  much more than solar cells and panels  which tend to be global commodities  in 2013  utility-scale system prices in highly penetrated markets such as china and germany were significantly lower ($1.40 w  than in the united states ($3.30 w   the iea explains these discrepancies due to differences in  soft costs   which include customer acquisition  permitting  inspection and interconnection  installation labor and financing costs  120]:14  solar generating stations have become progressively cheaper in recent years  and this trend is expected to continue  121  meanwhile  traditional electricity generation is becoming progressively more expensive  122  these trends are expected to lead to a crossover point when the levelised cost of energy from solar parks  historically more expensive  matches the cost of traditional electricity generation  123  this point is commonly referred to as grid parity  124   for merchant solar power stations  where the electricity is being sold into the electricity transmission network  the levelised cost of solar energy will need to match the wholesale electricity price  this point is sometimes called  wholesale grid parity  or  busbar parity   125   some photovoltaic systems  such as rooftop installations  can supply power directly to an electricity user  in these cases  the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price at which the user pays for his electricity consumption  this situation is sometimes called  retail grid parity    socket parity  or  dynamic grid parity   126  research carried out by un-energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices  such as italy  spain and australia  and areas using diesel generators  have reached retail grid parity  125   because the point of grid parity has not yet been reached in many parts of the world  solar generating stations need some form of financial incentive to compete for the supply of electricity  127  many legislatures around the world have introduced such incentives to support the deployment of solar power stations  128   feed in tariffs are designated prices which must be paid by utility companies for each kilowatt hour of renewable electricity produced by qualifying generators and fed into the grid  129  these tariffs normally represent a premium on wholesale electricity prices and offer a guaranteed revenue stream to help the power producer finance the project  130   these standards are obligations on utility companies to source a proportion of their electricity from renewable generators  131  in most cases  they do not prescribe which technology should be used and the utility is free to select the most appropriate renewable sources  132   there are some exceptions where solar technologies are allocated a proportion of the rps in what is sometimes referred to as a  solar set aside   133   some countries and states adopt less targeted financial incentives  available for a wide range of infrastructure investment  such as the us department of energy loan guarantee scheme  134  which stimulated a number of investments in the solar power plant in 2010 and 2011.[135   another form of indirect incentive which has been used to stimulate investment in solar power plant was tax credits available to investors  in some cases the credits were linked to the energy produced by the installations  such as the production tax credits  136  in other cases the credits were related to the capital investment such as the investment tax credits 137   in addition to free market commercial incentives  some countries and regions have specific programs to support the deployment of solar energy installations   the european union s renewables directive 138  sets targets for increasing levels of deployment of renewable energy in all member states  each has been required to develop a national renewable energy action plan showing how these targets would be met  and many of these have specific support measures for solar energy deployment  139  the directive also allows states to develop projects outside their national boundaries  and this may lead to bilateral programs such as the helios project  140   the clean development mechanism 141  of the unfccc is an international programme under which solar generating stations in certain qualifying countries can be supported  142   additionally many other countries have specific solar energy development programmes  some examples are india s jnnsm  143  the flagship program in australia  144  and similar projects in south africa 145  and israel  146   the financial performance of the solar power plant is a function of its income and its costs  25   the electrical output of a solar park will be related to the solar radiation  the capacity of the plant and its performance ratio  79  the income derived from this electrical output will come primarily from the sale of the electricity  147  and any incentive payments such as those under feed-in tariffs or other support mechanisms  148   electricity prices may vary at different times of day  giving a higher price at times of high demand  149  this may influence the design of the plant to increase its output at such times  150   the dominant costs of solar power plants are the capital cost  and therefore any associated financing and depreciation  151  though operating costs are typically relatively low  especially as no fuel is required  104  most operators will want to ensure that adequate operation and maintenance cover 105  is available to maximise the availability of the plant and thereby optimise the income to cost ratio  152   the first places to reach grid parity were those with high traditional electricity prices and high levels of solar radiation  20  currently  more capacity is being installed in the rooftop than in the utility-scale segment  however  the worldwide distribution of solar parks is expected to change as different regions achieve grid parity  153  this transition also includes a shift from rooftop towards utility-scale plants  since the focus of new pv deployment has changed from europe towards the sunbelt markets where ground-mounted pv systems are favored  154]:43  because of the economic background  large-scale systems are presently distributed where the support regimes have been the most consistent  or the most advantageous  155  total capacity of worldwide pv plants above 4 mwac was assessed by wiki-solar as 36 gw in c  2,300 installations at the end of 2014[156  and represents about 25 percent of total global pv capacity of 139\xa0gw  154]:17 the countries which had the most capacity  in descending order  were the united states  china  germany  india  united kingdom  spain  italy  canada and south africa  157  activities in the key markets are reviewed individually below   china was reported in early 2013 to have overtaken germany as the nation with the most utility-scale solar capacity  158  much of this has been supported by the clean development mechanism  159  the distribution of power plants around the country is quite broad  with the highest concentration in the gobi desert 13  and connected to the northwest china power grid  160   the first multi-megawatt plant in europe was the 4.2 mw community-owned project at hemau  commissioned in 2003.[161  but it was the revisions to the german feed-in tariffs in 2004,[7  which gave the strongest impetus to the establishment of utility-scale solar power plants  162  the first to be completed under this programme was the leipziger land solar park developed by geosol  163  several dozen plants were built between 2004 and 2011  several of which were at the time the largest in the world  the eeg  the law which establishes germany u2019s feed-in tariffs  provides the legislative basis not just for the compensation levels  but other regulatory factors  such as priority access to the grid  115  the law was amended in 2010 to restrict the use of agricultural land  164  since which time most solar parks have been built on so-called \u2018development land u2019  such as former military sites  37  partly for this reason  the geographic distribution of photovoltaic power plants in germany 9  is biased towards the former eastern germany  165][166  as of february 2012  germany had 1.1 million photovoltaic power plants  most are small kw roof mounted   167   india has been rising up the leading nations for the installation of utility-scale solar capacity  158  the charanka solar park in gujarat was opened officially in april 2012[168  and was at the time the largest group of solar power plants in the world  geographically the majority of the stations are located in gujarat and maharashtra  14  rajasthan has successfully been attempting to attract solar development  169  rajasthan and gujarat share the thar desert  along with pakistan   italy has a very large number of photovoltaic power plants  the largest of which is the 84 mw montalto di castro project  170   the majority of the deployment of solar power stations in spain to date occurred during the boom market of 2007-8.[171  the stations are well distributed around the country  with some concentration in extremadura  castile-la mancha and murcia  10   the introduction of feed-in tariffs in the united kingdom in 2010 stimulated the first wave of utility-scale projects  172  with c  20 plants being completed 173  before tariffs were reduced on 1 august 2011 following the  fast track review   174  a second wave of installations was undertaken under the uk s renewables obligation  with the total number of plants connected by the end of march 2013 reaching 86.[175  this is reported to have made the uk europe s best market in the first quarter of 2013.[176   uk projects were originally concentrated in the south west  but have more recently spread across the south of england and into east anglia and the midlands  177  the first solar park in wales came on stream in 2011 at rhosygilwen  north pembrokeshire  178  as of june 2014 there were 18 schemes generating more than 5\xa0mw and 34 in planning or construction in wales  179   the us deployment of photovoltaic power stations is largely concentrated in southwestern states  12  the renewable portfolio standards in california 180  and surrounding states 181][182  provide a particular incentive  the volume of projects under construction in early 2013 has led to the forecast that the us will become the leading market  158   the following solar parks were  at the time they became operational  the largest in the world or their continent  or are notable for the reasons given   solar power plants under development are not included here  but may be on this list
