filipino  republika ng pilipinas   is a sovereign island country in southeast asia situated in the western pacific ocean  it consists of about 7,641 islands 17  that are categorized broadly under three main geographical divisions from north to south  luzon  visayas  and mindanao  the capital city of the philippines is manila and the most populous city is quezon city  both part of metro manila

west  palau to the east and malaysia and indonesia to the south   the philippines  location on the pacific ring of fire and close to the equator makes the philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons  but also endows it with abundant natural resources and some of the world s greatest biodiversity  the philippines has an area of 300,000 square kilometers (115,831\xa0sq xa0mi   19  and a population of approximately 100 million  20][21  it is the eighth-most populated country in asia and the 12th most populated country in the world  as of 2013 update   approximately 10 million additional filipinos lived overseas  22  comprising one of the world s largest diasporas  multiple ethnicities and cultures are found throughout the islands  in prehistoric times  negritos were some of the archipelago s earliest inhabitants  they were followed by successive waves of austronesian peoples  23  exchanges with chinese  malay  indian  and islamic states occurred  then  various competing maritime states were established under the rule of datus  rajahs  sultans or lakans   the arrival of ferdinand magellan in homonhon  eastern samar in 1521 marked the beginning of hispanic colonization  in 1543  spanish explorer ruy l xf3pez de villalobos named the archipelago las islas filipinas in honor of philip ii of spain  with the arrival of miguel l xf3pez de legazpi from mexico city  in 1565  the first hispanic settlement in the archipelago was established  24  the philippines became part of the spanish empire for more than 300 years  this resulted in roman catholicism becoming the dominant religion  during this time  manila became the western hub of the trans-pacific trade connecting asia with acapulco in the americas using manila galleons  25   as the 19th xa0century gave way to the 20th  there followed in quick succession the philippine revolution  which spawned the short-lived first philippine republic  followed by the bloody philippine u2013american war of conquest by us military force  26  aside from the period of japanese occupation  the united states retained sovereignty over the islands until after world war ii  when the philippines was recognized as an independent nation  since then  the philippines has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy  which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by a non-violent revolution  27   it is a founding member of the united nations  world trade organization  association of southeast asian nations  the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum  and the east asia summit  it also hosts the headquarters of the asian development bank  28  the philippines is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country  29  which has an economy transitioning from being one based on agriculture to one based more on services and manufacturing  30       the philippines was named in honor of king philip xa0ii of spain  spanish explorer ruy l xf3pez de villalobos  during his expedition in 1542  named the islands of leyte and samar felipinas after the then-prince of asturias  eventually the name las islas filipinas would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago  before that became commonplace  other names such as islas del poniente  islands of the west  and magellan s name for the islands san l xe1zaro were also used by the spanish to refer to the islands  31][32][33][34][35   the official name of the philippines has changed several times in the course of its history  during the philippine revolution  the malolos congress proclaimed the establishment of the rep xfablica filipina or the philippine republic  from the period of the spanish u2013american war (1898  and the philippine u2013american war (1899\u20131902  until the commonwealth period (1935\u201346   american colonial authorities referred to the country as the philippine islands  a translation of the spanish name  26  from the 1898 treaty of paris  the name philippines began to appear and it has since become the country s common name  since the end of world war ii  the official name of the country has been the republic of the philippines  36   the metatarsal of the callao man  reliably dated by uranium-series dating to 67,000 years ago is the oldest human remnant found in the archipelago to date  37  this distinction previously belonged to the tabon man of palawan  carbon-dated to around 26,500 years ago  38][39  negritos were also among the archipelago s earliest inhabitants  but their first settlement in the philippines has not been reliably dated  40   there are several opposing theories regarding the origins of ancient filipinos  f  landa jocano theorizes that the ancestors of the filipinos evolved locally  wilhelm solheim s island origin theory 41  postulates that the peopling of the archipelago transpired via trade networks originating in the sundaland area around 48,000 to 5000\xa0bc rather than by wide-scale migration  the austronesian expansion theory explains that malayo-polynesians coming from taiwan began migrating to the philippines around 4000\xa0bc  displacing earlier arrivals  42   the most widely accepted theory  based on linguistic and archeological evidence  is the  out-of-taiwan  model  which hypothesizes that austronesians from taiwan  who were themselves descended from the neolithic civilizations of the yangtze river such as the liangzhu culture  43  began migrating to the philippines around 4000\xa0bc  displacing earlier arrivals  42][44  during the neolithic period  a  jade culture  is said to have existed as evidenced by tens of thousands of exquisitely crafted jade artifacts found in the philippines dated to 2000\xa0bc  45][46   the jade is said to have originated nearby in taiwan and is also found in many other areas in insular and mainland southeast asia  these artifacts are said to be evidence of long range communication between prehistoric southeast asian societies  47  by 1000\xa0bc the inhabitants of the archipelago had developed into four kinds of social groups  hunter-gatherer tribes  warrior societies  highland plutocracies  and port principalities  48   some of the societies scattered in the islands of what would later become the philippines remained isolated but many evolved into states that developed substantial trade and contacts with the peoples of eastern  southern and southeastern asia  including those from brunei  china  india  indonesia  malaysia and japan as well as other austronesian islands  49][50   the first millennium saw the rise of the port principalities and their growth into maritime states composed of autonomous barangays independent of or allied with larger nations which were either malay kedatuans led by datus  tributary states to china ruled by wangs or indianized kingdoms governed by rajahs  51   the kedatuan of madja-as was founded following a civil war in collapsing srivijaya  wherein loyalists of the malay datus of srivijaya defied the invading chola dynasty and its puppet-rajah  called makatunao  and set up a guerrilla-state in the islands of the visayas  its founding datu  puti  had purchased land for his new realms from the aboriginal ati hero  marikudo  52   madja-as was founded on panay island  named after the destroyed state of pannai allied under srivijaya which was located in sumatra   afterwards  the people of madja-as often raided the port cities of southern china and warred with the chinese navy  53   the rajahnate of cebu 54  was a neighbor of madja-as in the visayas led by rajamuda sri lumay  a monarch with partial tamil descent  this state grew wealthy by making use of the inter-island shipping routes within the archipelago  55   meanwhile  the rajahnate of butuan in northeastern mindanao attained prominence under the rule of rajah sri bata shaja  50  who was from a buddhist ruling-class governing a hindu nation  this state became powerful due to the local goldsmith industry and also maintained commercial ties and a diplomatic rivalry with the champa civilization  both the rajahnates of butuan and cebu maintained contact and traded with kutai  a hindu country 56  in south borneo established by indian traders  57   the nation of ma-i centered in mindoro  was noted for its trust-worthiness in trade  58  in northern luzon  the wangdom of pangasinan under wang taymey  exported horses and silver to china  the kingdom of ryukyu and japan  59][60   in luzon  the kingdom of tondo was ruled over by the lakandula dynasty and the kingdom grew wealthy via the exclusive trading-rights of chinese goods which they marketed in southeast asia  this was granted to them by the ming dynasty  61][62  the yongle emperor also instituted a chinese governor on luzon during zheng he s voyages and appointed ko ch a-lao to that position  63][64   the 1300s saw the arrival and eventual spread of islam in the philippine archipelago  in 1380  karim ul  makdum and shari ful hashem syed abu bakr  an arab trader born in johore  arrived in sulu from malacca and established the sultanate of sulu by converting sulu s rajah  rajah baguinda ali and marrying his daughter  65][66  at the end of the 15th century  shariff mohammed kabungsuwan of johor introduced islam in the island of mindanao and established the sultanate of maguindanao  the sultanate form of government extended further into lanao  67   around this time  the people of luzon were collectively called lucoes and they rose to prominence by participating in trading ventures and military campaigns in myanmar  malacca and east timor 68][69][70  where they were employed as traders and mercenaries  71][72][73   islam then started to spread out of mindanao in the south and went into luzon in the north  manila in luzon was islamized during the reign of sultan bolkiah in 1485 to 1521  this was accomplished because the bruneian empire subjugated the kingdom of tondo by defeating rajah gambang and thereafter installing the muslim rajah  rajah sulaiman i to the throne and by establishing the bruneian puppet-state of the kingdom of maynila  74][75][76][77  sultan bolkiah also married laila mecana  the daughter of sulu sultan amir ul-ombra to expand brunei s influence in both luzon and mindanao  78  the muslims then proceeded to wage wars and conduct slave-raids against the visayans  79  participating in the muslim raids  the sultanate of ternate consequently destroyed the kedatuan of dapitan in bohol  80   nevertheless  states like the animist igorot  malay madja-as  sinified pangasinan  and indianized butuan still maintained their cultures  the rivalries between the datus  rajahs  wangs  sultans  and lakans eventually eased spanish colonization  furthermore  the islands were sparsely populated 81  due to consistent natural disasters 82  and inter-kingdom conflicts  therefore  colonization was made easy and the small states of the archipelago quickly became incorporated into the spanish empire and were hispanicized and christianized  83   in 1521  portuguese explorer ferdinand magellan s expedition arrived in the philippines  claimed the islands for spain and was then killed at the battle of mactan  84  colonization began when spanish explorer miguel l xf3pez de legazpi arrived from mexico in 1565 and formed the first hispanic settlements in cebu  after relocating to panay island and consolidating a coalition of native visayan allies  hispanic soldiers and latin-american mercenaries  the spaniards then invaded islamic manila  therein they put down the tondo conspiracy and exiled the conspirators to guam and guerrero  85  under spanish rule  they established manila as the capital of the spanish east indies (1571).[86   they also defeated the chinese-warlord limahong  87][88  in response to the islamic invasion of the philippines  the spanish then conducted the castilian war which was aimed against the sultanate of brunei 89][90  and war was also waged against the sultanate of ternate and tidore  in response to ternatean slaving and piracy against bohol and butuan   91  fortifications were also set up in taiwan and the maluku islands  these were abandoned and the spanish soldiers  along with the newly christianized papuan natives of the moluccas  withdrew back to the philippines in order to re-concentrate their military forces because of a threatened invasion by the japan-born ming-dynasty loyalist  koxinga  ruler of the kingdom of tungning  92  however  the planned invasion was aborted  meanwhile  settlers were sent to the pacific islands of palau and the marianas  93   spanish rule eventually contributed significantly to bringing political unity to the fragmented states of the archipelago  from 1565 to 1821  the philippines was governed as a territory of the mexico-based viceroyalty of new spain and then was administered directly from madrid after the mexican war of independence  the manila galleons  the largest wooden ships ever built  were constructed in bicol and cavite  94  the manila galleons were accompanied with a large naval escort as it traveled to and from manila and acapulco  95  the galleons sailed once or twice a year  between the 16th and 19th centuries  96   trade introduced foodstuff such as maize  tomatoes  potatoes  chili peppers  chocolate and pineapples from mexico and peru  within the philippines  the marquisate of buglas was established and rule of it was awarded to sebastian elcano and his crew  the survivors of the first circumnavigation of the world  as well as his descendants  new towns were also created 88  and roman catholic missionaries converted most of the lowland inhabitants to christianity  97  they also founded schools  a university  hospitals and churches which were built along the earthquake baroque architectural style  98  the spanish also decreed the introduction of free public schooling in 1863.[99  as a result of these policies the philippine population increased exponentially  100][101   during its rule  the spanish quelled various indigenous revolts  there were several external military challenges from chinese and japanese pirates  the dutch  the english  the portuguese and the muslims of southeast asia  those challengers were fought-off despite the hostile forces having encircled the philippine archipelago in a crescent formed from japan to indonesia  british forces occupied manila from 1762 to 1764 in an extension of the fighting of the seven years  war  spanish rule was restored following the 1763 treaty of paris  83][102][103  the spanish u2013moro conflict lasted for several hundred years  in the last quarter of the 19th century  spain conquered portions of mindanao and the moro muslims in the sulu sultanate formally recognized spanish sovereignty   in the 19th century  philippine ports opened to world trade and shifts started occurring within philippine society  many spaniards born in the philippines (criollos  104  and those of mixed ancestry  mestizos  became wealthy and an influx of latin american settlers 105][106  opened up government positions traditionally held by spaniards born in the iberian peninsula  peninsulares   the ideals of revolution also began to spread through the islands  criollo dissatisfaction resulted in the 1872 cavite mutiny that was a precursor to the philippine revolution  83][107][108][109   revolutionary sentiments were stoked in 1872 after three priests u2014mariano g xf3mez  jos xe9 burgos  and jacinto zamora  collectively known as gomburza  u2014were accused of sedition by colonial authorities and executed  107][108  this would inspire a propaganda movement in spain  organized by marcelo h  del pilar  jos xe9 rizal  and mariano ponce  lobbying for political reforms in the philippines  rizal was eventually executed on december 30  1896  on charges of rebellion  110  as attempts at reform met with resistance  andr xe9s bonifacio in 1892 established the secret society called the katipunan  who sought independence from spain through armed revolt  109   bonifacio and the katipunan started the philippine revolution in 1896  a faction of the katipunan  the magdalo of cavite province  eventually came to challenge bonifacio s position as the leader of the revolution and emilio aguinaldo took over  in 1898  the spanish u2013american war began in cuba and reached the philippines  aguinaldo declared philippine independence from spain in kawit  cavite on june 12  1898  and the first philippine republic was established in the barasoain church in the following year  83   the islands were ceded by spain to the united states as a result of the latter s victory in the spanish u2013american war  111  a compensation of us 20\xa0million was paid to spain according to the terms of the 1898 treaty of paris  112  as it became increasingly clear the united states would not recognize the nascent first philippine republic  the philippine u2013american war broke out  the first republic was defeated  and the archipelago was administered under an insular government  113  the war resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of combatants as well as a couple of hundred thousand civilians  mostly from a cholera epidemic  113][114][115][116   the americans then suppressed other rebellious sub-states  mainly  the waning sultanate of sulu  as well as the insurgent tagalog republic  the cantonal republic of negros in the visayas  and the republic of zamboanga in mindanao  117][118  during this era  a renaissance in philippine culture occurred  with the expansion of philippine cinema and literature  119][120][121  daniel burnham built an architectural plan for manila which would have transformed it into a modern city  122  in 1935  the philippines was granted commonwealth status with manuel quezon as president  he designated a national language and introduced women s suffrage and land reform  123][124  plans for independence over the next decade were interrupted by world war ii when the japanese empire invaded and the second philippine republic of jos xe9 p  laurel was established as a collaborator state   many atrocities and war crimes were committed during the war such as the bataan death march and the manila massacre that culminated during the battle of manila  125  in 1944  quezon died in exile in the united states and sergio osme xf1a succeeded him  the allied forces then employed a strategy of island hopping towards the philippine archipelago  in the process  retaking territory conquered by imperial japan   from mid-1942 through mid-1944  the filipino guerrilla resistance 126][127  had been supplied and encouraged by u s  navy submarines and a few parachute drops  so that the guerrillas could harass the japanese army and take control of the rural areas  jungles and mountains \u2013 thus  the japanese empire only controlled 12 out of 48 provinces  128  while remaining loyal to the united states  many filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence   eventually  the largest naval battle in history  according to gross tonnage sunk  the battle of leyte gulf  occurred when allied forces started the liberation of the philippines from the japanese empire  129][130  allied troops defeated the japanese in 1945  by the end of the war it is estimated that over a

the philippines exhibits aspects found in other asian countries with a malay 454  heritage  yet its culture also displays a significant number of spanish and american influences   traditional festivities known as barrio fiestas  district festivals  to commemorate the feast days of patron saints are common  these community celebrations are times for feasting  music  and dancing and the moriones and sinulog festivals are a couple of the most well-known   some traditions  however  are changing or gradually being forgotten due to modernization  the bayanihan philippine national folk dance company has been lauded for preserving many of the various traditional folk dances found throughout the philippines  they are famed for their iconic performances of philippine dances such as the tinikling and singkil that both feature clashing bamboo poles  455   one of the most visible hispanic legacies is the prevalence of spanish names and surnames among filipinos  a spanish name and surname  however  does not necessarily denote spanish ancestry  this peculiarity  unique among the people of asia  came as a result of a colonial edict by governor-general narciso claver xeda y zaldua  which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of hispanic nomenclature on the population  456  the names of many streets  towns  and provinces are also in spanish  spanish architecture has left an imprint in the philippines in the way many towns were designed around a central square or plaza mayor  but many of the buildings bearing its influence were demolished during world war ii  61  some examples remain  mainly among the country s churches  government buildings  and universities  four philippine baroque churches are included in the list of unesco world

the american occupation in the country can still be seen  commercial buildings  houses and churches in that era are abundant in the city and especially in calle real  459   however  certain areas of the country like batanes have slight differences as both spanish and filipino ways of life assimilated differently due to the climate there and limestone and coral were used as building materials  460  idjangs or ivatan castles were the primary shelter of the people prior to the spanish conquest of the whole philippines  461   the common use of the english language is an example of the american impact on philippine society  it has contributed to the ready acceptance and influence of american pop cultural trends  this affinity is seen in filipinos  love of fast food and american film and music  fast food outlets are found on many street corners  american global fast food chain stalwarts have entered the market  but local fast food chains like goldilocks and most notably jollibee  the leading fast food chain in the country  have emerged and compete successfully against their foreign rivals  462][463   philippine music has evolved rapidly due to the different influences stemming from colonialism under other countries  before the spanish conquest of the islands  most music was reminiscent of  or heavily influenced by  nature  some examples of this tribal music is koyu no tebulul of the t boli and ambo hato of the ifugao  this genre is often accompanied by gong music and one well known instrument is the kulintang   during the spanish era rondalya music  where traditional string orchestra mandolin type instruments were used  was widespread  in the philippines  rondalya refers to any group of stringed instruments that are played using a plectrum or pick  filipino instruments are made from indigenous philippine wood  plectrums  or picks  are made from tortoise-shell  other stringed instruments composing the standard filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the philippines  the la xfad  the octavina  the twelve-string guitar  the ukulele  the bajo de u xf1as or double bass  the guitarr xf3n mexicano  and other filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar  harana and kundiman are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals  464   marcelo adonay  organist   simplicio solis  organist   diego c  perez  pianist   jose conseco  pianist  and do xf1a dolores paterno  composer  were some of the recognized musicians in this era  nowadays  american pop culture has a heavy hold on the filipinos that evolved from the spanish times when the american occupation happened  along with korean pop  these two are dominating the recent music scene in media  465][466  however  the revival of spanish-influence folk music has been done due to the different choir groups in and out of the country like the philippine madrigal singers  467   pottery and weaving are among the very first art forms showcasing filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country  among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c  5\xa0bc to 225\xa0ad  weaving was mostly done by women  using fibers from abaca  pineapple  cotton  and bark to make clothes  rugs and hats  baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods  468][469   early philippine sculpture is characterized by frontal nudity  one of the earliest forms are the bulols by the ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests  the original function of these sculptures are related to the ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them  arab and russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of okkil  the beginnings of this sculpture type started with the islamization of sulu  the spanish colonization of the country did not hinder filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration  during this time  sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach filipinos christian doctrines  during the american colonialism  worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches   filipinos  first exposure to painting happened when spain conquered the philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches  however  as education progressed and wealth increased  more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery  470   paintings of early modernist painters such as dami xe1n domingo often still had a religious association but the art of juan luna and f xe9lix hidalgo showed a trend towards political statement  the first philippine national artist fernando amorsolo used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated aspects of philippine culture  while other artists such as fernando z xf3bel used both realistic and abstract techniques   in the modern period  the integration of architecture in the art deco style happened  many of these examples can be seen in statues all over the country especially in public parks and spaces  471   as a general description  the distinct value system of filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems  especially those based in kinship  obligation  friendship  religion  particularly christianity   and commercial relationships  472   filipino values are  for the most part  centered around maintaining social harmony  motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group  473  the main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of  hiya   roughly translated as  a sense of shame   and  amor propio  or 'self-esteem   473  social approval  acceptance by a group  and belonging to a group are major concerns  caring about what others will think  say or do  are strong influences on social behavior among filipinos  474   other elements of the filipino value system are optimism about the future  pessimism about present situations and events  concern and care for other people  the existence of friendship and friendliness  the habit of being hospitable  religious nature  respectfulness to self and others  respect for the female members of society  the fear of god  and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery  475   internationally  the philippines has been well documented for its successes in beauty pageants  while in most of the world the popularity of formal female beauty contests has diminished  they remain both popular and widespread in the philippines  the country s recent surge in the miss universe pageant alone in the 2010s marked the revived interest of not only the philippines but also throughout the rest of asia up against their rivals in latin america in international beauty pageantry  binibining pilipinas is a closely followed event throughout the country along with other major national pageants such as miss philippines earth and miss world philippines  the philippines have garnered one miss world  three miss universe  six miss international and three miss earth crowns  making it the world s third country  after brazil and venezuela  as well as asia s first country  to win all four major international beauty pageant titles  476   just like the evolution of philippine music  dance as well has been in constant change  prior to colonial rule  the philippines has a wide array of ethnic dances from different tribal groups  this is due mainly to the fact that philippines is an island thus the different varieties of dance developed  both luzon and visayas  at first  were more akin to tribal movements until the spanish came  mindanao represents more of an array of muslim inspired dances and spanish influence was minimal in the region of zamboanga   universal dances in the philippines are found at societal functions such as rituals  mimicry  life cycle and parties  during the spanish era  most dances are accompanied by rondalya music usually with 14-string bandurrias that the filipinos invented or by other type of stringed instruments that locally evolved in to the culture as well   one famous dance that is well known is called the tinikling  where a band of rondalya musicians play along with the percussive beat of the two bamboo poles  it usually starts with men and women acting a scene about  how rural townsfolk mingle   the dancers then graze thru the clashing of the bamboo poles held on opposite sides  the end displays the paired bamboo poles crossing each other  the muslim version of this where bamboo poles are also used is called the singkil  477  nowadays  in the modern and post-modern time periods  dances vary from the delicate ballet up to the more street-oriented styles of breakdancing to name a few  478   philippine cuisine has evolved over several centuries from its malayo-polynesian origins to become a mixed cuisine with many hispanic  chinese  american  and other asian influences that have been adapted to local ingredients and the filipino palate to create distinctively filipino dishes  dishes range from the very simple  like a meal of fried salted fish and rice  to the elaborate  such as the paellas and cocidos created for fiestas  463][479   popular dishes include lech xf3n  adobo  sinigang  kare-kare  tapa  crispy pata  pancit  lumpia  and halo-halo  some common local ingredients used in cooking are calamondins  coconuts  saba  a kind of short wide plantain   mangoes  milkfish  and fish sauce  filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors  but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors  463][479   unlike many of their asian counterparts  filipinos do not eat with chopsticks  they use western cutlery  however  possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in philippine cuisine  the main pairing of utensils seen at the filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork  not knife and fork  480   the traditional way of eating with the hands known as kamayan  using the washed right hand for bringing food to the mouth 481   was previously more often seen in the less urbanized areas  482  however  due to the various filipino restaurants that introduced filipino food to people of other nationalities as well as to filipino urbanites  kamayan fast became popular  this recent trend also sometimes incorporates the  boodle fight  concept  as popularized and coined by the philippine army   wherein banana leaves are used as giant plates on top of which rice portions and filipino viands are placed all together for a filial  friendly and or communal kamayan feasting  483   philippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional oral folk literature of the filipino people  while each unique ethnic group has its own stories and myths to tell  hindu and spanish influences can nonetheless be detected in many cases  philippine mythology mostly consists of creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures  such as the aswang  the manananggal  the diwata engkanto  and nature  some popular figures from philippine mythologies are maria makiling  lam-ang  and the sarimanok  484   philippine literature comprises works usually written in filipino  spanish  or english  some of the
