Internationalstandard
 international standards are standards developed by international standards organizations  international standards are available for consideration and use worldwide  the most prominent organization is the international organization for standardization  iso        international standards may be used either by direct application or by a process of modifying an international standard to suit local conditions  the adoption of international standards results in the creation of equivalent  national standards that are substantially the same as international standards in technical content  but may have  i  editorial differences as to appearance  use of symbols and measurement units  substitution of a point for a comma as the decimal marker  and  ii  differences resulting from conflicts in governmental regulations or industry-specific requirements caused by fundamental climatic  geographical  technological  or infrastructural factors  or the stringency of safety requirements that a given standard authority considers appropriate   international standards are one way of overcoming technical barriers in international commerce caused by differences among technical regulations and standards developed independently and separately by each nation  national standards organization  or company  technical barriers arise when different groups come together  each with a large user base  doing some well established thing that between them is mutually incompatible  establishing international standards is one way of preventing or overcoming this problem   the implementation of standards in industry and commerce became highly important with the onset of the industrial revolution and the need for high-precision machine tools and interchangeable parts  henry maudslay developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800  which allowed for the standardisation of screw thread sizes for the first time  1   maudslay s work  as well as the contributions of other engineers  accomplished a modest amount of industry standardization  some companies  in-house standards spread a bit within their industries  joseph whitworth s screw thread measurements were adopted as the first  unofficial  national standard by companies around the country in 1841  it came to be known as the british standard whitworth  and was widely adopted in other countries  2   by the end of the 19th century differences in standards between companies were making trade increasingly difficult and strained  the engineering standards committee was established in london in 1901 as the world s first national standards body  3][4  after the first world war  similar national bodies were established in other countries  the deutsches institut f xfcr normung was set up in germany in 1917  followed by its counterparts  the american national standard institute and the french commission permanente de standardisation  both in 1918.[1   by the mid to late 19th century  efforts were being made to standardize electrical measurement  an important figure was r  e  b  crompton  who became concerned by the large range of different standards and systems used by electrical engineering companies and scientists in the early 20th century  many companies had entered the market in the 1890s and all chose their own settings for voltage  frequency  current and even the symbols used on circuit diagrams  adjacent buildings would have totally incompatible electrical systems simply because they had been fitted out by different companies  crompton could see the lack of efficiency in this system and began to consider proposals for an international standard for electric engineering  5   in 1904  crompton represented britain at the louisiana purchase exposition in saint louis as part of a delegation by the institute of electrical engineers  he presented a paper on standardisation  which was so well received that he was asked to look into the formation of a commission to oversee the process  6  by 1906 his work was complete and he drew up a permanent constitution for the first international standards organization  the international electrotechnical commission  7  the body held its first meeting that year in london  with representatives from 14 countries  in honour of his contribution to electrical standardisation  lord kelvin was elected as the body s first president  8   the international federation of the national standardizing associations  isa  was founded in 1926 with a broader remit to enhance international cooperation for all technical standards and specifications  the body was suspended in 1942 during world war xa0ii   after the war  isa was approached by the recently formed united nations standards coordinating committee  unscc  with a proposal to form a new global standards body  in october 1946  isa and unscc delegates from 25 countries met in london and agreed to join forces to create the new international organization for standardization  iso   the new organization officially began operations in february xa01947.[9   [1
