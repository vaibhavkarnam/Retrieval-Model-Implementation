Stressmedicine
 physiological or biological stress is an organism s response to a stressor such as an environmental condition  stress is the body s method of reacting to a challenge  stimuli that alter an organism s environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body  the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  hpa  axis are two major systems that respond to stress  the sympathoadrenal medullary  sam  axis may activate the fight or flight response through the sympathetic nervous system  which dedicates energy to more relevant bodily systems to acute adaption to stress  while the parasympathetic nervous system returns the body to homeostasis  the second major physiological stress system  the hpa axis regulates the release of cortisol  which influences many bodily functions such as metabolic  psychological and immunological functions  the sam and hpa axes are regulated by a wide variety of brain regions  including the limbic system  prefrontal cortex  amygdala  hypothalamus  and stria terminalis  1  through these mechanisms  stress can alter memory functions  reward  immune function  metabolism and susceptibility to diseases  2  definitions of stress differ  however  one system proposed by elliot and eisdorfer suggests five types of stress  the five types of stress are labeled  acute time limited stressors    brief naturalistic stressors    stressful event sequence    chronic stressors   and  distant stressors   acute time limited stressors involve a short term challenge  while brief naturalistic stressors involve an event that is normal but nevertheless challenging  stressful event sequences are a stressor that occur  and continue to yield stress into the immediate future  chronic stressors are stressors that involve exposure to a long-term stressor  a distant stressor is a stressor that isn t immediate  3       there is likely a connection between stress and illness  theories of the stress u2013illness link suggest that both acute and chronic stress can cause illness  and several studies have suggested such a link  4  according to these studies  both acute and chronic stress can lead to changes in behavior and in physiology  behavioral changes can include smoking  changes in eating habits and physical activity  physiological changes can include changes in sympathetic activation or hpa activity  and immunological function  5  however  there is much variability in the link between stress and illness  6   the hpa axis regulates many bodily functions  both behavioral and physiological  through the release of glucocorticoid hormones  the hpa axis activity varies according to the circadian rhythm  with a spike in the morning  the axis involves the release of corticotropin releasing hormone and vasopressin from the hypothalamus which stimulates the pituitary to secrete acth  acth may then stimulate the adrenal glands to secrete cortisol  the hpa axis is subject to negative feedback regulation as well  the release of crh and vp are regulated by descending glutaminergic and gabaergic pathways from the amygdala  as well as noradrenergic projections  increased cortisol usually acts to increase blood glucose  blood pressure  and surpasses lysosomal  and immunological activity  under other circumstances  however  the activity may differ  increased cortisol also favors habit based learning  by favoring memory consolidation of emotional memories  7   selye demonstrated that stress decreases adaptability of an organism and proposed to describe the adaptability as a special resource  adaptation energy  8  in recent works  it is considered as an internal coordinate on the  dominant path  in the model of adaptation  9  stress can make the individual more susceptible to physical illnesses like the common cold  10  stressful events  such as job changes  may result in insomnia  impaired sleeping  and health complaints  11  research indicates the type of stressor  whether it s acute or chronic  and individual characteristics such as age and physical well-being before the onset of the stressor can combine to determine the effect of stress on an individual  4  an individual s personality characteristics  such as level of neuroticism   12  genetics  and childhood experiences with major stressors and traumas 13  may also dictate their response to stressors  4   chronic stress and a lack of coping resources available or used by an individual can often lead to the development of psychological issues such as depression and anxiety  see below for further information   14  this is particularly true regarding chronic stressors  these are stressors that may not be as intense as an acute stressor like a natural disaster or a major accident  but they persist over longer periods of time  these types of stressors tend to have a more negative effect on health because they are sustained and thus require the body s physiological response to occur daily  this depletes the body s energy more quickly and usually occurs over long periods of time  especially when these microstressors cannot be avoided  i e - stress of living in a dangerous neighborhood   see allostatic load for further discussion of the biological process by which chronic stress may affect the body  for example  studies have found that caregivers  particularly those of dementia patients  have higher levels of depression and slightly worse physical health than noncaregivers  15   it has long been believed that negative affective states  such as feelings of anxiety and depression  could influence the pathogenesis of physical disease  however recent studies done by the university of wisconsin-madison and other places have shown this to be untrue  it isn t stress itself that causes the increased risk of illness or death  it is actually the perception that stress is harmful  16  for example  when humans are under chronic stress  permanent changes in their physiological  emotional  and behavioral responses are most likely to occur  17][18  such changes could lead to disease  chronic stress can include events such as caring for a spouse with dementia  or results from brief focal events that with long term effects  such as experiencing a sexual assault  studies have also showed that psychological stress may directly contribute to the disproportionately high rates of coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality and its etiologic risk factors  specifically  acute and chronic stress have been shown to raise serum lipids and are associated with clinical coronary events  19   however  it is possible for individuals to exhibit hardiness u2014a term referring to the ability to be both chronically stressed and healthy  20  even though psychological stress is often connected with illness or disease  most healthy individuals can still remain disease-free after confronting chronic stressful events  this suggests that there are individual differences in vulnerability to the potential pathogenic effects of stress  individual differences in vulnerability arise due to both genetic and psychological factors  in addition  the age at which the stress is experienced can dictate its effect on health  research suggests chronic stress at a young age can have lifelong effects on the biological  psychological  and behavioral responses to stress later in life  21  recent studies have shown that severe psychological stress resulting in ptsd can also significantly affect parenting perception  behavior  neural activity and hpa-axis physiology in response to stressful parent-infant interactions  22  these recent studies support the existence of intergenerational effects of early chronic psychological stress  23   in animals  stress contributes to the initiation  growth  and metastasis of select tumors  but studies that try to link stress and cancer incidence in humans have had mixed results  this can be due to practical difficulties in designing and implementing adequate studies  18   the term  stress  had none of its contemporary connotations before the 1920s  it is a form of the middle english destresse  derived via old french from the latin stringere   to draw tight   24  the word had long been in use in physics to refer to the internal distribution of a force exerted on a material body  resulting in strain  in the 1920s and '30s  biological and psychological circles occasionally used the term to refer to a mental strain or to a harmful environmental agent that could cause illness   walter cannon used it in 1926 to refer to external factors that disrupted what he called homeostasis  25  but     stress as an explanation of lived experience is absent from both lay and expert life narratives before the 1930s   26  physiological stress represents a wide range of physical responses that occur as a direct effect of a stressor causing an upset in the homeostasis of the body  upon immediate disruption of either psychological or physical equilibrium the body responds by stimulating the nervous  endocrine  and immune systems  the reaction of these systems causes a number of physical changes that have both short- and long-term effects on the body  citation needed   the holmes and rahe stress scale was developed as a method of assessing risk of disease from life changes  27  the scale lists both positive and negative changes that elicit stress  these include things such as a major holiday or marriage  or death of a spouse and firing from a job   homeostasis is a concept central to the idea of stress  28  in biology  most biochemical processes strive to maintain equilibrium  homeostasis   a steady state that exists more as an ideal and less as an achievable condition  environmental factors  internal or external stimuli  continually disrupt homeostasis  an organism s present condition is a state of constant flux moving about a homeostatic point that is that organism s optimal condition for living  29  factors causing an organism s condition to diverge too far from homeostasis can be experienced as stress  a life-threatening situation such as a major physical trauma or prolonged starvation can greatly disrupt homeostasis  on the other hand  an organism s attempt at restoring conditions back to or near homeostasis  often consuming energy and natural resources  can also be interpreted as stress  30   the ambiguity in defining this phenomenon was first recognized by hans selye (1907-1982  in 1926  in 1951 a commentator loosely summarized selye s view of stress as something that "\u2026in addition to being itself  was also the cause of itself  and the result of itself   31][32   first to use the term in a biological context  selye continued to define stress as  the non-specific response of the body to any demand placed upon it   as of 2011 update  neuroscientists such as bruce mcewen and jaap koolhaas believe that stress  based on years of empirical research   should be restricted to conditions where an environmental demand exceeds the natural regulatory capacity of an organism   33   stress can have many profound effects on the human biological systems  34  biology primarily attempts to explain major concepts of stress using a stimulus-response paradigm  broadly comparable to how a psychobiological sensory system operates  the central nervous system  brain and spinal cord  plays a crucial role in the body s stress-related mechanisms  whether one should interpret these mechanisms as the body s response to a stressor or embody the act of stress itself is part of the ambiguity in defining what exactly stress is  nevertheless  the central nervous system works closely with the body s endocrine system to regulate these mechanisms  the sympathetic nervous system becomes primarily active during a stress response  regulating many of the body s physiological functions in ways that ought to make an organism more adaptive to its environment  below there follows a brief biological background of neuroanatomy and neurochemistry and how they relate to stress  citation needed   stress  either severe  acute stress or chronic low-grade stress may induce abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body  serotonin systems  catecholamine systems  and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis  aggressive behavior has also been associated with abnormalities in these systems  35   the brain endocrine interactions are relevant in the translation of stress into physiological and psychological changes  the autonomic nervous system  as mentioned above  plays an important role in translating stress into a response  the ans responds reflexively to both physical stressors for example baroreception   and to higher level inputs from the brain  36  the ans is composed of the parasympathetic nervous system and sympathetic nervous system  two branches that are both tonically active with opposing activities  the ans directly innervates tissue through the postganglionic nerves  which is controlled by preganglionic neurons originating in the intermediolateral cell column  the ans receives inputs from the medulla  hypothalamus  limbic system  prefrontal cortex  midbrain and monoamine nuclei  37  the activity of the sympathetic nervous system drives what sometimes called the  fight or flight  response  the fight or flight response to emergency or stress involves mydriasis  increased heart rate and force contraction  vasoconstriction  bronchodialation  glycogenolysis  gluconeogenesis  lipolysis  sweating  decreased motility of the digestive system  secretion of the epinephrine and cortisol from the adrenal medulla  and relaxation of the bladder wall  the parasympathetic nervous response   rest and digest   involves return to maintaining homeostasis  and involves miosis  bronchoconstriction  increased activity of the digestive system  and contraction of the bladder walls  36  complex relationships between protective and vulnerability factors on the effect of childhood home stress on psychological illness  cardiovascular illness and adaption have been observed  38  ans related mechanisms are though to contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular disease after major stressful events 39   the hpa axis is a neuroendocrine system that mediates a stress response  neurons in the hypothalamus  particularly the paraventricular nucleus  release vasopressin and corticotropin releasing hormone  which travels through the hyphophysial portal vessel where it travels to and binds to corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor on the anterior pituitary gland  multiple crh peptides have been identified  and receptors have been identified on multiple areas of the brain  including the amygdala  however  crh is the main regulatory molecule of the release of acth  the secretion of acth into systemic circulation allows it to bind to and activate melanocortin receptor  where it stimulates the release of steroid hormones  steroid hormones bind to glucocorticoid receptors in the brain  providing negative feedback by reducing acth release  some evidence supports a second long term feedback that is non-sensitive to cortisol secretion  the pvn of the hypothalamus receives inputs from the nucleus of the solitary tract  and lamina terminalis  through these inputs  it receives and can respond to changes in blood  the pvn innervation from the brain stem nuclei  particularly the noradrenergic nuclei stimulate crh release  other regions of the hypothalamus both directly and indirectly inhibit hpa axis activity  hypothalamic neurons involved in regulating energy balance also influence hpa axis activity through the release of the neurotransmitters such as neuropeptide y  which stimulates hpa axis activity  generally  the amygdala stimulates  and the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus attenuate hpa axis activity  however complex relationships do exist between the regions  40   the immune system may be heavily influenced by stress  the sympathetic nervous system innervates various immunological structures  such as bone marrow and the spleen  allowing for it to regulate immune function  the adrenergic substances released by the sympathetic nervous system can also bind to and influence various immunological cells  further providing a connection between the systems  the hpa axis ultimately results in the release of cortisol  which generally has immunosuppressive effects  however  the effect of stress on the immune system is disputed  and various models have been proposed in an attempt to account for both the supposedly  immunodeficiency  linked diseases and diseases involving hyper activation of the immune system  the most recent model proposed to account for this suggests an push towards an imbalance of cellular immunity th1  and humoral immunity th2   the proposed imbalance involved hyperactivity of the th2 system leading to some forms of immune hypersensitivity  while also increasing risk of some illnesses associated with decreased immune system function  such as infection and cancer  3   chronic stress is a term sometimes used to differentiate between acute stress  definitions differ  and may be along the lines of continual activation of the stress response  41  stress that causes an allostatic shift in bodily functions  2  or just as  prolonged stress   42  for example  results of one study demonstrated that individuals who reported relationship conflict lasting one month or longer have a greater risk of developing illness and show slower wound healing  similarly  the effects that acute stressors have on the immune system may be increased when there is perceived stress and or anxiety due to other events  for example  students who are taking exams show weaker immune responses if they also report stress due to daily hassles  43  while responses to acute stressors typically do not impose a health burden on young  healthy individuals  chronic stress in older or unhealthy individuals may have long-term effects that are detrimental to health  44   acute time limited stressors  or stressors that lasted less than two hours  results in an up regulation of natural immunity and down regulation of specific immunity  this type of stress saw in increase in granulocytes  natural killer cells  iga  interleukin 6  and an increase in cell cytotoxicity  brief naturalistic stressors elicit a shift from th1 cellular  to th2 humoral  immunity  while decreased t-cell proliferation  and natural killer cell cytotoxicity  stressful event sequences did not elicit a consistent immune response  however some observations such as decreased t-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity  increase or decrease in natural killer cell cytotoxicity  and an increase in mitogen pha  chronic stress elicited a shirt toward th2 immunity  as well as decreased interleukin 2  t cell proliferation  and antibody response to the influenza vaccine  distant stressors did not consistently elicit a change in immune function  3   some studies have observed increased risk of upper respiratory tract infection during chronic life stress  in patients with hiv  increased life stress and cortisol was associated with poorer progression of hiv  45   a link has been suggested between chronic stress and cardiovascular disease  46  stress appears to play a role in hypertension  and may further predispose people to other conditions associated with hypertension  47  stress may also precipitate a more serious  or relapse into abuse of alcohol  2  stress may also contribute to aging and chronic diseases in aging  such as depression and metabolic disorders  7  the immune system also plays a role in stress and the early stages of wound healing  it is responsible for preparing the tissue for repair and promoting recruitment of certain cells to the wound area  43  consistent with the fact that stress alters the production of cytokines  graham et al  found that chronic stress associated with care giving for a person with alzheimer s disease leads to delayed wound healing  results indicated that biopsy wounds healed 25  more slowly in the chronically stressed group  or those caring for a person with alzheimer s disease  48   chronic stress has also been shown to impair developmental growth in children by lowering the pituitary gland s production of growth hormone  as in children associated with a home environment involving serious marital discord  alcoholism  or child abuse  49   more generally  prenatal life  infancy  childhood  and adolescence are critical periods in which the vulnerability to stressors is particularly high  50][51   chronic stress is seen to affect the parts of the brain where memories are processed through and stored  when people feel stressed  stress hormones get over-secreted  which affects the brain  this secretion is made up of glucocorticoids  including cortisol  which are steroid hormones that the adrenal gland releases  although this can increase storage of flashbulb memories it decreases long-term potentation (ltp   52  [53  the hippocampus is important in the brain for storing certain kinds of memories and damage to the hippocampus can cause trouble in storing new memories but old memories  memories stored before the damage  are not lost  54  also high cortisol levels can be tied to the deterioration of the hippocampus and decline of memory that many older adults start to experience with age  53   chronic stress also shifts learning  forming a preference for habit based learning  and decreased task flexibility and spatial working memory  probably through alterations of the dopaminergic systems  37  stress may also increase reward associated with food  leading to weight gain and further changes in eating habits  55  stress may contribute to various psychosomatic disorders  such as fibromyalgia  56  chronic fatigue syndrome  57  depression  58  and functional somatic syndromes  59   selye published in year 1975 a model dividing stress into eustress and distress  60  where stress enhances function  physical or mental  such as through strength training or challenging work   it may be considered eustress  persistent stress that is not resolved through coping or adaptation  deemed distress  may lead to anxiety or withdrawal  depression  behavior   the difference between experiences that result in eustress and those that result in distress is determined by the disparity between an experience  real or imagined  and personal expectations  and resources to cope with the stress  alarming experiences  either real or imagined  can trigger a stress response  61   responses to stress include adaptation  psychological coping such as stress management  anxiety  and depression  over the long term  distress can lead to diminished health and or increased propensity to illness  to avoid this  stress must be managed   stress management encompasses techniques intended to equip a person with effective coping mechanisms for dealing with psychological stress  with stress defined as a person s physiological response to an internal or external stimulus that triggers the fight-or-flight response  stress management is effective when a person uses strategies to cope with or alter stressful situations   there are several ways of coping with stress  62  such as controlling the source of stress or learning to set limits and to say  no  to some of the demands that bosses or family members may make   a person s capacity to tolerate the source of stress may be increased by thinking about another topic such as a hobby  listening to music  or spending time in a wilderness   a way to control stress is first dealing with what is causing the stress if it is something the individual has control over  other methods to control stress and reduce it can be  to not procrastinate and leave tasks for last minute  do things you like  exercise  do breathing routines  go out with friends  and take a break  having support from a loved one also helps a lot in reducing stress  53   a study was done and it showed that the power of having support from a loved one or just social support  lowered stress in the individuals  they gave painful shocks to married women s ankles  on some trials women were able to hold their husbands hand  on other trials they held a strangers hand  and then held no one s hand  when the women were holding their husbands hand  the response reduced in many brain areas  when holding the strangers hand the response reduced a little but not as much as when they were holding their husbands hand  social support helps reduce stress but even more if the support is from a loved one  53   lazarus 63  argued that  in order for a psychosocial situation to be stressful  it must be appraised as such  he argued that cognitive processes of appraisal are central in determining whether a situation is potentially threatening  constitutes a harm loss or a challenge  or is benign   both personal and environmental factors influence this primary appraisal  which then triggers the selection of coping processes  problem-focused coping is directed at managing the problem  whereas emotion-focused coping processes are directed at managing the negative emotions  secondary appraisal refers to the evaluation of the resources available to cope with the problem  and may alter the primary appraisal   in other words  primary appraisal includes the perception of how stressful the problem is and the secondary appraisal of estimating whether one has more than or less than adequate resources to deal with the problem that affects the overall appraisal of stressfulness  further  coping is flexible in that  in general  the individual examines the effectiveness of the coping on the situation  if it is not having the desired effect  s he will  in general  try different strategies  64   a renewed interest in salivary alpha amylase as a marker for stress has surfaced  yamaguchi m  yoshida h (2005  have analyzed a newly introduced hand-held device called the cocorometer developed by nipro corporation of japan  they state that this can be reliably used to analyze the amylase levels and is definitely a cheaper alternative as compared to the more expensive elisa kits  the working consists of a meter and a saliva collecting chip  which can be inserted into the meter to give the readings  the levels of amylase obtained have been calibrated according to standard population  and can be categorized into four levels of severity  65   measuring stress levels independent of differences in people s personalities has been inherently difficult  some people are able to process many stressors simultaneously  while others can barely address a few  such tests as the trier social stress test attempted to isolate the effects of personalities on ability to handle stress in a laboratory environment  other psychologists  however  proposed measuring stress indirectly  through self-tests   because the amount of stressors in a person s life often  although not always  correlates with the amount of stress that person experiences  researchers combine the results of stress and burnout self-tests  stress tests help determine the number of stressors in a person s life  while burnout tests determine the degree to which the person is close to the state of burnout  combining both helps researchers gauge how likely additional stressors will make him or her experience mental exhaustion  66   both negative and positive stressors can lead to stress  the intensity and duration of stress changes depending on the circumstances and emotional condition of the person suffering from it  arnold  e and boggs  k  2007   some common categories and examples of stressors include   physiologists define stress as how the body reacts to a stressor  real or imagined  a stimulus that causes stress  acute stressors affect an organism in the short term  chronic stressors over the longer term  the general adaptation syndrome  gas   developed by hans selye  is a profile of how organisms respond to stress  gas is characterized by three phases  a nonspecific mobilization phase  which promotes sympathetic nervous system activity  a resistance phase  during which the organism makes efforts to cope with the threat  and an exhaustion phase  which occurs if the organism fails to overcome the threat and depletes its physiological resources  72   alarm is the first stage  which is divided into two phases  the shock phase and the antishock phase  73   resistance is the second stage and increased secretion of glucocorticoids play a major role  intensifying the systemic response u2014they have lipolytic  catabolic and antianabolic effects  increased glucose  fat and aminoacid protein concentration in blood  moreover  they cause lymphocytopenia  eosinopenia  neutrophilia and polycythemia  in high doses  cortisol begins to act as a mineralocorticoid  aldosterone  and brings the body to a state similar to hyperaldosteronism  if the stressor persists  it becomes necessary to attempt some means of coping with the stress  although the body begins to try to adapt to the strains or demands of the environment  the body cannot keep this up indefinitely  so its resources are gradually depleted   the third stage could be either exhaustion or recovery   the result can manifest itself in obvious illnesses  such as peptic ulcer and general trouble with the digestive system  e g  occult bleeding  melena  constipation obstipation   diabetes  or even cardiovascular problems  angina pectoris   along with clinical depression and other mental illnesses  citation needed   the current usage of the word stress arose out of selye s 1930s experiments  he started to use the term to refer not just to the agent but to the state of the organism as it responded and adapted to the environment  his theories of a universal non-specific stress response attracted great interest and contention in academic physiology and he undertook extensive research programs and publication efforts  74   while the work attracted continued support from advocates of psychosomatic medicine  many in experimental physiology concluded that his concepts were too vague and unmeasurable  during the 1950s  selye turned away from the laboratory to promote his concept through popular books and lecture tours  he wrote for both non-academic physicians and  in an international bestseller entitled stress of life  for the general public   a broad biopsychosocial concept of stress and adaptation offered the promise of helping everyone achieve health and happiness by successfully responding to changing global challenges and the problems of modern civilization  selye coined the term  eustress  for positive stress  by contrast to distress  he argued that all people have a natural urge and need to work for their own benefit  a message that found favor with industrialists and governments  74  he also coined the term stressor to refer to the causative event or stimulus  as opposed to the resulting state of stress   from the late 1960s  academic psychologists started to adopt selye s concept  they sought to quantify  life stress  by scoring  significant life events   and a large amount of research was undertaken to examine links between stress and disease of all kinds  by the late 1970s  stress had become the medical area of greatest concern to the general population  and more basic research was called for to better address the issue  there was also renewed laboratory research into the neuroendocrine  molecular  and immunological bases of stress  conceived as a useful heuristic not necessarily tied to selye s original hypotheses  the us military became a key center of stress research  attempting to understand and reduce combat neurosis and psychiatric casualties  74   the psychiatric diagnosis post-traumatic stress disorder  ptsd  was coined in the mid-1970s  in part through the efforts of anti-vietnam war activists and the vietnam veterans against the war  and chaim f  shatan  the condition was added to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders as posttraumatic stress disorder in 1980.[75  ptsd was considered a severe and ongoing emotional reaction to an extreme psychological trauma  and as such often associated with soldiers  police officers  and other emergency personnel  the stressor may involve threat to life  or viewing the actual death of someone else   serious physical injury  or threat to physical or psychological integrity  in some cases  it can also be from profound psychological and emotional trauma  apart from any actual physical harm or threat  often  however  the two are combined   by the 1990s   stress  had become an integral part of modern scientific understanding in all areas of physiology and human functioning  and one of the great metaphors of western life  focus grew on stress in certain settings  such as workplace stress  and stress management techniques were developed  the term also became a euphemism  a way of referring to problems and eliciting sympathy without being explicitly confessional  just  stressed out   it came to cover a huge range of phenomena from mild irritation to the kind of severe problems that might result in a real breakdown of health  in popular usage  almost any event or situation between these extremes could be described as stressful
