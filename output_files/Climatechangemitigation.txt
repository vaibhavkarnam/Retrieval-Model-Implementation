Climatechangemitigation
 climate change mitigation consists of actions to limit the magnitude or rate of long-term climate change  3  climate change mitigation generally involves reductions in human  anthropogenic  emissions of greenhouse gases (ghgs   4  mitigation may also be achieved by increasing the capacity of carbon sinks  e g   through reforestation  4  mitigation policies can substantially reduce the risks associated with human-induced global warming  5   according to the ipcc s 2014 assessment report   mitigation is a public good  climate change is a case of the  tragedy of the commons  effective climate change mitigation will not be achieved if each agent  individual  institution or country  acts independently in its own selfish interest  see international cooperation and emissions trading   suggesting the need for collective action  some adaptation actions  on the other hand  have characteristics of a private good as benefits of actions may accrue more directly to the individuals  regions  or countries that undertake them  at least in the short term  nevertheless  financing such adaptive activities remains an issue  particularly for poor individuals and countries   6   examples of mitigation include phasing out fossil fuels by switching to low-carbon energy sources  such as renewable and nuclear energy  and expanding forests and other  sinks  to remove greater amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  4  energy efficiency may also play a role  7  for example  through improving the insulation of buildings  8  another approach to climate change mitigation is climate engineering  9   most countries are parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc   10  the ultimate objective of the unfccc is to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of ghgs at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system  11  scientific analysis can provide information on the impacts of climate change  but deciding which impacts are dangerous requires value judgments  12   in 2010  parties to the unfccc agreed that future global warming should be limited to below 2.0\xa0\xb0c (3.6\xa0\xb0f  relative to the pre-industrial level  13  with the paris agreement of 2015 this was confirmed  but was revised with a new target laying down  parties will do the best  to achieve warming below 1.5\xa0\xb0c  14  the current trajectory of global greenhouse gas emissions does not appear to be consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5 or 2\xa0\xb0c  15  other mitigation policies have been proposed  some of which are more stringent 16  or modest 17][18  than the 2\xa0\xb0c limit   one of the issues often discussed in relation to climate change mitigation is the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere  the united nations framework convention on climate change  unfccc  has the ultimate objective of preventing  dangerous  anthropogenic  i e   human  interference of the climate system  as is stated in article 2 of the convention  this requires that greenhouse gas  ghg  concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change  food production is not threatened  and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion  20   there are a number of anthropogenic greenhouse gases  these include carbon dioxide  chemical formula  co2   methane (ch n4   nitrous oxide (n n2o   and a group of gases referred to as halocarbons  21  the emissions reductions necessary to stabilize the atmospheric concentrations of these gases varies  19  co2 is the most important of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases  see radiative forcing   22   there is a difference between stabilizing co2 emissions and stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of co2.[23  stabilizing emissions of co2 at current levels would not lead to a stabilization in the atmospheric concentration of co2  in fact  stabilizing emissions at current levels would result in the atmospheric concentration of co2 continuing to rise over the 21st century and beyond  see the graphs opposite    the reason for this is that human activities are adding co2 to the atmosphere far faster than natural processes can remove it  see carbon dioxide in earth s atmosphere for a complete explanation   19  this is analogous to a flow of water into a bathtub  24  so long as the tap runs water  analogous to the emission of carbon dioxide  into the tub faster than water escapes through the plughole  the natural removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere   then the level of water in the tub  analogous to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  will continue to rise   according to some studies  stabilizing atmospheric co2 concentrations would require anthropogenic co2 emissions to be reduced by 80  relative to the peak emissions level  25  an 80  reduction in emissions would stabilize co2 concentrations for around a century  but even greater reductions would be required beyond this  19][25  other research has found that  after leaving room for emissions for food production for 9 billion people and to keep the global temperature rise below 2\xa0\xb0c  emissions from energy production and transport will have to peak almost immediately in the developed world and decline at ca  10  per annum until zero emissions are reached around 2030  in developing countries energy and transport emissions would have to peak by 2025 and then decline similarly  26][27][28][29   stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of the other greenhouse gasses humans emit also depends on how fast their emissions are added to the atmosphere  and how fast the ghgs are removed  stabilization for these gases is described in the later section on non-co2 ghgs   projections of future greenhouse gas emissions are highly uncertain  30  in the absence of policies to mitigate climate change  ghg emissions could rise significantly over the 21st century  31   numerous assessments have considered how atmospheric ghg concentrations could be stabilized  32  the lower the desired stabilization level  the sooner global ghg emissions must peak and decline  33  ghg concentrations are unlikely to stabilize this century without major policy changes  31   to create lasting climate change mitigation  the replacement of high carbon emission intensity power sources  such as conventional fossil fuels u2014oil  coal and natural gas u2014with low-carbon power sources is required  fossil fuels supply humanity with the vast majority of our energy demands  and at a growing rate  in 2012 the iea noted that coal accounted for half the increased energy use of the prior decade  growing faster than all renewable energy sources  35  both hydroelectricity and nuclear power together provide the majority of the generated low-carbon power fraction of global total power consumption   assessments often suggest that ghg emissions can be reduced using a portfolio of low-carbon technologies  39  at the core of most proposals is the reduction of greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions through reducing energy waste and switching to low-carbon power sources of energy  as the cost of reducing ghg emissions in the electricity sector appears to be lower than in other sectors  such as in the transportation sector  the electricity sector may deliver the largest proportional carbon reductions under an economically efficient climate policy  40    economic tools can be useful in designing climate change mitigation policies    while the limitations of economics and social welfare analysis  including cost u2013benefit analysis  are widely documented  economics nevertheless provides useful tools for assessing the pros and cons of taking  or not taking  action on climate change mitigation  as well as of adaptation measures  in achieving competing societal goals  understanding these pros and cons can help in making policy decisions on climate change mitigation and can influence the actions taken by countries  institutions and individuals   6   other frequently discussed means include energy conservation  increasing fuel economy in automobiles  which includes the use of electric hybrids   charging plug-in hybrids and electric cars by low-carbon electricity  making individual-lifestyle changes 41   e g   cycling instead of driving   42  and changing business practices  many fossil fuel driven vehicles can be converted to use electricity  the u s  has the potential to supply electricity for 73  of light duty vehicles  ldv   using overnight charging  the us average co2 emissions for a battery-electric car is 180 grams per mile vs 430 grams per mile for a gasoline car  43  the emissions would be displaced away from street level  where they have  high human-health implications  increased use of electricity  generation for meeting the future transportation load is primarily fossil-fuel based   mostly natural gas  followed by coal  44  but could also be met through nuclear  tidal  hydroelectric and other sources   a range of energy technologies may contribute to climate change mitigation  45  these include nuclear power and renewable energy sources such as biomass  hydroelectricity  wind power  solar power  geothermal power  ocean energy  and  the use of carbon sinks  and carbon capture and storage  for example  pacala and socolow of princeton 46  have proposed a 15 part program to reduce co2 emissions by 1 billion metric tons per year \u2212 or 25 billion tons over the 50-year period using today s technologies as a type of global warming game  47   another consideration is how future socio-economic development proceeds  development choices  or  pathways   can lead differences in ghg emissions  48  political and social attitudes may affect how easy or difficult it is to implement effective policies to reduce emissions  49   renewable energy flows involve natural phenomena such as sunlight  wind  rain  tides  plant growth  and geothermal heat  as the international energy agency explains  52   renewable energy is derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly  in its various forms  it derives directly from the sun  or from heat generated deep within the earth  included in the definition is electricity and heat generated from solar  wind  ocean  hydropower  biomass  geothermal resources  and biofuels and hydrogen derived from renewable resources   climate change concerns 53][54][55  and the need to reduce carbon emissions are driving increasing growth in the renewable energy industries  56][57][58  low-carbon renewable energy replaces conventional fossil fuels in three main areas  power generation  hot water  space heating  and transport fuels  59  in 2011  the share of renewables in electricity generation worldwide grew for the fourth year in a row to 20.2%.[60  based on ren21 s 2014 report  renewables contributed 19  to supply global energy consumption  this energy consumption is divided as 9  coming from burning biomass  4.2  as heat energy  non-biomass   3.8  hydro electricity and 2  as electricity from wind  solar  geothermal  and biomass thermal power plants  61   renewable energy use has grown much faster than anyone anticipated  62  the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand  63  at the national level  at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20  of energy supply   as of 2012  renewable energy accounts for almost half of new electricity capacity installed and costs are continuing to fall  64  public policy and political leadership helps to  level the playing field  and drive the wider acceptance of renewable energy technologies  65  as of 2011 update   118 countries have targets for their own renewable energy futures  and have enacted wide-ranging public policies to promote renewables  66][67  leading renewable energy companies include brightsource energy  first solar  gamesa  ge energy  goldwind  sinovel  suntech  trina solar  vestas and yingli  68][69   the incentive to use 100  renewable energy has been created by global warming and other ecological as well as economic concerns  62  mark z  jacobson says producing all new energy with wind power  solar power  and hydropower by 2030 is feasible and existing energy supply arrangements could be replaced by 2050  barriers to implementing the renewable energy plan are seen to be  primarily social and political  not technological or economic   jacobson says that energy costs with a wind  solar  water system should be similar to today s energy costs  70  according to a 2011 projection by the  iea international energy agency  solar power generators may produce most of the world s electricity within 50 years  dramatically reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions  71  critics of the "100  renewable energy  approach include vaclav smil and james e  hansen  smil and hansen are concerned about the variable output of solar and wind power  nimbyism  and a lack of infrastructure  72   economic analysts expect market gains for renewable energy  and efficient energy use  following the 2011 japanese nuclear accidents  73][74  in his 2012 state of the union address  president barack obama restated his commitment to renewable energy and mentioned the long-standing interior department commitment to permit 10,000 mw of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012.[75  globally  there are an estimated 3 million direct jobs in renewable energy industries  with about half of them in the biofuels industry  76   some countries  with favorable geography  geology and weather well suited to an economical exploitation of renewable energy sources  already get most of their electricity from renewables  including from geothermal energy in iceland (100 percent   and hydroelectric power in brazil (85 percent   austria (62 percent   new zealand (65 percent   and sweden (54 percent   77  renewable power generators are spread across many countries  with wind power providing a significant share of electricity in some regional areas  for example  14 percent in the u s  state of iowa  40 percent in the northern german state of schleswig-holstein  and 20 percent in denmark  solar water heating makes an important and growing contribution in many countries  most notably in china  which now has 70 percent of the global total (180 gwth   worldwide  total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households  the use of biomass for heating continues to grow as well  in sweden  national use of biomass energy has surpassed that of oil  direct geothermal heating is also growing rapidly  77  renewable biofuels for transportation  such as ethanol fuel and biodiesel  have contributed to a significant decline in oil consumption in the united states since 2006  the 93\xa0billion liters of biofuels produced worldwide in 2009 displaced the equivalent of an estimated 68\xa0billion liters of gasoline  equal to about 5 percent of world gasoline production  77   since about 2001 the term  nuclear renaissance  has been used to refer to a possible nuclear power industry revival  driven by rising fossil fuel prices and new concerns about meeting greenhouse gas emission limits  78  however  in march 2011 the fukushima nuclear disaster in japan and associated shutdowns at other nuclear facilities raised questions among some commentators over the future of nuclear power  79][80][81  platts has reported that  the crisis at japan s fukushima nuclear plants has prompted leading energy-consuming countries to review the safety of their existing reactors and cast doubt on the speed and scale of planned expansions around the world   82   the world nuclear association has reported that nuclear electricity generation in 2012 was at its lowest level since 1999.[83  several previous international studies and assessments  84][85][86  suggested that as part of the portfolio of other low-carbon energy technologies  nuclear power will continue to play a role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions  historically  nuclear power usage is estimated to have prevented the atmospheric emission of 64 gigatonnes of co2-equivalent as of 2013.[87  public concerns about nuclear power include the fate of spent nuclear fuel  nuclear accidents  security risks  nuclear proliferation  and a concern that nuclear power plants are very expensive  88][89][90  of these concerns  nuclear accidents and disposal of long-lived radioactive fuel  waste  have probably had the greatest public impact worldwide  88  although generally unaware of it  both of these glaring public concerns are greatly diminished by present passive safety designs  the experimentally proven   melt-down proof  ebr-ii  future molten salt reactors  and the use of conventional and more advanced fuel  waste  pyroprocessing  91  with the latter recycling or reprocessing disambiguation needed  not presently being commonplace as it is often considered to be cheaper to use a once-through nuclear fuel cycle in many countries  depending on the varying levels of intrinsic value given by a society in reducing the long-lived waste in their country  with france doing a considerable amount of reprocessing when compared to the us  92][93   nuclear power  with a 10.6  share of world electricity production as of 2013  is second only to hydroelectricity as the largest source of low-carbon power  94  over 400 reactors generate electricity in 31 countries  95   a yale university review published in the journal of industrial ecology analyzing co2 life cycle assessment lca  emissions from nuclear power light water reactors  determined that   the collective lca literature indicates that life cycle ghg emissions from nuclear power are only a fraction of traditional fossil sources and comparable to renewable technologies   96  while some have raised uncertainty surrounding the future ghg emissions of nuclear power as a result of an extreme potential decline in uranium ore grade without a corresponding increase in the efficiency of enrichment methods  in a scenario analysis of future global nuclear development  as it could be effected by a decreasing global uranium market of average ore grade  the analysis determined that depending on conditions  median life cycle nuclear power ghg emissions could be between 9 and 110\xa0g co2-eq kwh by 2050  with the latter high figure being derived from a  worst-case scenario  that is not  considered very robust  by the authors of the paper  as the  ore grade  in the scenario is lower than the uranium concentration in many lignite coal ashes  96   although this future analyses primarily deals with extrapolations for present generation ii reactor technology  the same paper also summarizes the literature on  fbrs  fast breeder reactors  of which two are in operation as of 2014 with the newest being the bn-800  for these reactors it states that the  median life cycle ghg emissions xa0     are  similar to or lower than  present light water reactors  lwrs and purports to consume little or no uranium ore  96   in their 2014 report  the ipcc comparison of energy sources global warming potential per unit of electricity generated  which notably included albedo effects  mirror the median emission value derived from the warner and heath yale meta-analysis for the more common non-breeding light water reactors  a co2-equivalent value of 12\xa0g co2-eq kwh  which is the lowest global warming forcing of all baseload power sources  with comparable low carbon power baseload sources  such as hydropower and biomass  producing substantially more global warming forcing 24 and 230\xa0g co2-eq kwh respectively  97   in 2014  brookings institution published the net benefits of low and no-carbon electricity technologies which states  after performing an energy and emissions cost analysis  that  the net benefits of new nuclear  hydro  and natural gas combined cycle plants far outweigh the net benefits of new wind or solar plants   with the most cost effective low carbon power technology being determined to be nuclear power  98][99][100   during his presidential campaign  barack obama stated   nuclear power represents more than 70  of our noncarbon generated electricity  it is unlikely that we can meet our aggressive climate goals if we eliminate nuclear power as an option   101   analysis in 2015 by professor and chair of environmental sustainability barry w  brook and his colleagues on the topic of replacing fossil fuels entirely  from the electric grid of the world  has determined that at the historically modest and proven-rate at which nuclear energy was added to and replaced fossil fuels in france and sweden during each nation s building programs in the 1980s  within 10 years nuclear energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely   allow ing  the world to meet the most stringent greenhouse-gas mitigation targets    102  in a similar analysis  brook had earlier determined that 50  of all global energy  that is not solely electricity  but transportation synfuels etc  could be generated within approximately 30 years  if the global nuclear fission build rate was identical to each of these nation s already proven decadal rates in units of installed nameplate capacity  gw per year  per unit of global gdp gw year     103][104][105   this is in contrast to the completely conceptual paper-studies for a 100  renewable energy world  which would require an orders of magnitude more costly global investment per year  an investment rate that has no historical precedent  having never been attempted due to its prohibitive cost  104][106  and with far greater land area that would be required to be devoted to the wind  wave and solar projects  along with the inherent assumption that humanity will use less  and not more  energy in the future  103][104][105  as brook notes the  principal limitations on nuclear fission are not technical  economic or fuel-related  but are instead linked to complex issues of societal acceptance  fiscal and political inertia  and inadequate critical evaluation of the real-world constraints facing  the other  low-carbon alternatives   103   nuclear power may be uncompetitive compared with fossil fuel energy sources in countries without a carbon tax program  and in comparison to a fossil fuel plant of the same power output  nuclear power plants take a longer amount of time to construct  107][108][109][110   two new  first of their kind  epr reactors under construction in finland and france have been delayed and are running over-budget  111][112][113  however learning from experience  two further epr reactors under construction in china are on  and ahead  of schedule respectively  114  as of 2013  according to the iaea and the european nuclear society  worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries  115][116  china has 29 of these nuclear power reactors under construction  as of 2013  with plans to build many more  116][117  while in the us the licenses of almost half its reactors have been extended to 60\xa0years  118  and plans to build another dozen are under serious consideration  119  there are also a considerable number of new reactors being built in south korea  india  and russia  at least 100 older and smaller reactors will  most probably be closed over the next 10\u201315 years   120  this is probable only if one does not factor in the ongoing light water reactor sustainability program  created to permit the extension of the life span of the usa s 104 nuclear reactors to 60 years  the licenses of almost half of the usa s reactors have been extended to 60\xa0years as of 2008.[118  two new  passive safety  ap1000 reactors are  as of 2013  being constructed at vogtle electric generating plant   public opinion about nuclear power varies widely between countries  121][122  a poll by gallup international (2011)[123  assessed public opinion in 47 countries  the poll was conducted following a tsunami and earthquake which caused an accident at the fukushima nuclear power plant in japan  49  stated that they held favourable views about nuclear energy  while 43  held an unfavourable view  124  another global survey by ipsos (2011)[125  assessed public opinion in 24 countries  respondents to this survey showed a clear preference for renewable energy sources over coal and nuclear energy  refer to graph opposite   2  ipsos (2012)[126  found that solar and wind were viewed by the public as being more environmentally friendly and more viable long-term energy sources relative to nuclear power and natural gas  however  solar and wind were viewed as being less reliable relative to nuclear power and natural gas  in 2012 a poll done in the uk found that 63  of those surveyed support nuclear power  and with opposition to nuclear power at 11%.[127  in germany  strong anti-nuclear sentiment led to eight of the seventeen operating reactors being permanently shut down following the march 2011 fukushima nuclear disaster  128   nuclear fusion research  in the form of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor is underway  fusion powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily achievable  as fission power had been  however  the extreme requirements for continuous reactions and plasma containment led to projections being extended by several decades  in 2010  more than 60 years after the first attempts  commercial power production was still believed to be unlikely before 2050.[129  although rather than an either  or  issue economical fusion-fission hybrid reactors could be built before any attempt at this more demanding commercial  pure-fusion reactor  demo reactor takes place  130   most mitigation proposals imply u2014rather than directly state u2014an eventual reduction in global fossil fuel production  also proposed are direct quotas on global fossil fuel production  131][132   natural gas emits far fewer greenhouse gases  i e  co2 and methane u2014ch4  than coal when burned at power plants  but evidence has been emerging that this benefit could be completely negated by methane leakage at gas drilling fields and other points in the supply chain   a study performed by the environmental protection agency  epa  and the gas research institute  gri  in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas  predominantly methane  use would be offset by a possible increased level of methane emissions from sources such as leaks and emissions  the study concluded that the reduction in emissions from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions  more recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged the findings of this study  with researchers from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa  reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (ch4  leakage from natural gas fields   a 2011 study 133  by noted climate research scientist  tom wigley  134  found that while carbon dioxide (co2  emissions from fossil fuel combustion may be reduced by using natural gas rather than coal to produce energy  it also found that additional methane (ch4  from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system  offsetting the reduction in co2 forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas  the study looked at methane leakage from coal mining  changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols  and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation  on balance  these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced co2 emissions  when gas replaces coal there is additional warming out to 2,050 with an assumed leakage rate of 0   and out to 2,140 if the leakage rate is as high as 10   the overall effects on global-mean temperature over the 21st century  however  are small  petron et al  (2013)[135  and alvarez et al  (2012)[136  note that estimated that leakage from gas infrastructure is likely to be underestimated  these studies indicate that the exploitation of natural gas as a  cleaner  fuel is questionable  a 2014 meta-study of 20 years of natural gas technical literature shows that methane emissions are consistently underestimated but on a 100-year scale  the climate benefits of coal to gas fuel switching are likely larger than the negative effects of natural gas leakage  137   a heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a  heat sink   heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one  a heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink   while air conditioners and freezers are familiar examples of heat pumps  the term  heat pump  is more general and applies to many hvac  heating  ventilating  and air conditioning  devices used for space heating or space cooling  when a heat pump is used for heating  it employs the same basic refrigeration-type cycle used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator  but in the opposite direction u2014releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment  in this use  heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground  138  in heating mode  heat pumps are three to four times more efficient in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters   it has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market  with a market share of 30  and  potentially  clean electricity  heat pumps could reduce global co2 emissions by 8  annually  139  using ground source heat pumps could reduce around 60  of the primary energy demand and 90  of co2 emissions in europe in 2050 and make handling high shares of renewable energy easier  140  using surplus renewable energy in heat pumps is regarded as the most effective household means to reduce global warming and fossil fuel depletion  141   with significant amounts of fossil fuel used in electricity production  demands on the electrical grid also generate greenhouse gases  without a high share of low-carbon electricity  a domestic heat pump will produce more carbon emissions than using natural gas  142   fossil fuel may be phased-out with carbon neutral and carbon negative pipeline and transportation fuels created with power to gas and gas to liquids technologies  143][144][145][146][147  carbon dioxide from fossil fuel flue gas can be used to produce plastic lumber allowing carbon negative reforestation  148   efficient energy use  sometimes simply called  energy efficiency   is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services  for example  insulating a home allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature  installing fluorescent lights or natural skylights reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional incandescent light bulbs  compact fluorescent lights use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than incandescent lights  150   energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing energy consumption  for example  the state of california began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s  including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements  during the following years  california s energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national u s  consumption doubled  as part of its strategy  california implemented a  loading order  for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first  renewable electricity supplies second  and new fossil-fired power plants last  151   energy conservation is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses using less energy to achieve a lesser energy demanding service  for example through behavioral change  as well as encompassing energy efficiency  examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter  driving less  or working in a less brightly lit room  as with other definitions  the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy  but both are important in environmental and economic terms  this is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels  152   reducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions  according to the international energy agency  improved energy efficiency in buildings  industrial processes and transportation could reduce the world s energy needs in 2050 by one third  and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases  153   fuel switching on the demand side refers to changing the type of fuel used to satisfy a need for an energy service  to meet deep decarbonization goals  like the 80  reduction by 2050 goal being discussed in california and the european union  many primary energy changes are needed  154][155  energy efficiency alone may not be sufficient to meet these goals  switching fuels used on the demand side will help lower carbon emissions  156][157  progressively coal  oil and eventually natural gas for space and water heating in buildings will need to be reduced  for an equivalent amount of heat  burning natural gas produces about 45 per cent less carbon dioxide than burning coal  158  there are various ways in which this could happen  and different strategies will likely make sense in different locations  while the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat  the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric heat pump has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates  this is possible because of the very efficient coefficient of performance of heat pumps   at the beginning of this century 70  of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels  and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix  replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit  in areas like norway  brazil and quebec that have abundant hydroelectricity  electric heat and hot water is common   the economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating  will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment  the eia annual energy outlook 2014 suggests that domestic gas prices will rise faster than electricity prices which will encourage electrification in the coming decades  159  electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in demand response  since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage  electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid   alternatives to electrification  include decarbonizing pipeline gas through power to gas  biogas  or other carbon neutral fuels  a 2015 study by energy environmental economics shows that a hybrid approach of decarbonizing pipeline gas  electrification  and energy efficiency can meet carbon reduction goals at a similar cost as only electrification and energy efficiency in southern california  160   expanding intermittent electrical sources such as wind power  creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations  some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental super grids costing billions of dollars  however instead of building for more power there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side  designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittentcy  power failures and peak demands  having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a smart grid   time of use metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption  for instance  running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed  reduces electricity costs   dynamic demand plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid  this method may work very well with thermostats  when power on the grid sags a small amount  a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid  for instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations  consumers would need to have a smart meter in order for the utility to calculate credits   demand response devices could receive all sorts of messages from the grid  the message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand  to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid  or notifications about the current and expected prices for power  this would allow electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day  the vehicle-to-grid suggestion would use a car s battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily   the ipcc fifth assessment report emphasises that behaviour  lifestyle and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors  particularly when complementing technological and structural change  161]:20 in general  higher consumption lifestyles have a greater environmental impact  overall  food accounts for the largest share of consumption-based ghg emissions with nearly 20  of the global carbon footprint  followed by housing  mobility  services  manufactured products  and construction  food and services are more significant in poor countries  while mobility and manufactured goods are more significant in rich countries  162]:327  a 2014 study into the real-life diets of british people estimates their greenhouse gas contributions (co2eq  to be  7.19\xa0kg day for high meat-eaters through to 3.81\xa0kg day for vegetarians and 2.89\xa0kg day for vegans  163  the widespread adoption of a vegetarian diet could cut food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 63  by 2050.[164  china introduced new dietary guidelines in 2016 which aim to cut meat consumption by 50  and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 1\xa0billion tonnes by 2030.[165  a 2016 study concluded that taxes on meat and milk could simultaneously result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions and healthier diets  the study analyzed surcharges of 40  on beef and 20  on milk and suggests that an optimum plan would reduce emissions by 1\xa0billion tonnes per year  166][167   a carbon sink is a natural or artificial reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period  such as a growing forest  a negative carbon dioxide emission on the other hand is a permanent removal of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere  such as directly capturing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and storing it in geologic formations underground   the antarctic climate and ecosystems cooperative research centre  ace-crc  notes that one third of humankind u2019s annual emissions of co2 are absorbed by the oceans  168  however  this also leads to ocean acidification  with potentially significant impacts on marine life  169  acidification lowers the level of carbonate ions available for calcifying organisms to form their shells  these organisms include plankton species that contribute to the foundation of the southern ocean food web  however acidification may impact on a broad range of other physiological and ecological processes  such as fish respiration  larval development and changes in the solubility of both nutrients and toxins  170   almost 20 percent (8\xa0gtco2 year  of total greenhouse-gas emissions were from

indigenous inhabitants is argued to be a cost effective strategy to conserve forests  172  this includes the protection of such rights entitled in existing laws  such as india u2019s forest rights act  172  the transferring of such rights in china  perhaps the largest land reform in modern times  has been argued to have increased forest cover  173  in brazil  forested areas given tenure to indigenous groups have even lower rates of clearing than national parks  173  a 2016 report concludes that modest investments in indigenous land rights will generate economic  social  and environmental returns for the communities involved and for climate protection  the report quantifies the economic value of securing such rights  with a focus on the amazon region  174][175   with increased intensive agriculture and urbanization  there is an increase in the amount of abandoned farmland  by some estimates  for every half a hectare of original old-growth forest cut down  more than 20 hectares of new secondary forests are growing  even though they do not have the same biodiversity as the original forests and original forests store 60  more carbon than these new secondary forests  176][177  according to a study in science  promoting regrowth on abandoned farmland could offset years of carbon emissions  178   restoring grasslands store co2 from the air into plant material  grazing livestock  usually not left to wander  would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth  however  grass left alone would eventually grow to cover its own growing buds  preventing them from photosynthesizing and the dying plant would stay in place  180  a method proposed to restore grasslands uses fences with many small paddocks and moving herds from one paddock to another after a day a two in order to mimick natural grazers and allowing the grass to grow optimally  180][181][182  additionally  when part of leaf matter is consumed by a herding animal  a corresponding amount of root matter is sloughed off too as it would not be able to sustain the previous amount of root matter and while most of the lost root matter would rot and enter the atmosphere  part of the carbon is sequestered into the soil  180  it is estimated that increasing the carbon content of the soils in the world u2019s 3.5 billion hectares of agricultural grassland by 1  would offset nearly 12 years of co2 emissions  180  allan savory  as part of holistic management  claims that while large herds are often blamed for desertification  prehistoric lands supported large or larger herds and areas where herds were removed in the united states are still desertifying  179   carbon capture and storage  ccs  is a method to mitigate climate change by capturing carbon dioxide (co2  from large point sources such as power plants and subsequently storing it away safely instead of releasing it into the atmosphere  the intergovernmental panel on climate change says ccs could contribute between 10  and 55  of the cumulative worldwide carbon-mitigation effort over the next 90 years  the international energy agency says ccs is  the most important single new technology for co2 savings  in power generation and industry  183  though it requires up to 40  more energy to run a ccs coal power plant than a regular coal plant  ccs could potentially capture about 90  of all the carbon emitted by the plant  183  norway  which first began storing co2  has cut its emissions by almost a million tons a year  or about 3  of the country s 1990 levels  183  as of late 2011  the total co2 storage capacity of all 14 projects in operation or under construction is over 33 million tonnes a year  this is broadly equivalent to preventing the emissions from more than six million cars from entering the atmosphere each year  184   creating negative carbon dioxide emissions literally removes carbon from the atmosphere  examples are direct air capture  biochar  bio-energy with carbon capture and storage and enhanced weathering technologies  these processes are sometimes considered as variations of sinks or mitigation  185][186  and sometimes as geoengineering  187   in combination with other mitigation measures  sinks in combination with negative carbon emissions are considered crucial for meeting the 350 ppm target  188][189  and even the less conservative 450 ppm target  190   geoengineering is seen by some who   as an alternative to mitigation and adaptation  but by others who   as an entirely separate response to climate change  in a literature assessment  barker et al  (2007  described geoengineering as a type of mitigation policy  191  ipcc (2007  concluded that geoengineering options  such as ocean fertilization to remove co2 from the atmosphere  remained largely unproven  192  it was judged that reliable cost estimates for geoengineering had not yet been published   chapter 28 of the national academy of sciences report policy implications of greenhouse warming  mitigation  adaptation  and the science base (1992  defined geoengineering as  options that would involve large-scale engineering of our environment in order to combat or counteract the effects of changes in atmospheric chemistry   193  they evaluated a range of options to try to give preliminary answers to two questions  can these options work and could they be carried out with a reasonable cost  they also sought to encourage discussion of a third question xa0\u2014 what adverse side effects might there be  the following types of option were examined  reforestation  increasing ocean absorption of carbon dioxide  carbon sequestration  and screening out some sunlight  nas also argued  engineered countermeasures need to be evaluated but should not be implemented without broad understanding of the direct effects and the potential side effects  the ethical issues  and the risks    193  in july 2011 a report by the united states government accountability office on geoengineering found that   c limate engineering technologies do not now offer a viable response to global climate change   194   carbon dioxide removal has been proposed as a method of reducing the amount of radiative forcing  a variety of means of artificially capturing and storing carbon  as well as of enhancing natural sequestration processes  are being explored  the main natural process is photosynthesis by plants and single-celled organisms  see biosequestration   artificial processes vary  and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of some of these processes  195   it is notable that the availability of cheap energy and appropriate sites for geological storage of carbon may make carbon dioxide air capture viable commercially  it is  however  generally expected that carbon dioxide air capture may be uneconomic when compared to carbon capture and storage from major sources xa0\u2014 in particular  fossil fuel powered power stations  refineries  etc  in such cases  costs of energy produced will grow significantly  citation needed  however  captured co2 can be used to force more crude oil out of oil fields  as statoil and shell have made plans to do  196  co2 can also be used in commercial greenhouses  giving an opportunity to kick-start the technology  some attempts have been made to use algae to capture smokestack emissions  197  notably the greenfuel technologies corporation  who have now shut down operations  198   the main purpose of solar radiation management seek to reflect sunlight and thus reduce global warming  the ability of stratospheric sulfate aerosols to create a global dimming effect has made them a possible candidate for use in climate engineering projects  199   co2 is not the only ghg relevant to mitigation  200  and governments have acted to regulate the emissions of other ghgs emitted by human activities  anthropogenic ghgs   the emissions caps agreed to by most developed countries under the kyoto protocol regulate the emissions of almost all the anthropogenic ghgs  201  these gases are co2  methane (ch4   nitrous oxide (n2o   the hydrofluorocarbons  hfc   perfluorocarbons  pfc   and sulfur hexafluoride (sf6    stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations of the different anthropogenic ghgs requires an understanding of their different physical properties  stabilization depends both on how quickly ghgs are added to the atmosphere and how fast they are removed  the rate of removal is measured by the atmospheric lifetime of the ghg in question  see the main ghg article for a list   here  the lifetime is defined as the time required for a given perturbation of the ghg in the atmosphere to be reduced to 37  of its initial amount  19  methane has a relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 12 years  while n2o s lifetime is about 110 years  for methane  a reduction of about 30  below current emission levels would lead to a stabilization in its atmospheric concentration  while for n2o  an emissions reduction of more than 50  would be required  19   methane is a significantly more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide in the amount of heat it can trap  especially in the short term  202  burning one molecule of methane generates one molecule of carbon dioxide  indicating there may be no net benefit in using gas as a fuel source  133][135  reducing the amount of waste methane produced in the first place and moving away from use of gas as a fuel source will have a greater beneficial impact  as might other approaches to productive use of otherwise-wasted methane  in terms of prevention  vaccines are being developed in australia to reduce the significant global warming contributions from methane released by livestock via flatulence and eructation  203   another physical property of the anthropogenic ghgs relevant to mitigation is the different abilities of the gases to trap heat  in the form of infrared radiation   some gases are more effective at trapping heat than others  e g   sf6 is 22,200 times more effective a ghg than co2 on a per-kilogram basis  204  a measure for this physical property is the global warming potential  gwp   and is used in the kyoto protocol  205   although not designed for this purpose  the montreal protocol has probably benefited climate change mitigation efforts  206  the montreal protocol is an international treaty that has successfully reduced emissions of ozone-depleting substances  for example  cfcs   which are also greenhouse gases   transportation emissions account for roughly 1/4 of emissions worldwide  and are even more important in terms of impact in developed nations especially in north america and australia  many citizens of countries like the united states and canada who drive personal cars often  see well over half of their climate change impact stemming from the emissions produced from their cars  modes of mass transportation such as bus  light rail  metro  subway  etc    and long-distance rail are far and away the most energy-efficient means of motorized transportation for passengers  able to use in many cases over twenty times less energy per person-distance than a personal automobile  modern energy-efficient technologies  such as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and carbon-neutral synthetic gasoline  amp  jet fuel may also help to reduce the consumption of petroleum  land use changes and emissions of carbon dioxide  utilizing rail transport  especially electric rail  over the far less efficient air transport and truck transport significantly reduces emissions  208][209  with the use of electric trains and cars in transportation there is the opportunity to run them with low-carbon power  producing far fewer emissions   effective urban planning to reduce sprawl aims to decrease vehicle miles travelled  vmt   lowering emissions from transportation  personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers  while public transport and bicycles are many times more efficient  as is the simplest form of human transportation  walking   all of these are encouraged by urban community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  between 1982 and 1997  the amount of land consumed for urban development in the united states increased by 47 percent while the nation s population grew by only 17 percent  210  inefficient land use development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation  community services  and buildings   at the same time  a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning  these smart growth practices include compact community development  multiple transportation choices  mixed land uses  and practices to conserve green space  these programs offer environmental  economic  and quality-of-life benefits  and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions   approaches such as new urbanism and transit-oriented development seek to reduce distances travelled  especially by private vehicles  encourage public transit and make walking and cycling more attractive options  this is achieved through  medium-density   mixed-use planning and the concentration of housing within walking distance of town centers and transport nodes   smarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior  for example  transportation energy usage  the number one user of petroleum fuels  could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns  which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices   emissions from housing are substantial  211  and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference  212   for institutions of higher learning in the united states  greenhouse gas emissions depend primarily on total area of buildings and secondarily on climate  213  if climate is not taken into account  annual greenhouse gas emissions due to energy consumed on campuses plus purchased electricity can be estimated with the formula  e asb  where a =0.001621 metric tonnes of co2 equivalent square foot or 0.0241 metric tonnes of co2 equivalent square meter and b   1.1354.[214   new buildings can be constructed using passive solar building design  low-energy building  or zero-energy building techniques  using renewable heat sources  existing buildings can be made more efficient through the use of insulation  high-efficiency appliances  particularly hot water heaters and furnaces   double- or triple-glazed gas-filled windows  external window shades  and building orientation and siting  renewable heat sources such as shallow geothermal and passive solar energy reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted  in addition to designing buildings which are more energy-efficient to heat  it is possible to design buildings that are more energy-efficient to cool by using lighter-coloured  more reflective materials in the development of urban areas  e g  by painting roofs white  and planting trees  215][216  this saves energy because it cools buildings and reduces the urban heat island effect thus reducing the use of air conditioning   according to the epa  agricultural soil management practices can lead to production and emission of nitrous oxide (n2o   a major greenhouse gas and air pollutant  activities that can contribute to n n2o emissions include fertilizer usage  irrigation and tillage  the management of soils accounts for over half of the emissions from the agriculture sector  cattle livestocks account for one third of emissions  through methane emissions  manure management and rice cultivation also produce gaseous emissions  217   methods that significantly enhance carbon sequestration in soil include no-till farming  residue mulching  cover cropping  and crop rotation  all of which are more widely used in organic farming than in conventional farming  218][219  because only 5  of us farmland currently uses no-till and residue mulching  there is a large potential for carbon sequestration  220   a 2015 study found that farming can deplete soil carbon and render soil incapable of supporting life  instead the study showed that conservation farming can protect carbon in soils  and repair damage over time  221   the farming practise of cover crops has been recognized as climate-smart agriculture by the white house  222   another method being examined is to make carbon a new currency by introducing tradeable  personal carbon credits   the idea being it will encourage and motivate individuals to reduce their  carbon footprint  by the way they live  each citizen will receive a free annual quota of carbon that they can use to travel  buy food  and go about their business  it has been suggested that by using this concept it could actually solve two problems  pollution and poverty  old age pensioners will actually be better off because they fly less often  so they can cash in their quota at the end of the year to pay heating bills and so forth  citation needed   various organizations promote population control as a means for mitigating global warming  223][224][225][226][227  proposed measures include improving access to family planning and reproductive health care and information  reducing natalistic politics  public education about the consequences of continued population growth  and improving access of women to education and economic opportunities   population control efforts are impeded by there being somewhat of a taboo in some countries against considering any such efforts  228  also  various religions discourage or prohibit some or all forms of birth control   population size has a different per capita effect on global warming in different countries  since the per capita production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases varies greatly by country  229   the stern review proposes stabilising the concentration of greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere at a maximum of 550ppm co2e by 2050  the review estimates that this would mean cutting total greenhouse-gas emissions to three quarters of 2007 levels  the review further estimates that the cost of these cuts would be in the range \u22121.0 to +3.5  of world gdp   i e  gwp   with an average estimate of approximately 1%.[171  stern has since revised his estimate to 2  of gwp  230  for comparison  the gross world product  gwp  at ppp was estimated at $74.5 trillion in 2010,[231  thus 2  is approximately $1.5 trillion  the review emphasises that these costs are contingent on steady reductions in the cost of low-carbon technologies  mitigation costs will also vary according to how and when emissions are cut  early  well-planned action will minimise the costs  171   one way of estimating the cost of reducing emissions is by considering the likely costs of potential technological and output changes  policy makers can compare the marginal abatement costs of different methods to assess the cost and amount of possible abatement over time  the marginal abatement costs of the various measures will differ by country  by sector  and over time  171   yohe et al  (2007  assessed the literature on sustainability and climate change  232  with high confidence  they suggested that up to the year 2050  an effort to cap greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions at 550\xa0ppm would benefit developing countries significantly  this was judged to be especially the case when combined with enhanced adaptation  by 2100  however  it was still judged likely that there would be significant effects of global warming  this was judged to be the case even with aggressive mitigation and significantly enhanced adaptive capacity   one of the aspects of mitigation is how to share the costs and benefits of mitigation policies  there is no scientific consensus over how to share these costs and benefits  toth et al   2001).[233  in terms of the politics of mitigation  the unfccc s ultimate objective is to stabilize concentrations of ghg in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent  dangerous  climate change  rogner et al   2007).[234   ghg emissions are an important correlate of wealth  at least at present  banuri et al   1996  pp  xa091\u201392).[235  wealth  as measured by per capita income  i e   income per head of population   varies widely between different countries  activities of the poor that involve emissions of ghgs are often associated with basic needs  such as heating to stay tolerably warm  in richer countries  emissions tend to be associated with things like cars  central heating  etc  the impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human welfare according to wealth   there have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions  banuri et al   1996  pp  xa0103\u2013105):[235   many countries  both developing and developed  are aiming to use cleaner technologies  world bank  2010  p  xa0192).[238  use of these technologies aids mitigation and could result in substantial reductions in co2 emissions  policies include targets for emissions reductions  increased use of renewable energy  and increased energy efficiency  it is often argued that the results of climate change are more damaging in poor nations  where infrastructures are weak and few social services exist  the commitment to development index is one attempt to analyze rich country policies taken to reduce their disproportionate use of the global commons  countries do well if their greenhouse gas emissions are falling  if their gas taxes are high  if they do not subsidize the fishing industry  if they have a low fossil fuel rate per capita  and if they control imports of illegally cut tropical timber   the main current international agreement on combating climate change is the kyoto protocol  which came into force on 16 february 2005  the kyoto protocol is an amendment to the united nations framework convention on climate change  unfccc   countries that have ratified this protocol have committed to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases  or engage in emissions trading if they maintain or increase emissions of these gases   actions to mitigate climate change are sometimes based on the goal of achieving a particular temperature target  one of the targets that has been suggested is to limit the future increase in global mean temperature  global warming  to below 2\xa0\xb0c  relative to the pre-industrial level  240][241  the 2\xa0\xb0c target was adopted in 2010 by parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change  242  most countries of the world are parties to the unfccc  243  the target had been adopted in 1996 by the european union council  244   temperatures have increased by 0.8\xa0\xb0c compared to the pre-industrial level  and another 0.5\u20130.7\xa0\xb0c is already committed  245  the 2\xa0\xb0c rise is typically associated in climate models with a carbon dioxide equivalent concentration of 400\u2013500 ppm by volume  the current  january 2015  level of carbon dioxide alone is 400 ppm by volume  and rising at 1\u20133 ppm annually  hence  to avoid a very likely breach of the 2\xa0\xb0c target  co2 levels would have to be stabilised very soon  this is generally regarded as unlikely  based on current programs in place to date  246][247  the importance of change is illustrated by the fact that world economic energy efficiency is improving at only half the rate of world economic growth  248   there is disagreement among experts over whether or not the 2\xa0\xb0c target can be met  249][250  for example  according to anderson and bows (2011),[251   there is little to no chance  of meeting the target  on the other hand  according to alcamo et al  (2013):[252   scientific analysis can provide information on the impacts of climate change and associated policies  such as reducing ghg emissions  however  deciding what policies are best requires value judgements  12  for example  limiting global warming to 1\xa0\xb0c relative to pre-industrial levels may help to reduce climate change damages more than a 2\xa0\xb0c limit  254  however  a 1\xa0\xb0c limit may be more costly to achieve than a 2\xa0\xb0c limit  255   according to some analysts  the 2\xa0\xb0c  guardrail  is inadequate for the needed degree and timeliness of mitigation  16  on the other hand  some economic studies suggest more modest mitigation policies  17  for example  the emissions reductions proposed by nordhaus (2010)[18  might lead to global warming  in the year 2100  of around 3\xa0\xb0c  relative to pre-industrial levels   in 2015  two official unfccc scientific expert bodies came to the conclusion that   in some regions and vulnerable ecosystems  high risks are projected even for warming above 1.5\xb0c   256  this expert position was  together with the strong diplomatic voice of the poorest countries and the island nations in the pacific  the driving force leading to the decision of the paris conference 2015  to lay down this 1.5\xa0\xb0c long-term target on top of the existing 2\xa0\xb0c goal  257   an emissions tax on greenhouse gas emissions requires individual emitters to pay a fee  charge or tax for every tonne of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere  258  most environmentally related taxes with implications for greenhouse gas emissions in oecd countries are levied on energy products and motor vehicles  rather than on co2 emissions directly  258   emission taxes can be both cost-effective and environmentally effective  258  difficulties with emission taxes include their potential unpopularity  and the fact that they cannot guarantee a particular level of emissions reduction  258  emissions or energy taxes also often fall disproportionately on lower income classes  in developing countries  institutions may be insufficiently developed for the collection of emissions fees from a wide variety of sources  258   according to mark z  jacobson  a program of subsidization balanced against expected flood costs could pay for conversion to 100  renewable power by 2030.[259  jacobson  and his colleague mark delucchi  suggest that the cost to generate and transmit power in 2020 will be less than 4 cents per kilowatt hour  in 2007 dollars  for wind  about 4 cents for wave and hydroelectric  from 4 to 7 cents for geothermal  and 8 cents per kwh for solar  fossil  and nuclear power  260   another indirect method of encouraging uses of renewable energy  and pursue sustainability and environmental protection  is that of prompting investment in this area through legal means  something that is already being done at national level as well as in the field of international investment  261   with the creation of a market for trading carbon dioxide emissions within the kyoto protocol  it is likely that london financial markets will be the centre for this potentially highly lucrative business  the new york and chicago stock markets may have a lower trade volume than expected as long as the us maintains its rejection of the kyoto  262   however  emissions trading may delay the phase-out of fossil fuels  263   in the north-east united states  a successful cap and trade program has shown potential for this solution  264   the european union emission trading scheme  eu ets  265  is the largest multi-national  greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme in the world  it commenced operation on 1 january 2005  and all 28 member states of the european union participate in the scheme which has created a new market in carbon dioxide allowances estimated at 35\xa0billion euros (us 43\xa0billion  per year  266  the chicago climate exchange was the first  voluntary  emissions market  and is soon to be followed by asia s first market  asia carbon exchange   a total of 107 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent have been exchanged

change and claiming that market-based solutions can help  it called on governments to establish  clear  transparent  and consistent price signals  through  creation of a long-term policy framework  that would include all major producers of greenhouse gases   the regional greenhouse gas initiative is a proposed carbon trading scheme being created by nine north-eastern and mid-atlantic american states  connecticut  delaware  maine  massachusetts  new hampshire  new jersey  new york  rhode island and vermont  the scheme was due to be developed by april 2005 but has not yet been completed   implementation puts into effect climate change mitigation strategies and targets  these can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions  this is the most important  expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance  269   implementation requires funding sources but is often beset by disputes over who should provide funds and under what conditions  269  a lack of funding can be a barrier to successful strategies as there are no formal arrangements to finance climate change development and implementation  270  funding is often provided by nations  groups of nations and increasingly ngo and private sources  these funds are often channelled through the global environmental facility  gef   this is an environmental funding mechanism in the world bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues  269  the gef was originally designed to tackle four main areas  biological diversity  climate change  international waters and ozone layer depletion  to which land degradation and persistent organic pollutant were added  the gef funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the gef u2019s implementing agencies  271   there are numerous issues which result in a current perceived lack of implementation  269  it has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are  uncertainty  fragmentation  institutional void  short time horizon of policies and politicians and missing motives and willingness to start adapting  the relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation  when information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed  context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier  institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place  calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes  the short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues  statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made  missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation  270   the issues that arise with a system which involves international government cooperation  such as cap and trade  could potentially be improved with a polycentric approach where the rules are enforced by many small sections of authority as apposed to one overall enforcement agency  272   despite a perceived lack of occurrence  evidence of implementation is emerging internationally  some examples of this are the initiation of napa u2019s and of joint implementation  many developing nations have made national adaptation programs of action  napas  which are frameworks to prioritize adaption needs  273  the implementation of many of these is supported by gef agencies  274  many developed countries are implementing \u2018first generation u2019 institutional adaption plans particularly at the state and local government scale  273  there has also been a push towards joint implementation between countries by the unfcc as this has been suggested as a cost-effective way for objectives to be achieved  275   efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the united states include energy policies which encourage efficiency through programs like energy star  commercial building integration  and the industrial technologies program  276  on 12 november 1998  vice president al gore symbolically signed the kyoto protocol  but he indicated participation by the developing nations was necessary prior its being submitted for ratification by the united states senate  277   in 2007  transportation secretary mary peters  with white house approval  urged governors and dozens of members of the house of representatives to block california u2019s first-in-the-nation limits on greenhouse gases from cars and trucks  according to e-mails obtained by congress  278  the u s  climate change science program is a group of about twenty federal agencies and us cabinet departments  all working together to address global warming   the bush administration pressured american scientists to suppress discussion of global warming  according to the testimony of the union of concerned scientists to the oversight and government reform committee of the u s  house of representatives  279][280   high-quality science  was  struggling to get out   as the bush administration pressured scientists to tailor their writings on global warming to fit the bush administration s skepticism  in some cases at the behest of an ex-oil industry lobbyist   nearly half of all respondents perceived or personally experienced pressure to eliminate the words  climate change    global warming  or other similar terms from a variety of communications   similarly  according to the testimony of senior officers of the government accountability project  the white house attempted to bury the report  national assessment of the potential consequences of climate variability and change   produced by u s  scientists pursuant to u s  law  281  some u s  scientists resigned their jobs rather than give in to white house pressure to underreport global warming  279   in the absence of substantial federal action  state governments have adopted emissions-control laws such as the regional greenhouse gas initiative in the northeast and the global warming solutions act of 2006 in california  282   in order to reconcile economic development with mitigating carbon emissions  developing countries need particular support  both financial and technical  one of the means of achieving this is the kyoto protocol s clean development mechanism  cdm   the world bank s prototype carbon fund 283  is a public private partnership that operates within the cdm   an important point of contention  however  is how overseas development assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation  284  one of the outcomes of the unfcc copenhagen climate conference was the copenhagen accord  in which developed countries promised to provide us $30\xa0million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources  284  yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the european commission has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional  and researchers at the overseas development institute have found four main understandings  284   the main point being that there is a conflict between the oecd states budget deficit cuts  the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important millennium development goals  284   however  none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries  this is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions  critics who   of mitigation often argue that  the developing countries  drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming  critics who   also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet   in an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies  unep and wto urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the doha trade round  which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services   285   while many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding  legislation and regulatory action  individuals and businesses can also play a part in the mitigation effort   environmental groups encourage individual action against global warming  often aimed at the consumer  common recommendations include lowering home heating and cooling usage  burning less gasoline  supporting renewable energy sources  buying local products to reduce transportation  turning off unused devices  and various others   a geophysicist at utrecht university has urged similar institutions to hold the vanguard in voluntary mitigation  suggesting the use of communications technologies such as videoconferencing to reduce their dependence on long-haul flights  286   in 2008  climate scientist kevin anderson raised concern about the growing effect of rapidly increasing global air transport on the climate in a paper  287  and a presentation  288  suggesting that reversing this trend is necessary to reduce emissions   part of the difficulty is that when aviation emissions are made at high altitude  the climate impacts are much greater than otherwise  others have been raising the related concerns of the increasing hypermobility of individuals  whether traveling for business or pleasure  involving frequent and often long distance air travel  as well as air shipment of goods  289   on 9 may 2005 jeff immelt  the chief executive of general electric  ge   announced plans to reduce ge s global warming related emissions by one percent by 2012   ge said that given its projected growth  those emissions would have risen by 40 percent without such action   290   on 21 june 2005 a group of leading airlines  airports and aerospace manufacturers pledged to work together to reduce the negative environmental impact of aviation  including limiting the impact of air travel on climate change by improving fuel efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions of new aircraft by fifty percent per seat kilometre by 2020 from 2000 levels  the group aims to develop a common reporting system for carbon dioxide emissions per aircraft by the end of 2005  and pressed for the early inclusion of aviation in the european union s carbon emission trading scheme  291   climate change is also a concern for large institutional investors who have a long term time horizon and potentially large exposure to the negative impacts of global warming because of the large geographic footprint of their multi-national holdings  sri  socially responsible investing  funds allow investors to invest in funds that meet high esg  environmental  social  governance  standards as such funds invest in companies that are aligned with these goals  292  proxy firms can be used to draft guidelines for investment managers that take these concerns into account  293   in some countries  those affected by climate change may be able to sue major producers  attempts at litigation have been initiated by entire peoples such as palau 294  and the inuit  295  as well as non-governmental organizations such as the sierra club  296  although proving that particular weather events are due specifically to global warming may never be possible  297  methodologies have been developed to show the increased risk of such events caused by global warming  298   for a legal action for negligence  or similar  to succeed   plaintiffs     must show that  more probably than not  their individual injuries were caused by the risk factor in question  as opposed to any other cause  this has sometimes been translated to a requirement of a relative risk of at least two   299  another route  though with little legal bite  is the world heritage convention  if it can be shown that climate change is affecting world heritage sites like mount everest  300][301   besides countries suing one another  there are also cases where people in a country have taken legal steps against their own government  legal action for instance has been taken to try to force the u s  environmental protection agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act  302  and against the export-import bank and opic for failing to assess environmental impacts  including global warming impacts  under nepa  citation needed   in the netherlands and belgium  organisations as urgenda 303][304][305  and the vzw klimaatzaak in belgium 306][307  have also sued their governments as they believe their governments aren t meeting the emission reductions they agreed to  urgenda has all ready won their case against the dutch government   according to a 2004 study commissioned by friends of the earth  exxonmobil and its predecessors caused 4.7 to 5.3 percent of the world s man-made carbon dioxide emissions between 1882 and 2002  the group suggested that such studies could form the basis for eventual legal action  308   in 2015  exxon  received a subpoena  according to the washington post and confirmed by the company  the attorney general of new york  eric schneiderman  opened an investigation into the possibility that the company had mislead the public and investors about the risks of climate change  309
