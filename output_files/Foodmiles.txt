Foodmiles
 food miles is a term which refers to the distance food is transported from the time of its production until it reaches the consumer  food miles are one factor used when assessing the environmental impact of food  including the impact on global warming  1   the concept of food miles originated in the early 1990s in the united kingdom  it was conceived by professor tim lang 2  at the sustainable agriculture food and environment  safe  alliance 3  and first appeared in print in a report \u201cthe food miles report  the dangers of long-distance food transport u201d  researched and written by angela paxton  4][5   some scholars believe that an increase in the distance food travels is due to the globalization of trade  the focus of food supply bases into fewer  larger districts  drastic changes in delivery patterns  the increase in processed and packaged foods  and making fewer trips to the supermarket  at the same time  most of the greenhouse gas emissions created by food have their origin in the production phases  which create 83  of overall emissions of co2.[6   a range of studies compare emissions over the entire food cycle  including production  consumption  and transport  7  these include estimates of food-related emissions of greenhouse gas  up to the farm gate  versus  beyond the farm gate   in the uk  for example  agricultural-related emissions may account for approximately 40  of the overall food chain  including retail  packaging  fertilizer manufacture  and other factors   whereas greenhouse gases emitted in transport account for around 12  of overall food-chain emissions  8  the goal of environmental protection agencies is to make people aware of the environmental impact of food miles and to show the pollution percentage and the energy used to transport food over long distances  citation needed    researchers are currently working to provide the public with more information   the concept of  food miles  has been criticised  and food miles are not always correlated with the actual environmental impact of food production       the concept of food miles is part of the broader issue of sustainability which deals with a large range of environmental  social and economic issues  including local food  the term was coined by tim lang  now professor of food policy  city university  london  who says   the point was to highlight the hidden ecological  social and economic consequences of food production to consumers in a simple way  one which had objective reality but also connotations   9  food that is transported by road produces more carbon emissions than any other form of transported food  road transport produces 60  of the world s food transport carbon emissions  air transport produces 20  of the world s food transport carbon emissions  rail and sea transport produce 10  each of the world s food transport carbon emissions   although it was never intended as a complete measure of environmental impact  it has come under attack as an ineffective means of finding the true environmental impact  for example  a defra report in 2005 undertaken by researchers at aea technology environment  entitled the validity of food miles as an indicator of sustainable development  included findings that  the direct environmental  social and economic costs of food transport are over \xa39 billion each year  and are dominated by congestion   10  the report also indicates that it is not only how far the food has travelled but the method of travel in all parts of the food chain that is important to consider  many trips by personal cars to shopping centres would have a negative environmental impact compared to transporting a few truckloads to neighbourhood stores that can be easily reached by walking or cycling  more emissions are created by the drive to the supermarket to buy air freighted food than was created by the air freighting in the first place  11  also  the positive environmental effects of organic farming may be compromised by increased transportation  unless it is produced by local farms  the carbon trust notes that to understand the carbon emissions from food production  all the carbon-emitting processes that occur as a result of getting food from the field to our plates need to be considered  including production  origin  seasonality and home care  12   a recent study led by professor miguel gomez  applied economics and management   at cornell university and supported by the atkinson center for a sustainable future found that in many instances  the supermarket supply chain did much better in terms of food miles and fuel consumption for each pound compared to farmers markets  it suggests that selling local foods through supermarkets may be more economically viable and sustainable than through farmers markets  13   with processed foods that are made of many different ingredients  it is very complicated  though not impossible  to calculate the co2 emissions from transport by multiplying the distance travelled of each ingredient  by the carbon intensity of the mode of transport  air  road or rail   however  as both prof  lang and the original food miles report noted  the resulting number \u2013 although interesting  cannot give the whole picture of how sustainable \u2013 or not \u2013 a food product is  4   according to oxfam researchers  there are many other aspects of the agricultural processing and the food supply chain that also contribute to greenhouse gas emissions which are not taken into account by simple  food miles  measurements  14][15  there are benefits to be gained by improving livelihoods in poor countries through agricultural development  smallholder farmers in poor countries can often improve their income and standard of living if they can sell to distant export markets for higher value horticultural produce  moving away from the subsistence agriculture of producing staple crops for their own consumption or local markets  16   however  exports from poor countries do not always benefit poor people  unless the product has a fairtrade label  or a label from another robust and independent scheme  food exports might make a bad situation worse  citation needed  for example  wages are often very low and working conditions bad and sometimes dangerous  sometimes the food grown for export takes up land that had been used to grow food for local consumption  so local people can go hungry  17   researchers say a more complete environmental assessment of food that consumers buy needs to take into account how the food has been produced and what energy is used in its production  a recent defra case study indicated that tomatoes grown in spain and transported to the united kingdom may have a lower carbon footprint in terms of energy efficiency than tomatoes grown in heated greenhouses in the united kingdom  18   according to german researchers  the food miles concept misleads consumers because the size of transportation and production units is not taken into account  using the methodology of life cycle assessment  lca  in accordance with iso 14040  entire supply chains providing german consumers with food were investigated  comparing local food with food of european and global provenance  large-scale agriculture reduces unit costs associated with food production and transportation  leading to increased efficiency and decreased energy use per kilogram of food by economies of scale  research from the justus liebig university giessen show that small food production operations may cause even more environmental impact than bigger operations in terms of energy use per kilogram  even though food miles are lower  case studies of lamb  beef  wine  apples  fruit juices and pork show that the concept of food miles is too simple to account for all factors of food production  19][20][21   a 2006 research report from the agribusiness and economics research unit at lincoln university  new zealand counters claims about food miles by comparing total energy used in food production in europe and new zealand  taking into account energy used to ship the food to europe for consumers  22][23  the report states   new zealand has greater production efficiency in many food commodities compared to the uk  for example new zealand agriculture tends to apply fewer fertilizers  which require large amounts of energy to produce and cause significant co2 emissions  and animals are able to graze year round outside eating grass instead of large quantities of brought-in feed such as concentrates  in the case of dairy and sheep meat production nz is by far more energy efficient  even including the transport cost  than the uk  twice as efficient in the case of dairy  and four times as efficient in case of sheep meat  11  in the case of apples  nz is more energy-efficient even though the energy embodied in capital items and other inputs data was not available for the uk    other researchers have contested the claims from new zealand  professor gareth edwards-jones has said that the arguments \u201cin favour of new zealand apples shipped to the uk is probably true only or about two months a year  during july and august  when the carbon footprint for locally grown fruit doubles because it comes out of cool stores  u201d 24   studies by dr  christopher weber et al  of the total carbon footprint of food production in the u s  have shown transportation to be of minor importance  compared to the carbon emissions resulting from pesticide and fertilizer production  and the fuel required by farm and food processing equipment  25   farm animals account for between 20  and 30  of global greenhouse gas emissions  26][27  that figure includes the clearing of land to feed and graze the animals  clearing land of trees  and cultivation  are the main drivers of farming emissions  deforestation eliminates carbon sinks  accelerating the process of climate change  cultivation  including the use of synthetic fertilisers  releases greenhouse gases such as nitrous oxide  nitrogen fertiliser is especially demanding of fossil fuels  as producing a tonne of it takes 1.5 tonnes of oil  14   meanwhile  it u2019s increasingly recognised that meat and dairy are the largest sources of food-related emissions  the uk u2019s consumption of meat and dairy products  including imports  accounts for about 8  of national greenhouse gas emissions related to consumption  14   according to a study by engineers christopher weber and h  scott matthews of carnegie mellon university  of all the greenhouse gases emitted by the food industry  only 4  comes from transporting the food from producers to retailers  the study also concluded that adopting a vegetarian diet  even if the vegetarian food is transported over very long distances  does far more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  than does eating a locally grown diet  28  they also concluded that  shifting less than one day per week u2019s worth of calories from red meat and dairy products to chicken  fish  eggs  or a vegetable-based diet achieves more ghg reduction than buying all locally sourced food   in other words  the amount of red meat consumption is much more important than food miles   a commonly ignored element is the local loop  for example  a gallon of gasoline could transport 5\xa0kg of meat over 60,000 miles (97,000\xa0km  by road (40 tonner at 8 mpg  in bulk transport  or it could transport a single consumer only 30 or 40 miles (64\xa0km  to buy that meat  thus foods from a distant farm that are transported in bulk to a nearby store consumer can have a lower footprint than foods a consumer picks up directly from a farm that is within driving distance but farther away than the store  this can mean that doorstep deliveries of food by companies can lead to lower carbon emissions or energy use than normal shopping practices  29  relative distances and mode of transportation make this calculation complicated  for example  consumers can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of their part of the journey by walking  bicycling  or taking public transport  another impact is that goods being transported by large ships very long distances can have lower associated carbon emissions or energy use than the same goods traveling by truck a much shorter distance  30   lifecycle analysis  a technique that meshes together a wide range of different environmental criteria including emissions and waste  is a more holistic way of assessing the real environmental impact of the food we eat  the technique accounts for energy input and output involved in the production  processing  packaging and transport of food  it also factors in resource depletion  air pollution and water pollution and waste generation municipal solid waste  31   a number of organisations are developing ways of calculating the carbon cost or lifecycle impact of food and agriculture  32  some are more robust than others but  at the moment  there is no easy way to tell which ones are thorough  independent and reliable  and which ones are just marketing hype   even a full lifecycle analysis accounts only for the environmental effects of food production and consumption  important though that is  it is only one of the widely agreed three pillars of sustainable development  namely environmental  social and economic  33   foodpocketstats foodpocketbook2009 pdf   london medway  kent
