Steamturbine
 a steam turbine is a device that extracts thermal energy from pressurized steam and uses it to do mechanical work on a rotating output shaft  its modern manifestation was invented by sir charles parsons in 1884.[1][2   because the turbine generates rotary motion  it is particularly suited to be used to drive an electrical generator xa0\u2013 about 90  of all electricity generation in the united states (1996  is by use of steam turbines  3  the steam turbine is a form of heat engine that derives much of its improvement in thermodynamic efficiency from the use of multiple stages in the expansion of the steam  which results in a closer approach to the ideal reversible expansion process       the first device that may be classified as a reaction steam turbine was little more than a toy  the classic aeolipile  described in the 1st century by greek mathematician hero of alexandria in roman egypt  4][5][6  in 1551  taqi al-din in ottoman egypt described a steam turbine with the practical application of rotating a spit  steam turbines were also described by the italian giovanni branca (1629)[7  and john wilkins in england (1648).[8  the devices described by taqi al-din and wilkins are today known as steam jacks  in 1672 an impulse steam turbine driven car was designed by ferdinand verbiest  a more modern version of this car was produced some time in the late 18th century by an unknown german mechanic   the modern steam turbine was invented in 1884 by sir charles parsons  whose first model was connected to a dynamo that generated 7.5\xa0kw (10\xa0hp  of electricity  9  the invention of parsons  steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible and revolutionized marine transport and naval warfare  10  parsons  design was a reaction type  his patent was licensed and the turbine scaled-up shortly after by an american  george westinghouse  the parsons turbine also turned out to be easy to scale up  parsons had the satisfaction of seeing his invention adopted for all major world power stations  and the size of generators had increased from his first 7.5\xa0kw set up to units of 50,000\xa0kw capacity  within parson s lifetime  the generating capacity of a unit was scaled up by about 10,000 times  11  and the total output from turbo-generators constructed by his firm c  a  parsons and company and by their licensees  for land purposes alone  had exceeded thirty million horse-power  9   a number of other variations of turbines have been developed that work effectively with steam  the de laval turbine  invented by gustaf de laval  accelerated the steam to full speed before running it against a turbine blade  de laval s impulse turbine is simpler  less expensive and does not need to be pressure-proof  it can operate with any pressure of steam  but is considerably less efficient  citation needed  fr auguste rateau developed a pressure compounded impulse turbine using the de laval principle as early as 1896,[12  obtained a us patent in 1903  and applied the turbine to a french torpedo boat in 1904  he taught at the \xc9cole des mines de saint- xc9tienne for a decade until 1897  and later founded a successful company that was incorporated into the alstom firm after his death  one of the founders of the modern theory of steam and gas turbines was aurel stodola  a slovak physicist and engineer and professor at the swiss polytechnical institute  now eth  in zurich  his work die dampfturbinen und ihre aussichten als w xe4rmekraftmaschinen  english  the steam turbine and its prospective use as a heat engine  was published in berlin in 1903  a further book dampf und gas-turbinen  english  steam and gas turbines  was published in 1922   the brown-curtis turbine  an impulse type  which had been originally developed and patented by the u s  company international curtis marine turbine company  was developed in the 1900s in conjunction with john brown  amp  company  it was used in john brown-engined merchant ships and warships  including liners and royal navy warships   the present-day manufacturing industry for steam turbines is dominated by chinese power equipment makers  harbin electric  shanghai electric  and dongfang electric  the top three power equipment makers in china  collectively hold a majority stake in the worldwide market share for steam turbines in 2009-10 according to platts  13  other manufacturers with minor market share include bhel  siemens  alstom  ge  doosan \u0160koda power  mitsubishi heavy industries  and toshiba  13  the consulting firm frost  amp  sullivan projects that manufacturing of steam turbines will become more consolidated by 2020 as chinese power manufacturers win increasing business outside of china  14   steam turbines are made in a variety of sizes ranging from small &lt 0.75\xa0kw (&lt 1\xa0hp  units  rare  used as mechanical drives for pumps  compressors and other shaft driven equipment  to 1\xa0500\xa0000\xa0kw (1.5\xa0gw  2\xa0000\xa0000\xa0hp  turbines used to generate electricity  there are several classifications for modern steam turbines   turbine blades are of two basic types  blades and nozzles  blades move entirely due to the impact of steam on them and their profiles do not converge  this results in a steam velocity drop and essentially no pressure drop as steam moves through the blades  a turbine composed of blades alternating with fixed nozzles is called an impulse turbine  curtis turbine  rateau turbine  or brown-curtis turbine  nozzles appear similar to blades  but their profiles converge near the exit  this results in a steam pressure drop and velocity increase as steam moves through the nozzles  nozzles move due to both the impact of steam on them and the reaction due to the high-velocity steam at the exit  a turbine composed of moving nozzles alternating with fixed nozzles is called a reaction turbine or parsons turbine   except for low-power applications  turbine blades are arranged in multiple stages in series  called compounding  which greatly improves efficiency at low speeds  15  a reaction stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving nozzles  multiple reaction stages divide the pressure drop between the steam inlet and exhaust into numerous small drops  resulting in a pressure-compounded turbine  impulse stages may be either pressure-compounded  velocity-compounded  or pressure-velocity compounded  a pressure-compounded impulse stage is a row of fixed nozzles followed by a row of moving blades  with multiple stages for compounding  this is also known as a rateau turbine  after its inventor  a velocity-compounded impulse stage  invented by curtis and also called a  curtis wheel   is a row of fixed nozzles followed by two or more rows of moving blades alternating with rows of fixed blades  this divides the velocity drop across the stage into several smaller drops  16  a series of velocity-compounded impulse stages is called a pressure-velocity compounded turbine   by 1905  when steam turbines were coming into use on fast ships  such as hms xa0dreadnought  and in land-based power applications  it had been determined that it was desirable to use one or more curtis wheels at the beginning of a multi-stage turbine  where the steam pressure is highest   followed by reaction stages  this was more efficient with high-pressure steam due to reduced leakage between the turbine rotor and the casing  17  this is illustrated in the drawing of the german 1905 aeg marine steam turbine  the steam from the boilers enters from the right at high pressure through a throttle  controlled manually by an operator  in this case a sailor known as the throttleman   it passes through five curtis wheels and numerous reaction stages  the small blades at the edges of the two large rotors in the middle  before exiting at low pressure  almost certainly to a condenser  the condenser provides a vacuum that maximizes the energy extracted from the steam  and condenses the steam into feedwater to be returned to the boilers  on the left are several additional reaction stages  on two large rotors  that rotate the turbine in reverse for astern operation  with steam admitted by a separate throttle  since ships are rarely operated in reverse  efficiency is not a priority in astern turbines  so only a few stages are used to save cost   a major challenge facing turbine design is reducing the creep experienced by the blades  because of the high temperatures and high stresses of operation  steam turbine materials become damaged through these mechanisms  as temperatures are increased in an effort to improve turbine efficiency  creep becomes more significant  to limit creep  thermal coatings and superalloys with solid-solution strengthening and grain boundary strengthening are used in blade designs   protective coatings are used to reduce the thermal damage and to limit oxidation  these coatings are often stabilized zirconium dioxide-based ceramics  using a thermal protective coating limits the temperature exposure of the nickel superalloy  this reduces the creep mechanisms experienced in the blade  oxidation coatings limit efficiency losses caused by a buildup on the outside of the blades  which is especially important in the high-temperature environment  18   the nickel-based blades are alloyed with aluminum and titanium to improve strength and creep resistance  the microstructure of these alloys is composed of different regions of composition  a uniform dispersion of the gamma-prime phase \u2013 a combination of nickel  aluminum  and titanium \u2013 promotes the strength and creep resistance of the blade due to the microstructure  19   refractory elements such as rhenium and ruthenium can be added to the alloy to improve creep strength  the addition of these elements reduces the diffusion of the gamma prime phase  thus preserving the fatigue resistance  strength  and creep resistance  20   these types include condensing  non-condensing  reheat  extraction and induction   condensing turbines are most commonly found in electrical power plants  these turbines receive steam from a boiler and exhaust it to a condenser  the exhausted steam is at a pressure well below atmospheric  and is in a partially condensed state  typically of a quality near 90    non-condensing or back pressure turbines are most widely used for process steam applications  the exhaust pressure is controlled by a regulating valve to suit the needs of the process steam pressure  these are commonly found at refineries  district heating units  pulp and paper plants  and desalination facilities where large amounts of low pressure process steam are needed   reheat turbines are also used almost exclusively in electrical power plants  in a reheat turbine  steam flow exits from a high-pressure section of the turbine and is returned to the boiler where additional superheat is added  the steam then goes back into an intermediate pressure section of the turbine and continues its expansion  using reheat in a cycle increases the work output from the turbine and also the expansion reaches conclusion before the steam condenses  thereby minimizing the erosion of the blades in last rows  in most of the cases  maximum number of reheats employed in a cycle is 2 as the cost of super-heating the steam negates the increase in the work output from turbine   extracting type turbines are common in all applications  in an extracting type turbine  steam is released from various stages of the turbine  and used for industrial process needs or sent to boiler feedwater heaters to improve overall cycle efficiency  extraction flows may be controlled with a valve  or left uncontrolled   induction turbines introduce low pressure steam at an intermediate stage to produce additional power   these arrangements include single casing  tandem compound and cross compound turbines  single casing units are the most basic style where a single casing and shaft are coupled to a generator  tandem compound are used where two or more casings are directly coupled together to drive a single generator  a cross compound turbine arrangement features two or more shafts not in line driving two or more generators that often operate at different speeds  a cross compound turbine is typically used for many large applications  a typical 1930s-1960s naval installation is illustrated below  this shows high- and low-pressure turbines driving a common reduction gear  with a geared cruising turbine on one high-pressure turbine   the moving steam imparts both a tangential and axial thrust on the turbine shaft  but the axial thrust in a simple turbine is unopposed  to maintain the correct rotor position and balancing  this force must be counteracted by an opposing force  thrust bearings can be used for the shaft bearings  the rotor can use dummy pistons  it can be double flow- the steam enters in the middle of the shaft and exits at both ends  or a combination of any of these  in a double flow rotor  the blades in each half face opposite ways  so that the axial forces negate each other but the tangential forces act together  this design of rotor is also called two-flow  double-axial-flow  or double-exhaust  this arrangement is common in low-pressure casings of a compound turbine  21   an ideal steam turbine is considered to be an isentropic process  or constant entropy process  in which the entropy of the steam entering the turbine is equal to the entropy of the steam leaving the turbine  no steam turbine is truly isentropic  however  with typical isentropic efficiencies ranging from 20\u201390  based on the application of the turbine  the interior of a turbine comprises several sets of blades or buckets  one set of stationary blades is connected to the casing and one set of rotating blades is connected to the shaft  the sets intermesh with certain minimum clearances  with the size and configuration of sets varying to efficiently exploit the expansion of steam at each stage   to maximize turbine efficiency the steam is expanded  doing work  in a number of stages  these stages are characterized by how the energy is extracted from them and are known as either impulse or reaction turbines  most steam turbines use a mixture of the reaction and impulse designs  each stage behaves as either one or the other  but the overall turbine uses both  typically  lower pressure sections are reaction type and higher pressure stages are impulse type  citation needed   an impulse turbine has fixed nozzles that orient the steam flow into high speed jets  these jets contain significant kinetic energy  which is converted into shaft rotation by the bucket-like shaped rotor blades  as the steam jet changes direction  a pressure drop occurs across only the stationary blades  with a net increase in steam velocity across the stage  as the steam flows through the nozzle its pressure falls from inlet pressure to the exit pressure  atmospheric pressure  or more usually  the condenser vacuum   due to this high ratio of expansion of steam  the steam leaves the nozzle with a very high velocity  the steam leaving the moving blades has a large portion of the maximum velocity of the steam when leaving the nozzle  the loss of energy due to this higher exit velocity is commonly called the carry over velocity or leaving loss   the law of moment of momentum states that the sum of the moments of external forces acting on a fluid which is temporarily occupying the control volume is equal to the net time change of angular momentum flux through the control volume   the swirling fluid enters the control volume at

reach top values up to about 50  in a 1200\xa0mw turbine  smaller ones have a lower efficiency  22  citation needed   because of the high pressures used in the steam circuits and the materials used  steam turbines and their casings have high thermal inertia  when warming up a steam turbine for use  the main steam stop valves  after the boiler  have a bypass line to allow superheated steam to slowly bypass the valve and proceed to heat up the lines in the system along with the steam turbine  also  a turning gear is engaged when there is no steam to slowly rotate the turbine to ensure even heating to prevent uneven expansion  after first rotating the turbine by the turning gear  allowing time for the rotor to assume a straight plane  no bowing   then the turning gear is disengaged and steam is admitted to the turbine  first to the astern blades then to the ahead blades slowly rotating the turbine at 10\u201315\xa0rpm (0.17\u20130.25\xa0hz  to slowly warm the turbine  the warm-up procedure for large steam turbines may exceed ten hours  23   during normal operation  rotor imbalance can lead to vibration  which  because of the high rotation velocities  could lead to a blade breaking away from the rotor and through the casing  to reduce this risk  considerable efforts are spent to balance the turbine  also  turbines are run with high-quality steam  either superheated  dry  steam  or saturated steam with a high dryness fraction  this prevents the rapid impingement and erosion of the blades which occurs when condensed water is blasted onto the blades  moisture carry over   also  liquid water entering the blades may damage the thrust bearings for the turbine shaft  to prevent this  along with controls and baffles in the boilers to ensure high-quality steam  condensate drains are installed in the steam piping leading to the turbine   maintenance requirements of modern steam turbines are simple and incur low costs  typically around $0.005 per kwh   23  their operational life often exceeds 50 years  23   the control of a turbine with a governor is essential  as turbines need to be run up slowly to prevent damage and some applications  such as the generation of alternating current electricity  require precise speed control  24  uncontrolled acceleration of the turbine rotor can lead to an overspeed trip  which causes the governor and throttle valves that control the flow of steam to the turbine to close  if these valves fail then the turbine may continue accelerating until it breaks apart  often catastrophically  turbines are expensive to make  requiring precision manufacture and special quality materials   during normal operation in synchronization with the electricity network  power plants are governed with a five percent droop speed control  this means the full load speed is 100  and the no-load speed is 105   this is required for the stable operation of the network without hunting and drop-outs of power plants  normally the changes in speed are minor  adjustments in power output are made by slowly raising the droop curve by increasing the spring pressure on a centrifugal governor  generally this is a basic system requirement for all power plants because the older and newer plants have to be compatible in response to the instantaneous changes in frequency without depending on outside communication  25   the steam turbine operates on basic principles of thermodynamics using the part 3-4 of the rankine cycle shown in the adjoining diagram  superheated steam  or dry saturated steam  depending on application  leaves the boiler at high temperature and high pressure  at entry to the turbine  the steam gains kinetic energy by passing through a nozzle  a fixed nozzle in an impulse type turbine or the fixed blades in a reaction type turbine   when the steam leaves the nozzle it is moving at high velocity towards the blades of the turbine rotor  a force is created on the blades due to the pressure of the vapor on the blades causing them to move  a generator or other such device can be placed on the shaft  and the energy that was in the steam can now be stored and used  the steam leaves the turbine as a saturated vapor  or liquid-vapor mix depending on application  at a lower temperature and pressure than it entered with and is sent to the condenser to be cooled  26  the first law enables us to find a formula for the rate at which work is developed per unit mass  assuming there is no heat transfer to the surrounding environment and that the changes in kinetic and potential energy are negligible compared to the change in specific enthalpy we arrive at the following equation  where  to measure how well a turbine is performing we can look at its isentropic efficiency  this compares the actual performance of the turbine with the performance that would be achieved by an ideal  isentropic  turbine  27  when calculating this efficiency  heat lost to the surroundings is assumed to be zero  the starting pressure and temperature is the same for both the actual and the ideal turbines  but at turbine exit the energy content   specific enthalpy   for the actual turbine is greater than that for the ideal turbine because of irreversibility in the actual turbine  the specific enthalpy is evaluated at the same pressure for the actual and ideal turbines in order to give a good comparison between the two   the isentropic efficiency is found by dividing the actual work by the ideal work  27   where   but note that the adjacent diagram does not show state 4s  it is vertically below state 3   electrical power stations use large steam turbines driving electric generators to produce most  about 80   of the world s electricity  the advent of large steam turbines made central-station electricity generation practical  since reciprocating steam engines of large rating became very bulky  and operated at slow speeds  most central stations are fossil fuel power plants and nuclear power plants  some installations use geothermal steam  or use concentrated solar power  csp  to create the steam  steam turbines can also be used directly to drive large centrifugal pumps  such as feedwater pumps at a thermal power plant   the turbines used for electric power generation are most often directly coupled to their generators  as the generators must rotate at constant synchronous speeds according to the frequency of the electric power system  the most common speeds are 3,000\xa0rpm for 50\xa0hz systems  and 3,600\xa0rpm for 60\xa0hz systems  since nuclear reactors have lower temperature limits than fossil-fired plants  with lower steam quality  the turbine generator sets may be arranged to operate at half these speeds  but with four-pole generators  to reduce erosion of turbine blades  28   in steamships  advantages of steam turbines over reciprocating engines are smaller size  lower maintenance  lighter weight  and lower vibration  a steam turbine is only efficient when operating in the thousands of rpm  while the most effective propeller designs are for speeds less than 300 rpm  consequently  precise  thus expensive  reduction gears are usually required  although numerous early ships through world war i  such as turbinia  had direct drive from the steam turbines to the propeller shafts  another alternative is turbo-electric transmission  in which an electrical generator run by the high-speed turbine is used to run one or more slow-speed electric motors connected to the propeller shafts  precision gear cutting may be a production bottleneck during wartime  turbo-electric drive was most used in large us warships designed during world war i and in some fast liners  and was used in some troop transports and mass-production destroyer escorts in world war ii   the higher cost of turbines and the associated gears or generator motor sets is offset by lower maintenance requirements and the smaller size of a turbine when compared to a reciprocating engine having an equivalent power  although the fuel costs are higher than a diesel engine because steam turbines have lower thermal efficiency  to reduce fuel costs the thermal efficiency of both types of engine have been improved over the years  today  propulsion steam turbine cycle efficiencies have yet to break 50   yet diesel engines routinely exceed 50   especially in marine applications  29][30][31  diesel power plants also have lower operating costs since fewer operators are required  thus  conventional steam power is used in very few new ships  an exception is lng carriers which often find it more economical to use boil-off gas with a steam turbine than to re-liquify it   nuclear-powered ships and submarines use a nuclear reactor to create steam for turbines  nuclear power is often chosen where diesel power would be impractical  as in submarine applications  or the logistics of refuelling pose significant problems  for example  icebreakers   it has been estimated that the reactor fuel for the royal navy s vanguard-class xa0submarines is sufficient to last 40 circumnavigations of the globe \u2013 potentially sufficient for the vessel s entire service life  nuclear propulsion has only been applied to a very few commercial vessels due to the expense of maintenance and the regulatory controls required on nuclear systems and fuel cycles   the development of steam turbine marine propulsion from 1894-1935 was dominated by the need to reconcile the high efficient speed of the turbine with the low efficient speed  less than 300 rpm  of the ship s propeller at an overall cost competitive with reciprocating engines  in 1894  efficient reduction gears were not available for the high powers required by ships  so direct drive was necessary  in turbinia  which has direct drive to each propeller shaft  the efficient speed of the turbine was reduced after initial trials by directing the steam flow through all three direct drive turbines  one on each shaft  in series  probably totaling around 200 turbine stages operating in series  also  there were three propellers on each shaft for operation at high speeds  32  the high shaft speeds of the era are represented by one of the first us turbine-powered destroyers  uss xa0smith  launched in 1909  which had direct drive turbines and whose three shafts turned at 724 rpm at 28.35 knots  33  the use of turbines in several casings exhausting steam to each other in series became standard in most subsequent marine propulsion applications  and is a form of cross-compounding  the first turbine was called the high pressure  hp  turbine  the last turbine was the low pressure  lp  turbine  and any turbine in between was an intermediate pressure  ip  turbine  a much later arrangement than turbinia can be seen on rms xa0queen mary in long beach  california  launched in 1934  in which each shaft is powered by four turbines in series connected to the ends of the two input shafts of a single-reduction gearbox  they are the hp  1st ip  2nd ip  and lp turbines   the quest for economy was even more important when cruising speeds were considered  cruising speed is roughly 50  of a warship s maximum speed and 20-25  of its maximum power level  this would be a speed used on long voyages when fuel economy is desired  although this brought the propeller speeds down to an efficient range  turbine efficiency was greatly reduced  and early turbine ships had poor cruising ranges  a solution that proved useful through most of the steam turbine propulsion era was the cruising turbine  this was an extra turbine to add even more stages  at first attached directly to one or more shafts  exhausting to a stage partway along the hp turbine  and not used at high speeds  as reduction gears became available around 1911  some ships  notably the battleship uss xa0nevada  had them on cruising turbines while retaining direct drive main turbines  reduction gears allowed turbines to operate in their efficient range at a much higher speed than the shaft  but were expensive to manufacture   cruising turbines competed at first with reciprocating engines for fuel economy  an example of the retention of reciprocating engines on fast ships was the famous rms xa0titanic of 1911  which along with her sisters rms xa0olympic and hmhs xa0britannic had triple-expansion engines on the two outboard shafts  both exhausting to an lp turbine on the center shaft  after adopting turbines with the delaware-class xa0battleships launched in 1909  the united states navy reverted to reciprocating machinery on the new york-class xa0battleships of 1912  then went back to turbines on nevada in 1914  the lingering fondness for reciprocating machinery was because the us navy had no plans for capital ships exceeding 21 knots until after world war i  so top speed was less important than economical cruising  the united states had acquired the philippines and hawaii as territories in 1898  and lacked the british royal navy s worldwide network of coaling stations  thus  the us navy in 1900-1940 had the greatest need of any nation for fuel economy  especially as the prospect of war with japan arose following world war i  this need was compounded by the us not launching any cruisers 1908-1920  so destroyers were required to perform long-range missions usually assigned to cruisers  so  various cruising solutions were fitted on us destroyers launched 1908-1916  these included small reciprocating engines and geared or ungeared cruising turbines on one or two shafts  however  once fully geared turbines proved economical in initial cost and fuel they were rapidly adopted  with cruising turbines also included on most ships  beginning in 1915 all new royal navy destroyers had fully geared turbines  and the united states followed in 1917   in the royal navy  speed was a priority until the battle of jutland in mid-1916 showed that in the battlecruisers too much armour had been sacrificed in its pursuit  the british used exclusively turbine-powered warships from 1906  because they recognized that a significant cruising range would be desirable given their worldwide empire  some warships  notably the queen elizabeth-class xa0battleships  were fitted with cruising turbines from 1912 onwards following earlier experimental installations   in the us navy  the mahan-class xa0destroyers  launched 1935\u201336  introduced double-reduction gearing  this further increased the turbine speed above the shaft speed  allowing smaller turbines than single-reduction gearing  steam pressures and temperatures were also increasing progressively  from 300 psi 425 f (2.07 mpa 218 c  saturation temperature  on the world war i-era wickes xa0class to 615 psi 850 f (4.25 mpa 454 c  superheated steam on some world war ii fletcher-class xa0destroyers and later ships  34][35  a standard configuration emerged of an axial-flow high-pressure turbine  sometimes with a cruising turbine attached  and a double-axial-flow low-pressure turbine connected to a double-reduction gearbox  this arrangement continued throughout the steam era in the us navy and was also used in some royal navy designs  36][37  machinery of this configuration can be seen on many preserved world war ii-era warships in several countries  38  when us navy warship construction resumed in the early 1950s  most surface combatants and aircraft carriers used 1,200 psi 950 f (8.28 mpa 510 c  steam  39  this continued until the end of the us navy steam-powered warship era with the knox-class frigates of the early 1970s  amphibious and auxiliary ships continued to use 600 psi (4.14 mpa  steam post-world war ii  with uss xa0iwo jima  launched in 2001  possibly the last non-nuclear steam-powered ship built for the us navy   turbo-electric drive was introduced on the battleship uss xa0new mexico  launched in 1917  over the next eight years the us navy launched five additional turbo-electric-powered battleships and two aircraft carriers  initially ordered as lexington-class xa0battlecruisers   ten more turbo-electric capital ships were planned  but cancelled due to the limits imposed by the washington naval treaty  although new mexico was refitted with geared turbines in a 1931-33 refit  the remaining turbo-electric ships retained the system throughout their careers  this system used two large steam turbine generators to drive an electric motor on each of four shafts  the system was less costly initially than reduction gears and made the ships more maneuverable in port  with the shafts able to reverse rapidly and deliver more reverse power than with most geared systems  some ocean liners were also built with turbo-electric drive  as were some troop transports and mass-production destroyer escorts in world war ii  however  when the us designed the  treaty cruisers   beginning with uss xa0pensacola launched in 1927  geared turbines were used to conserve weight  and remained in use for all fast steam-powered ships thereafter   since the 1980s  steam turbines have been replaced by gas turbines on fast ships and by diesel engines on other ships  exceptions are nuclear-powered ships and submarines and lng carriers  40  some auxiliary ships continue to use steam propulsion  in the u s  navy  the conventionally powered steam turbine is still in use on all but one of the wasp-class amphibious assault ships  the u s  navy also operates steam turbines on their nuclear powered nimitz-class and

main advantages of a steam turbine locomotive are better rotational balance and reduced hammer blow on the track  however  a disadvantage is less flexible output power so that turbine locomotives were best suited for long-haul operations at a constant output power  41   the first steam turbine rail locomotive was built in 1908 for the officine meccaniche miani silvestri grodona comi  milan  italy

procedures and definitions used to test steam turbines  selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer  and has some significance to the design of the turbine and associated systems  in the united states  asme has produced several performance test codes on steam turbines  these include asme ptc 6-2004  steam turbines  asme ptc 6.2-2011  steam

steam turbines  the single most important and differentiating characteristic of asme performance test codes  including ptc 6  is that the test uncertainty of the measurement indicates the quality of the test and is not to be used as a commercial tolerance  42
