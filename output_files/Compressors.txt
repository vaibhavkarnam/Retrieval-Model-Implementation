Compressors
 a gas compressor is a mechanical device that increases the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume  an air compressor is a specific type of gas compressor   compressors are similar to pumps  both increase the pressure on a fluid and both can transport the fluid through a pipe  as gases are compressible  the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas  liquids are relatively incompressible  while some can be compressed  the main action of a pump is to pressurize and transport liquids       the main types of gas compressors are illustrated and discussed below   reciprocating compressors use pistons driven by a crankshaft  they can be either stationary or portable  can be single or multi-staged  and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines  1][2][3  small reciprocating compressors from 5 to 30\xa0horsepower  hp  are commonly seen in automotive applications and are typically for intermittent duty  larger reciprocating compressors well over 1,000\xa0hp (750\xa0kw  are commonly found in large industrial and petroleum applications  discharge pressures can range from low pressure to very high pressure (&gt 18000 psi or 180 mpa   in certain applications  such as air compression  multi-stage double-acting compressors are said to be the most efficient compressors available  and are typically larger  and more costly than comparable rotary units  4  another type of reciprocating compressor is the swash plate compressor  which uses pistons moved by a swash plate mounted on a shaft  see axial piston pump    household  home workshop  and smaller job site compressors are typically reciprocating compressors 1\xbd xa0hp or less with an attached receiver tank   an ionic liquid piston compressor  ionic compressor or ionic liquid piston pump is a hydrogen compressor based on an ionic liquid piston instead of a metal piston as in a piston-metal diaphragm compressor  5   rotary screw compressors use two meshed rotating positive-displacement helical screws to force the gas into a smaller space  1][6][7  these are usually used for continuous operation in commercial and industrial applications and may be either stationary or portable  their application can be from 3 horsepower (2.2\xa0kw  to over 1,200 horsepower (890\xa0kw  and from low pressure to moderately high pressure (&gt 1,200\xa0psi or 8.3\xa0mpa    rotary screw compressors are commercially produced in oil flooded  water flooded and dry type  the efficiency of rotary compressors depends on the air drier  clarification needed  and the selection of air drier is always 1.5 times volumetric delivery of the compressor  citation needed   rotary vane compressors consist of a rotor with a number of blades inserted in radial slots in the rotor  the rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape  as the rotor turns  blades slide in and out of the slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing  1  thus  a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades  rotary vane compressors are  with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies   with suitable port connections  the devices may be either a compressor or a vacuum pump  they can be either stationary or portable  can be single or multi-staged  and can be driven by electric motors or internal combustion engines  dry vane machines are used at relatively low pressures  e g   2\xa0bar or 200\xa0kpa or 29\xa0psi  for bulk material movement while oil-injected machines have the necessary volumetric efficiency to achieve pressures up to about 13\xa0bar (1,300\xa0kpa  190\xa0psi  in a single stage  a rotary vane compressor is well suited to electric motor drive and is significantly quieter in operation than the equivalent piston compressor   rotary vane compressors can have mechanical efficiencies of about 90%.[8   rolling piston forces gas against a stationary vane   a scroll compressor  also known as scroll pump and scroll vacuum pump  uses two interleaved spiral-like vanes to pump or compress fluids such as liquids and gases  the vane geometry may be involute  archimedean spiral  or hybrid curves  9][10][11  they operate more smoothly  quietly  and reliably than other types of compressors in the lower volume range   often  one of the scrolls is fixed  while the other orbits eccentrically without rotating  thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between the scrolls   due to minimum clearance volume between the fixed scroll and the orbiting scroll  these compressors have a very high volumetric efficiency   this type of compressor was used as the supercharger on volkswagen g60 and g40 engines in the early 1990s   a diaphragm compressor  also known as a membrane compressor  is a variant of the conventional reciprocating compressor  the compression of gas occurs by the movement of a flexible membrane  instead of an intake element  the back and forth movement of the membrane is driven by a rod and a crankshaft mechanism  only the membrane and the compressor box come in contact with the gas being compressed  1   the degree of flexing and the material constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment  generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking  but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures  rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion  but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications  and they need to be replaced as plastic embrittlement occurs   diaphragm compressors are used for hydrogen and compressed natural gas  cng  as well as in a number of other applications   the photograph on the right depicts a three-stage diaphragm compressor used to compress hydrogen gas to 6,000\xa0psi (41\xa0mpa  for use in a prototype compressed hydrogen and compressed natural gas  cng  fueling station built in downtown phoenix  arizona by the arizona public service company  an electric utilities company   reciprocating compressors were used to compress the natural gas  the reciprocating natural gas compressor was developed by sertco  12   the prototype alternative fueling station was built in compliance with all of the prevailing safety  environmental and building codes in phoenix to demonstrate that such fueling stations could be built in urban areas   dynamic compressors depend upon the inertia and momentum of a fluid   also known as a trompe  a mixture of air and water generated through turbulence is allowed to fall into a subterranean chamber where the air separates from the water  the weight of falling water compresses the air in the top of the chamber  a submerged outlet from the chamber allows water to flow to the surface at a lower height than the intake  an outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air to the surface  a facility on this principle was built on the montreal river at ragged shutes near cobalt  ontario in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines  13   centrifugal compressors use a rotating disk or impeller in a shaped housing to force the gas to the rim of the impeller  increasing the velocity of the gas  a diffuser  divergent duct  section converts the velocity energy to pressure energy  they are primarily used for continuous  stationary service in industries such as oil refineries  chemical and petrochemical plants and natural gas processing plants  1][14][15  their application can be from 100 horsepower (75\xa0kw  to thousands of horsepower  with multiple staging  they can achieve high output pressures greater than 10,000\xa0psi (69\xa0mpa    many large snowmaking operations  like ski resorts  use this type of compressor  they are also used in internal combustion engines as superchargers and turbochargers  centrifugal compressors are used in small gas turbine engines or as the final compression stage of medium-sized gas turbines   diagonal or mixed-flow compressors are similar to centrifugal compressors  but have a radial and axial velocity component at the exit from the rotor  the diffuser is often used to turn diagonal flow to an axial rather than radial direction  citation needed   axial-flow compressors are dynamic rotating compressors that use arrays of fan-like airfoils to progressively compress a fluid  they are used where high flow rates or a compact design are required   the arrays of airfoils are set in rows  usually as pairs  one rotating and one stationary  the rotating airfoils  also known as blades or rotors  accelerate the fluid  the stationary airfoils  also known as stators or vanes  decelerate and redirect the flow direction of the fluid  preparing it for the rotor blades of the next stage  1  axial compressors are almost always multi-staged  with the cross-sectional area of the gas passage diminishing along the compressor to maintain an optimum axial mach number  beyond about 5 stages or a 4:1 design pressure ratio a compressor will not function unless fitted with features such as stationary vanes with variable angles  known as variable inlet guide vanes and variable stators   the ability to allow some air to escape part-way along the compressor  known as interstage bleed  and being split into more than one rotating assembly  known as twin spools  for example    axial compressors can have high efficiencies  around 90  polytropic at their design conditions  however  they are relatively expensive  requiring a large number of components  tight tolerances and high quality materials  axial-flow compressors are used in medium to large gas turbine engines  natural gas pumping stations  and some chemical plants   compressors used in refrigeration systems are often described as being either hermetic  open  or semi-hermetic  to describe how the compressor and motor drive are situated in relation to the gas or vapor being compressed  the industry name for a hermetic is hermetically sealed compressor  while a semi-hermetic is commonly called a semi-hermetic compressor   in hermetic and most semi-hermetic compressors  the compressor and motor driving the compressor are integrated  and operate within the pressurized gas envelope of the system  the motor is designed to operate in  and be cooled by  the refrigerant gas being compressed   the difference between the hermetic and semi-hermetic  is that the hermetic uses a one-piece welded steel casing that cannot be opened for repair  if the hermetic fails it is simply replaced with an entire new unit  a semi-hermetic uses a large cast metal shell with gasketed covers that can be opened to replace motor and pump components   the primary advantage of a hermetic and semi-hermetic is that there is no route for the gas to leak out of the system  open compressors rely on shaft seals to retain the internal pressure  and these seals require a lubricant such as oil to retain their sealing properties   an open pressurized system such as an automobile air conditioner can be more susceptible to leak its operating gases  open systems rely on lubricant in the system to splash on pump components and seals  if it is not operated frequently enough  the lubricant on the seals slowly evaporates  and then the seals begin to leak until the system is no longer functional and must be recharged  by comparison  a hermetic system can sit unused for years  and can usually be started up again at any time without requiring maintenance or experiencing any loss of system pressure   the disadvantage of hermetic compressors is that the motor drive cannot be repaired or maintained  and the entire compressor must be replaced if a motor fails  a further disadvantage is that burnt-out windings can contaminate whole systems  thereby requiring the system to be entirely pumped down and the gas replaced  typically  hermetic compressors are used in low-cost factory-assembled consumer goods where the cost of repair is high compared to the value of the device  and it would be more economical to just purchase a new device   an advantage of open compressors is that they can be driven by non-electric power sources  such as an internal combustion engine or turbine  however  open compressors that drive refrigeration systems are generally not totally maintenance-free throughout the life of the system  since some gas leakage will occur over time   a compressor can be idealized as internally reversible and adiabatic  thus an isentropic steady state device  meaning the change in entropy is 0.[16  by defining the compression cycle as isentropic  an ideal efficiency for the process can be attained  and the ideal compressor performance can be compared to the actual performance of the machine  isotropic compression as used in asme ptc 10 code refers to a reversible  adiabatic compression process [17   isentropic efficiency of compressors   comparison of the differential form of the energy balance for each device nlet  n n n nq n n n   displaystyle q

heat rejection during the compression process  one common way of cooling the gas during compression is to use cooling jackets around the casing of the compressor  16   ideal rankine cycle 1- gt 2

with ideal cycles  real world cycles have inherent losses due to inefficient compressors and turbines  the real world system are not truly isentropic but are rather idealized as isentropic for calculation purposes   compression of a gas increases its temperature   where  or  and  so  in which p is pressure  v is volume  n takes different values for different compression processes  see below   and 1  amp  2 refer to initial and final states   with t1 and t2 in degrees rankine or kelvins  p2 and p1 being absolute pressures and k   ratio of specific heats  approximately 1.4 for air   the rise in air and temperature ratio means compression does not follow a simple pressure to volume ratio  this is less efficient  but quick  adiabatic compression or expansion more closely model real life when a compressor has good insulation  a large gas volume  or a short time scale  i e   a high power level   in practice there will always be a certain amount of heat flow out of the compressed gas  thus  making a perfect adiabatic compressor would require perfect heat insulation of all parts of the machine  for example  even a bicycle tire pump s metal tube becomes hot as you compress the air to fill a tire  the relation between temperature and compression ratio described above means that the value of n for an adiabatic process is k  the ratio of specific heats    for an isothermal process  n is 1  so the value of the work integral for an isothermal process is   when evaluated  the isothermal work is found to be lower than the adiabatic work   in the case of centrifugal compressors  commercial designs currently do not exceed a compression ratio of more than a 3.5 to 1 in any one stage  for a typical gas   since compression raises the temperature  the compressed gas is to be cooled between stages making the compression less adiabatic and more isothermal  the inter-stage coolers typically result in some partial condensation that is removed in vapor-liquid separators   in the case of small reciprocating compressors  the compressor flywheel may drive a cooling fan that directs ambient air across the intercooler of a two or more stage compressor   because rotary screw compressors can make use of cooling lubricant to reduce the temperature rise from compression  they very often exceed a 9 to 1 compression ratio  for instance  in a typical diving compressor the air is compressed in three stages  if each stage has a compression ratio of 7 to 1  the compressor can output 343 times atmospheric pressure (7 \xd7 7 \xd7 7   343 atmospheres   (343\xa0atm or 34.8\xa0mpa or 5.04\xa0ksi   there are many options for the motor that powers the compressor   gas compressors are used in various applications where either higher pressures or lower volumes of gas are needed   diving air compressor in noise reduction cabinet
