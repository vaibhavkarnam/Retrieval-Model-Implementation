Oxygen
 oxygen is a chemical element with symbol xa0o and atomic number 8  it is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds  4  by mass  oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe  after hydrogen and helium  5  at standard temperature and pressure  two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen  a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula o n2  this is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8  of the earth s atmosphere  6  additionally  as oxides the element makes up almost half of the earth s crust  7   dioxygen is used in cellular respiration and many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen  such as proteins  nucleic acids  carbohydrates  and fats  as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells  teeth  and bone  most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water  the major constituent of lifeforms  conversely  oxygen is continuously replenished by photosynthesis  which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide  oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms  another form  allotrope  of oxygen  ozone (o n3   strongly absorbs ultraviolet uvb radiation and the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation  but ozone is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by-product of smog  at low earth orbit altitudes  sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause corrosion of spacecraft  8   oxygen was discovered independently by carl wilhelm scheele  in uppsala  in 1773 or earlier  and joseph priestley in wiltshire  in 1774  but priestley is often given priority because his work was published first  the name oxygen was coined in 1777 by antoine lavoisier  9  whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the then-popular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion  its name derives from the greek roots \u1f40\u03be u03cd u03c2 oxys   acid   literally  sharp   referring to the sour taste of acids and - u03b3\u03b5\u03bd u03ae u03c2 -genes   producer   literally  begetter   because at the time of naming  it was mistakenly thought that all acids required oxygen in their composition   common use of oxygen includes residential heating  internal combustion engines  production of steel  plastics and textiles  brazing  welding and cutting of steels and other metals  rocket propellant  oxygen therapy  and life support systems in aircraft  submarines  spaceflight and diving       one of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century xa0bce greek writer on mechanics  philo of byzantium  in his work pneumatica  philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel s neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck  10  philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass  many centuries later leonardo da vinci built on philo s work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration  11   oxygen was discovered by the polish alchemist sendivogius  12  who considered it the philosopher s stone   in the late 17th xa0century  robert boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion  english chemist john mayow (1641\u20131679  refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus  13  in one experiment  he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air s volume before extinguishing the subjects  14  from this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion   mayow observed that antimony increased in weight when heated  and inferred that the nitroaereus must have combined with it  13  he also thought that the lungs separate nitroaereus from air and pass it into the blood and that animal heat and muscle movement result from the reaction of nitroaereus with certain substances in the body  13  accounts of these and other experiments and ideas were published in 1668 in his work tractatus duo in the tract  de respiratione   14   robert hooke  ole borch  mikhail lomonosov  and pierre bayen all produced oxygen in experiments in the 17th and the 18th century but none of them recognized it as a chemical element  15  this may have been in part due to the prevalence of the philosophy of combustion and corrosion called the phlogiston theory  which was then the favored explanation of those processes   established in 1667 by the german alchemist j  j  becher  and modified by the chemist georg ernst stahl by 1731,[16  phlogiston theory stated that all combustible materials were made of two parts  one part  called phlogiston  was given off when the substance containing it was burned  while the dephlogisticated part was thought to be its true form  or calx  11   highly combustible materials that leave little residue  such as wood or coal  were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston  non-combustible substances that corrode  such as iron  contained very little  air did not play a role in phlogiston theory  nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea  instead  it was based on observations of what happens when something burns  that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process  11  the fact that a substance like wood gains overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products   this theory  while it was on the right track  was unfortunately set up backwards  rather than combustion or corrosion occurring as a result of the decomposition of phlogiston compounds into their base elements with the phlogiston being lost to the air  it is in fact the result of oxygen from the air combining with the base elements to produce oxides  indeed  one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals gain weight in rusting  when they were supposedly losing phlogiston    oxygen was first discovered by swedish pharmacist carl wilhelm scheele  he had produced oxygen gas by heating mercuric oxide and various nitrates in 1771\u20132.[17][6][11  scheele called the gas  fire air  because it was the only known supporter of combustion  and wrote an account of this discovery in a manuscript he titled treatise on air and fire  which he sent to his publisher in 1775  that document was published in 1777.[18   in the meantime  on august 1  1774  an experiment conducted by the british clergyman joseph priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide  hgo  inside a glass tube  which liberated a gas he named  dephlogisticated air   6  he noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it  after breathing the gas himself  he wrote   the feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air  but i fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards   15  priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled  an account of further discoveries in air  which was included in the second volume of his book titled experiments and observations on different kinds of air  11][19  because he published his findings first  priestley is usually given priority in the discovery   the french chemist antoine laurent lavoisier later claimed to have discovered the new substance independently  priestley visited lavoisier in october 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas  scheele also posted a letter to lavoisier on september 30  1774 that described his discovery of the previously unknown substance  but lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it  a copy of the letter was found in scheele s belongings after his death   18   what lavoisier did  although this was disputed at the time  was to conduct the first adequate quantitative experiments on oxidation and give the first correct explanation of how combustion works  6  he used these and similar experiments  all started in 1774  to discredit the phlogiston theory and to prove that the substance discovered by priestley and scheele was a chemical element   in one experiment  lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container  6  he noted that air rushed in when he opened the container  which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed  he also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in  this and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book sur la combustion en g xe9n xe9ral  which was published in 1777.[6  in that work  he proved that air is a mixture of two gases   vital air   which is essential to combustion and respiration  and azote  gk  \u1f04\u03b6\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf u03bd  lifeless    which did not support either  azote later became nitrogen in english  although it has kept the name in french and several other european languages  6   lavoisier renamed  vital air  to oxyg xe8ne in 1777 from the greek roots \u1f40\u03be u03cd u03c2  oxys   acid  literally  sharp   from the taste of acids  and - u03b3\u03b5\u03bd u03ae u03c2 (-gen u0113s   producer  literally begetter   because he mistakenly believed that oxygen was a constituent of all acids  9  chemists  such as sir humphry davy in 1812  eventually determined that lavoisier was wrong in this regard  hydrogen forms the basis for acid chemistry   but by then the name was too well established   oxygen entered the english language despite opposition by english scientists and the fact that the englishman priestley had first isolated the gas and written about it  this is partly due to a poem praising the gas titled  oxygen  in the popular book the botanic garden (1791  by erasmus darwin  grandfather of charles darwin  18   john dalton s original atomic hypothesis presumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another  for example  dalton assumed that water s formula was ho  giving the atomic mass of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen  instead of the modern value of about 16.[20  in 1805  joseph louis gay-lussac and alexander von humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen  and by 1811 amedeo avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water s composition  based on what is now called avogadro s law and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases  21  a   by the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it  using a cascade method  swiss chemist and physicist raoul pierre pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide  which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it  he sent a telegram on december 22  1877 to the french academy of sciences in paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen  22  just two days later  french physicist louis paul cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen  22  only a few drops of the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted  oxygen was liquified in a stable state for the first time on march 29  1883 by polish scientists from jagiellonian university  zygmunt wr xf3blewski and karol olszewski  23   in 1891 scottish chemist james dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen for study  24  the first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by german engineer carl von linde and british engineer william hampson  both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then distilled the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them  25  later  in 1901  oxyacetylene welding was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of acetylene and compressed o n2  this method of welding and cutting metal later became common  25   in 1923  the american scientist robert h  goddard became the first person to develop a rocket engine that burned liquid fuel  the engine used gasoline for fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer  goddard successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56\xa0m at 97\xa0km h on march 16  1926 in auburn  massachusetts  us  25][26   oxygen levels in the atmosphere are trending slightly downward globally  possibly because of fossil-fuel burning  27   at standard temperature and pressure  oxygen is a colorless  odorless  and tasteless gas with the molecular formula o n2  referred to as dioxygen  29   as dioxygen  two oxygen atoms are chemically bound to each other  the bond can be variously described based on level of theory  but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms  the filling of which results in a bond order of two  more specifically  the double bond is the result of sequential  low-to-high energy  or aufbau  filling of orbitals  and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons  after sequential filling of the low \u03c3 and \u03c3  orbitals  \u03c3 overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the o-o molecular axis and \u03c0 overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the o-o molecular axis  and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest \u03c0 and \u03c0  orbitals  28   this combination of cancellations and \u03c3 and \u03c0 overlaps results in dioxygen s double bond character and reactivity  and a triplet electronic ground state  an electron configuration with two unpaired electrons  as is found in dioxygen orbitals  see the filled \u03c0  orbitals in the diagram  that are of equal energy u2014i e   degenerate u2014is a configuration termed a spin triplet state  hence  the ground state of the o n2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen  30  b  the highest energy  partially filled orbitals are antibonding  and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two  because of its unpaired electrons  triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules  which have paired electron spins  this prevents spontaneous combustion  31   in the triplet form  o n2 molecules are paramagnetic  that is  they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field  because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule  and the negative exchange energy between neighboring o n2 molecules  24  liquid oxygen is so magnetic that  in laboratory demonstrations  a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet  32  c   singlet oxygen is a name given to several higher-energy species of molecular o n2 in which all the electron spins are paired  it is much more reactive with common organic molecules than is molecular oxygen per se  in nature  singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis  using the energy of sunlight  33  it is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength  34  and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen  35  carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms  and possibly animals  play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues  36   the common allotrope of elemental oxygen on earth is called dioxygen  o n2  the major part of the earth s atmospheric oxygen  see occurrence   o2 has a bond length of 121\xa0pm and a bond energy of 498\xa0kj xb7mol u22121,[37  which is smaller than the energy of other double bonds or pairs of single bonds in the biosphere and responsible for the exothermic reaction of o2 with any organic molecule  31][38  due to its energy content  o2 is used by complex forms of life  such as animals  in cellular respiration  see biological role   other aspects of o n2 are covered in the remainder of this article   trioxygen (o n3  is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue  39  ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when o n2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of o n2 by ultraviolet  uv  radiation  9  since ozone absorbs strongly in the uv region of the spectrum  the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet  9  near the earth s surface  it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust  39  the metastable molecule tetraoxygen (o n4  was discovered in 2001,[40][41  and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen  it was proven in 2006 that this phase  created by pressurizing o n2 to 20\xa0gpa  is in fact a rhombohedral o n8 cluster  42  this cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either o n2 or o n3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel  40][41  a metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 gpa 43  and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures  this phase becomes superconducting  44   oxygen dissolves more readily in water than nitrogen  and in freshwater more readily than seawater  water in equilibrium with air contains approximately 1 molecule of dissolved o n2 for every 2 molecules of n n2 (1:2   compared with an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1:4  the solubility of oxygen in water is temperature-dependent  and about twice as much (14.6\xa0mg xb7l u22121  dissolves at 0\xa0\xb0c than at 20\xa0\xb0c (7.6\xa0mg xb7l u22121).[15][45  at 25\xa0\xb0c and 1 standard atmosphere (101.3\xa0kpa  of air  freshwater contains about 6.04\xa0milliliters xa0 ml  of oxygen per liter  and seawater contains about 4.95\xa0ml per liter  46  at 5\xa0\xb0c the solubility increases to 9.0\xa0ml (50  more than at 25\xa0\xb0c  per liter for water and 7.2\xa0ml (45  more  per liter for sea water   oxygen condenses at 90.20\xa0k (\u2212182.95\xa0\xb0c  \u2212297.31\xa0\xb0f   and freezes at 54.36\xa0k (\u2212218.79\xa0\xb0c  \u2212361.82\xa0\xb0f   47  both liquid and solid o n2 are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red  in contrast with the blue color of the sky  which is due to rayleigh scattering of blue light   high-purity liquid o n2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air  48  liquid oxygen may also be condensed from air using liquid nitrogen as a coolant  49   oxygen is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials  49   the spectroscopy of molecular oxygen is associated with the atmospheric processes of aurora  airglow and nightglow  50  the absorption in the herzberg continuum and schumann u2013runge bands in the ultraviolet produces atomic oxygen that is important in the chemistry of the middle atmosphere  51  excited state singlet molecular oxygen is responsible for red chemiluminescence in solution  52   naturally occurring oxygen is composed of three stable isotopes  16o  17o  and 18o  with 16o being the most abundant (99.762  natural abundance   53   most 16o is synthesized at the end of the helium fusion process in massive stars but some is made in the neon burning process  54  17o is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the cno cycle  making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars  54  most 18o is produced when 14n  made abundant from cno burning  captures a 4he nucleus  making 18o common in the helium-rich zones of evolved  massive stars  54   fourteen radioisotopes have been characterized  the most stable are 15o with a half-life of 122.24\xa0seconds and 14o with a half-life of 70.606\xa0seconds  53  all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 27\xa0s and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 83\xa0milliseconds  53  the most common decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 16o is \u03b2  decay 55][56][57  to yield nitrogen  and the most common mode for the isotopes heavier than 18o is beta decay to yield fluorine  53   oxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the earth s biosphere  air  sea and land  oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe  after hydrogen and helium  5  about 0.9  of the sun s mass is oxygen  6  oxygen constitutes 49.2  of the earth s crust by mass 7  as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide and is the most abundant element by mass in the earth s crust  it is also the major component of the world s oceans (88.8  by mass   6  oxygen gas is the second most common component of the earth s atmosphere  taking up 20.8  of its volume and 23.1  of its mass  some 1015 tonnes   6][59  d  earth is unusual among the planets of the solar system in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere  mars  with 0.1  o n2 by volume  and venus have much less  the o n2 surrounding those planets is produced solely by ultraviolet radiation on oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon dioxide   the unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on earth is the result of the oxygen cycle  this biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on earth  the atmosphere  the biosphere  and the lithosphere  the main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis  which is responsible for modern earth s atmosphere  photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere  while respiration  decay  and combustion remove it from the atmosphere  in the present equilibrium  production and consumption occur at the same rate of roughly 1/2000th of the entire atmospheric oxygen per year   free oxygen also occurs in solution in the world s water bodies  the increased solubility of o n2 at lower temperatures  see physical properties  has important implications for ocean life  as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content  60  water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce the o n2 content in eutrophic water bodies  scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water s biochemical oxygen demand  or the amount of o n2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration  61   paleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine the climate millions of years ago  see oxygen isotope ratio cycle   seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope  oxygen-16  evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12  heavier oxygen-18  and this disparity increases at lower temperatures  62  during periods of lower global temperatures  snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16  and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18  marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate  62  paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years   planetary geologists have measured the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in samples from the earth  the moon  mars  and meteorites  but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the sun  believed to be the same as those of the primordial solar nebula  analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed genesis spacecraft has shown that the sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the earth  the measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the sun s disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the earth  63   oxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760\xa0nm  some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform  64  this approach exploits the fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation s reflectance from its fluorescence  which is much weaker  the measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation  but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale   in nature  free oxygen is produced by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis  according to some estimates  green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70  of the free oxygen produced on earth  and the rest is produced by terrestrial plants  65  other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher  while some estimates are lower  suggesting oceans produce ~45  of earth s atmospheric oxygen each year  66   a simplified overall formula for photosynthesis is  67   or simply  photolytic oxygen evolution occurs in the thylakoid membranes of photosynthetic organisms and requires the energy of four photons  e  many steps are involved  but the result is the formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane  which is used to synthesize adenosine triphosphate  atp  via photophosphorylation  68  the o n2 remaining  after production of the water molecule  is released into the atmosphere  f   oxygen is used in mitochondria to generate atp during oxidative phosphorylation  the reaction for aerobic respiration is essentially the reverse of photosynthesis and is simplified as   in vertebrates  o n2 diffuses through membranes in the lungs and into red blood cells  hemoglobin binds o n2  changing color from bluish red to bright red 39  (co n2 is released from another part of hemoglobin through the bohr effect   other animals use hemocyanin  molluscs and some arthropods  or hemerythrin  spiders and lobsters   59  a liter of blood can dissolve 200\xa0cm3 of o n2.[59   until the discovery of anaerobic metazoa  69  oxygen was thought to be a requirement for all complex life  70   reactive oxygen species  such as superoxide ion (o u2212\n2  and hydrogen peroxide (h n2o n2   are reactive by-products of oxygen use in organisms  59  parts of the immune system of higher organisms create peroxide  superoxide  and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes  reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack  68  oxygen is damaging to obligately anaerobic organisms  which were the dominant form of early life on earth until o n2 began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago during the great oxygenation event  about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms  71][72   an adult human at rest inhales 1.8 to 2.4\xa0grams of oxygen per minute  73  this amounts to more than 6 billion tonnes of oxygen inhaled by humanity per year  g     the free oxygen partial pressure in the body of a living vertebrate organism is highest in the respiratory system  and decreases along any arterial system  peripheral tissues  and venous system  respectively  partial pressure is the pressure that oxygen would have if it alone occupied the volume  77   free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in earth s atmosphere before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved  probably about 3.5 billion years ago  free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the paleoproterozoic eon  between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago   78  for the first billion years  any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations  when such oxygen sinks became saturated  free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3\u20132.7\xa0billion years ago  reaching 10  of its present level around 1.7\xa0billion years ago  78][79   the presence of large amounts of dissolved and free oxygen in the oceans and atmosphere may have driven most of the extant anaerobic organisms to extinction during the great oxygenation event  oxygen catastrophe  about 2.4 billion years ago  cellular respiration using o n2 enables aerobic organisms to produce much more atp than anaerobic organisms  80  cellular respiration of o n2 occurs in all eukaryotes  including all complex multicellular organisms such as plants and animals   since the beginning of the cambrian period 540 million years ago  atmospheric o n2 levels have fluctuated between 15  and 30  by volume  81  towards the end of the carboniferous period  about 300\xa0million years ago  atmospheric o n2 levels reached a maximum of 35  by volume  81  which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at this time  82   variations of oxygen shaped the climates of the past  when oxygen declined  atmospheric density dropped and this in turn increased surface evaporation  and led to precipitation increases and warmer temperatures  83   at the current rate of photosynthesis it would take about 2,000\xa0years to regenerate the entire o n2 in the present atmosphere  84   one hundred xa0million xa0tonnes of o n2 are extracted from air for industrial uses annually by two primary methods  18  the most common method is fractional distillation of liquefied air  with n n2 distilling as a vapor while o n2 is left as a liquid  18   the other primary method of producing o n2 is passing a stream of clean  dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves  which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90%\xa0to xa093  o n2.[18  simultaneously  nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed  by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it  in the reverse direction of flow  after a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged  thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline  this is known as pressure swing adsorption  oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies  see also the related vacuum swing adsorption   85   oxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen  dc electricity must be used  if ac is used  the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1  contrary to popular belief  the 2:1 ratio observed in the dc electrolysis of acidified water does not prove that the empirical formula of water is h2o unless certain assumptions are made about the molecular formulae of hydrogen and oxygen themselves  a similar method is the electrocatalytic o n2 evolution from oxides and oxoacids  chemical catalysts can be used as well  such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines  and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies  another air separation method is forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxide by either high pressure or an electric current  to produce nearly pure o n2 gas  61   in large quantities  the price of liquid oxygen in 2001 was approximately $0.21/kg  86  since the primary cost of production is the energy cost of liquefying the air  the production cost will change as energy cost varies   oxygen storage methods include high pressure oxygen tanks  cryogenics and chemical compounds  for reasons of economy  oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers  since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840\xa0liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20\xa0\xb0c (68\xa0\xb0f   18  such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers  which stand outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure oxygen gas  liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers  which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building  oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas  a form that is useful in certain portable medical applications and oxy-fuel welding and cutting  18   uptake of o n2 from the air is the essential purpose of respiration  so oxygen supplementation is used in medicine  treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient s blood  but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs  easing work load on the heart  oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema  pneumonia  some heart disorders  congestive heart failure   some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure  and any disease that impairs the body s ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen  87   treatments are flexible enough to be used in hospitals  the patient s home  or increasingly by portable devices  oxygen tents were once commonly used in oxygen supplementation  but have since been replaced mostly by the use of oxygen masks or nasal cannulas  88   hyperbaric  high-pressure  medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of o n2 around the patient and  when needed  the medical staff  89  carbon monoxide poisoning  gas gangrene  and decompression sickness  the  bends   are sometimes addressed with this therapy  90  increased o n2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin  91][92  oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene  so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them  93][94  decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive  resulting in bubbles of inert gas  mostly nitrogen and helium  forming in the blood  increasing the pressure of o n2 as soon as possible helps to redissolve the bubbles back into the blood so that these excess gasses can be exhaled naturally through the lungs  87][95][96   oxygen is also used for people who require mechanical ventilation  often at concentrations above the 21  found in ambient air   an application of o n2 as a low-pressure breathing gas is in modern space suits  which surround their occupant s body with pressurized air  these devices use nearly pure oxygen at about one third normal pressure  resulting in a normal blood partial pressure of o n2.[97][98  this trade-off of higher oxygen concentration for lower pressure is needed to maintain suit flexibility   scuba divers and submariners also rely on artificially delivered o n2  but most often use normal pressure  and or mixtures of oxygen and air  pure or nearly pure o n2 use in diving at higher-than-sea-level pressures is usually limited to rebreather  decompression  or emergency treatment use at relatively shallow depths (~6 meters depth  or less   99][100  deeper diving requires significant dilution of o n2 with other gases  such as nitrogen or helium  to prevent oxygen toxicity  99   people who climb mountains or fly in non-pressurized fixed-wing aircraft sometimes have supplemental o n2 supplies  h  pressurized commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of o n2 automatically supplied to the passengers in case of cabin depressurization  sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat  causing oxygen masks to drop  pulling on the masks  to start the flow of oxygen  as cabin safety instructions dictate  forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister  61  a steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction   oxygen  as a supposed mild euphoric  has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars and in sports  oxygen bars are establishments found in japan  california  and las vegas  nevada since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal o n2 exposure for a fee  101  professional athletes  especially in american football  sometimes go off-field between plays to don oxygen masks to boost performance  the pharmacological effect is doubted  a placebo effect is a more likely explanation  101  available studies support a performance boost from enriched o n2 mixtures only if it is breathed during aerobic exercise  102   other recreational uses that do not involve breathing include pyrotechnic applications  such as george goble s five-second ignition of barbecue grills  103   smelting of iron ore into steel consumes 55  of commercially produced oxygen  61  in this process  o n2 is injected through a high-pressure lance into molten iron  which removes sulfur impurities and excess carbon as the respective oxides  so n2 and co n2  the reactions are exothermic  so the temperature increases to 1,700\xa0\xb0c  61   another 25  of commercially produced oxygen is used by the chemical industry  61  ethylene is reacted with o n2 to create ethylene oxide  which  in turn  is converted into ethylene glycol  the primary feeder material used to manufacture a host of products  including antifreeze and polyester polymers  the precursors of many plastics and fabrics   61   most of the remaining 20  of commercially produced oxygen is used in medical applications  metal cutting and welding  as an oxidizer in rocket fuel  and in water treatment  61  oxygen is used in oxyacetylene welding burning acetylene with o n2 to produce a very hot flame  in this process  metal up to 60\xa0cm (24\xa0in  thick is first heated with a small oxy-acetylene flame and then quickly cut by a large stream of o n2.[104   the oxidation state of oxygen is \u22122 in almost all known compounds of oxygen  the oxidation state \u22121 is found in a few compounds such as peroxides  105  compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon  \u22121/2  superoxides   \u22121/3  ozonides   0  elemental  hypofluorous acid   +1/2  dioxygenyl   +1  dioxygen difluoride   and +2  oxygen difluoride    water (h n2o  is an oxide of hydrogen and the most familiar oxygen compound  hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction  about 23.3\xa0kj xb7mol u22121 per hydrogen atom  to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule  106  these hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them approximately 15  closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just van der waals forces  107  i   due to its electronegativity  oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides  the surface of most metals  such as aluminium and titanium  are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion  many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds  with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show  for example  the mineral feo  w xfcstite  is written as fe n1\xa0\u2212\xa0xo  where x is usually around 0.05.[108   oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace

particular various complex silicates  in silicate minerals   the earth s mantle  of much larger mass than the crust  is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron   water-soluble silicates in the form of na n4sio n4  na n2sio n3  and na n2si n2o n5 are used as detergents and adhesives  109   oxygen also acts as a ligand for transition metals  forming transition metal dioxygen complexes  which feature metal u2013o n2  this class of compounds includes the heme proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin  110  an exotic and unusual reaction occurs with ptf n6  which oxidizes oxygen to give o2+ptf6\u2212.[111   among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are  where  r  is an organic group   alcohols  r-oh   ethers  r-o-r   ketones  r-co-r   aldehydes  r-co-h   carboxylic acids  r-cooh   esters  r-coo-r   acid anhydrides  r-co-o-co-r   and amides (r-c o -nr n2   there are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen  including  acetone  methanol

synthesis of many different substances  other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are  glycerol  formaldehyde  glutaraldehyde  citric acid  acetic anhydride  and acetamide  epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms   oxygen reacts spontaneously with many organic compounds at or below room temperature in a process called autoxidation  112  most of the organic compounds that contain oxygen are not made by direct action of o n2  organic compounds important in industry and commerce that are made by direct oxidation of a precursor include ethylene oxide and peracetic acid  109   the element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important to  or generated by  life  only a few common complex biomolecules  such as squalene and the carotenes  contain no oxygen  of the organic compounds with biological relevance  carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen  all fats  fatty acids  amino acids  and proteins contain oxygen  due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these acids and their ester residues   oxygen also occurs in phosphate (po3\u2212\n4  groups in the biologically important energy-carrying molecules atp and adp  in the backbone and the purines  except adenine  and pyrimidines of rna and dna  and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite   the nfpa 704 standard rates compressed oxygen gas as nonhazardous to health  nonflammable and nonreactive  but an oxidizer  refrigerated liquid oxygen  lox  is given a health hazard rating of 3  for increased risk of hyperoxia from condensed vapors  and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite   and all other ratings are the same as the compressed gas form   oxygen gas (o n2  can be toxic at elevated partial pressures  leading to convulsions and other health problems  99][j  114  oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals xa0 kpa   equal to about 50  oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times the normal sea-level o n2 partial pressure of about 21\xa0kpa  this is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators  since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30%\u201350  o n2 by volume  about 30\xa0kpa at standard pressure   15   although this figure also is subject to wide variation  depending on type of mask    at one time  premature babies were placed in incubators containing o n2-rich air  but this practice was discontinued after some babies were blinded by the oxygen content being too high  15   breathing pure o n2 in space applications  such as in some modern space suits  or in early spacecraft such as apollo  causes no damage due to the low total pressures used  97][115  in the case of spacesuits  the o n2 partial pressure in the breathing gas is  in general  about 30\xa0kpa (1.4 times normal   and the resulting o n2 partial pressure in the astronaut s arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level o n2 partial pressure  for more information on this  see space suit and arterial blood gas    oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving  15][99  prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an o n2 partial pressure more than 60\xa0kpa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis  116  exposure to a o n2 partial pressures greater than 160\xa0kpa  about 1.6 atm  may lead to convulsions  normally fatal for divers   acute oxygen toxicity  causing seizures  its most feared effect for divers  can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21  o n2 at 66\xa0m (217\xa0ft  or more of depth  the same thing can occur by breathing 100  o n2 at only 6\xa0m (20\xa0ft   116][117][118][119   highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion  fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity  an ignition event  such as heat or a spark  is needed to trigger combustion  31][120  oxygen is the oxidant  not the fuel  but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion  31][38  combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential  such as peroxides  chlorates  nitrates  perchlorates  and dichromates because they can donate oxygen to a fire   concentrated o n2 will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically  120  steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel  and therefore the design and manufacture of o n2 systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized  120  the fire that killed the apollo 1 crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure o n2 but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure  instead of the \u200a1\u20443 normal pressure that would be used in a mission  k  122   liquid oxygen spills  if allowed to soak into organic matter  such as wood  petrochemicals  and asphalt can cause these materials to detonate unpredictably on subsequent mechanical impact  120  as with other cryogenic liquids  on contact with the human body it can cause frostbites to the skin and the eyes
