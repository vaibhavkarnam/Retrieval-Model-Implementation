japan to open to the west  after nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection  the imperial court regained its political power in 1868 through the help of several clans from ch u014dsh u016b and satsuma  and the empire of japan was established  in the late 19th and early 20th centuries  victories in the first sino-japanese war  the russo-japanese war and world war i allowed japan to

include okinawa  are a chain to the south of kyushu  together they are often known as the japanese archipelago  71   about 73 percent of japan is forested  mountainous  and unsuitable for agricultural  industrial  or residential use  8][72  as a result  the habitable zones  mainly located in coastal areas  have extremely high population densities  japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world  73   the islands of japan are located in a volcanic zone on the pacific ring of fire  they are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-silurian to the pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the philippine sea plate beneath the continental amurian plate and okinawa plate to the south  and subduction of the pacific plate under the okhotsk plate to the north  the boso triple junction off the coast of japan is a triple junction where the north american plate  the pacific plate and the philippine sea plate meets  japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the eurasian continent  the subducting plates pulled japan eastward  opening the sea of japan around 15 million years ago  74   japan has 108 active volcanoes  during the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged  including sh u014dwa-shinzan on hokkaido and my u014djin-sh u014d off the bayonnaise rocks in the

inland sea  pacific ocean  and ryukyu islands  the northernmost zone  hokkaido  has a humid continental climate with long  cold winters and very warm to cool summers  precipitation is not heavy  but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter  80   in the sea of japan zone on honshu s west coast  northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall  in the summer  the region is cooler than the pacific area  though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn  the central highland has a typical inland humid continental climate  with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons  as well as large diurnal variation  precipitation is light  though winters are usually snowy  the mountains of the ch u016bgoku and shikoku regions shelter the seto inland sea from seasonal winds  bringing mild weather year-round  80   the pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot  humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind  the ryukyu islands have a subtropical climate  with warm winters and hot summers  precipitation is very heavy  especially during the rainy season  80   the average winter temperature in japan is 5.1\xa0\xb0c (41.2\xa0\xb0f  and the average summer temperature is 25.2\xa0\xb0c (77.4\xa0\xb0f   81  the highest temperature ever

hokkaido in late july  in most of honshu  the rainy season begins before the middle of june and lasts about six weeks  in late summer and early autumn  typhoons often bring heavy rain  83   japan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands  they range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the ry u016bky u016b and bonin islands  to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands  to temperate coniferous forests in the cold  winter portions of the northern islands  84  japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife

widespread in the 1950s and 1960s  responding to rising concern about the problem  the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970.[89  the oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of japan s lack of natural resources  90  current environmental issues include urban air pollution  nox  suspended particulate matter  and toxics   waste management
