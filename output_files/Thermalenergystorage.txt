Thermalenergystorage
 thermal energy storage  tes  is achieved with greatly differing technologies that collectively accommodate a wide range of needs  it allows excess thermal energy to be collected for later use  hours  days or many months later  at individual building  multiuser building  district  town  or even regional scale depending on the specific technology  as examples  energy demand can be balanced between daytime and nighttime  summer heat from solar collectors can be stored interseasonally for use in winter  and cold obtained from winter air can be provided for summer air conditioning  storage media include  water or ice-slush tanks ranging from small to massive  masses of native earth or bedrock accessed with heat exchangers in clusters of small-diameter boreholes  sometimes quite deep   deep aquifers contained between impermeable strata  shallow  lined pits filled with gravel and water and top-insulated  and eutectic  phase-change materials   other sources of thermal energy for storage include heat or cold produced with heat pumps from off-peak  lower cost electric power  a practice called peak shaving  heat from combined heat and power  chp  power plants  heat produced by renewable electrical energy that exceeds grid demand and waste heat from industrial processes  heat storage  both seasonal and short term  is considered an important means for cheaply balancing high shares of variable renewable electricity production and integration of electricity and heating sectors in energy systems almost or completely fed by renewable energy  1][2][3       most practical active solar heating systems provide storage from a few hours to a day s worth of energy collected  however  there are a growing number of facilities that use seasonal thermal energy storage  stes   enabling solar energy to be stored in summer for space heating use during winter  4][5][6  the drake landing solar community in alberta  canada  has now achieved a year-round 97  solar heating fraction  a world record made possible only by incorporating stes  4][7   the use of both latent heat and sensible heat are also possible with high temperature solar thermal input  various eutectic mixtures of metals  such as aluminium and silicon (alsi12  offer a high melting point suited to efficient steam generation  8  while high alumina cement-based materials offer good thermal storage capabilities  9   molten salt is a means of storing heat at a high temperature  this is a current commercial technology used in conjunction with concentrated solar power for later use in electricity generation  to allow solar power to provide electricity on a more continuous basis  these molten salts  potassium nitrate  calcium nitrate  sodium nitrate  lithium nitrate  etc   have the property to absorb and store the heat energy that is released to the water  to transfer energy when needed  to improve the salt properties it must be mixed in a eutectic mixture  citation needed   molten salt can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant  so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night  it was demonstrated in the solar two project from 1995-1999  the system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99   a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity  versus converting heat directly into electricity  10][11][12  the molten salt mixtures vary  the most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate  potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate  it is non-flammable and nontoxic  and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid  so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications   the salt melts at 131\xa0\xb0c (268\xa0\xb0f   it is kept liquid at 288\xa0\xb0c (550\xa0\xb0f  in an insulated  cold  storage tank  the liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused sun heats it to 566\xa0\xb0c (1,051\xa0\xb0f   it is then sent to a hot storage tank  this is so well insulated that the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week  13   when electricity is needed  the hot salt is pumped to a conventional steam-generator to produce superheated steam for a turbine generator as used in any conventional coal  oil  or nuclear power plant  a 100-megawatt turbine would need a tank of about 9.1 metres (30\xa0ft  tall and 24 metres (79\xa0ft  in diameter to drive it for four hours by this design   several parabolic trough power plants in spain 14  and solar power tower developer solarreserve use this thermal energy storage concept  the solana generating station in the u s  has 6 hours of storage by molten salt  during the summer of 2013 the gemasolar thermosolar solar power tower molten salt plant in spain achieved a first by continuously producing electricity 24 hours per day for 36 days  15   a steam accumulator consists of an insulated steel pressure tank containing hot water and steam under pressure  as a heat storage device  it is used to mediate heat production by a variable or steady source from a variable demand for heat  steam accumulators may take on a significance for energy storage in solar thermal energy projects   large stores are widely used in scandinavia to store heat for several days  to decouple heat and power production and to help meet peak demands  interseasonal storage in caverns has been investigated and appears to be economical  16   water has one of the highest thermal capacities heat capacity - 4.2\u202fj  cm xb3\xb7k  whereas concrete has about one third of that  on the other hand  concrete can be heated to much higher temperatures \u2013 1200\xa0\xb0c by e g  electrical heating and therefore has a much higher overall volumetric capacity  thus in the example below  an insulated cube of about 2.8\u202fm would appear to provide sufficient storage for a single house to meet 50  of heating demand  this could  in principle  be used to store surplus wind or pv heat due to the ability of electrical heating to reach high temperatures  at the neighborhood level  the wiggenhausen-s xfcd solar development at friedrichshafen has received international attention  this features a 12,000\u202fm xb3 (420,000\u202fcu u202fft  reinforced concrete thermal store linked to 4,300\u202fm xb2 (46,000\u202fsq u202fft  of solar collectors  which will supply the 570 houses with around 50  of their heating and hot water  siemens builds a 36 mwh thermal storage near hamburg with 600\xa0\xb0c basalt and 1.5 mw electric output  17  a similar system is scheduled for sor xf8  denmark  with 41-58  of the stored 18 mwh heat returned for the town s district heating  and 30-41  returned as electricity  18   miscibility gap alloys rely on the phase change of a metallic material  see  latent heat  to store thermal energy  19   rather than pumping the liquid metal between tanks as in a molten salt system  the metal is encapsulated in another metallic material that it cannot alloy with  immiscible   depending on the two materials selected  the phase changing material and the encapsulating material  storage densities can be between 0.2 and 2 mj l   a working fluid  typically water or steam  is used to transfer the heat into and out of the mga  thermal conductivity of mgas is often higher  up to 400 w m k  than competing technologies 20][21  which means quicker  charge  and  discharge  of the thermal storage is possible  the technology has not yet been implemented on a large scale   storage heaters are commonplace in european homes with time of use metering  they consist of high-density ceramic bricks or feolite blocks heated to a high temperature with electricity  and may or may not have good insulation and controls to release heat over a number of hours  22   air conditioning can be provided more economically by using cheaper electricity at night to freeze water into ice  then using the cool of the ice in the afternoon to reduce the electricity needed to handle air conditioning demands  thermal energy storage using ice makes use of the large heat of fusion of water  one metric ton of water  one cubic meter  can store 334 million joules  mj  or 317,000 btus (93kwh or 26.4 ton-hours   in fact  ice was originally transported from mountains to cities for use as a coolant  and the original definition of a  ton  of cooling capacity  heat flow  was the heat to melt one ton of ice every 24 hours  this is the heat flow one would expect in a 3,000-square-foot (280\xa0m2  house in boston in the summer  this definition has since been replaced by less archaic units  one ton hvac capacity   12,000 btu hour (~3.5\xa0kw   either way  an agreeably small storage facility can hold enough ice to cool a large building for a day or a week  whether that ice is produced by anhydrous ammonia chillers or hauled in by horse-drawn carts  citation needed   as such there are developing and developed applications where ice is produced during off-peak periods and used for cooling at later time  citation needed   in addition to using ice in cooling applications it is also being used in heat pump based heating systems  in these applications the phase change energy provides a very significant layer of thermal capacity that is near the bottom range of temperature that water source heat pumps can operate in  this allows the system to ride out the heaviest heating load conditions and extends the timeframe by which the source energy elements can contribute heat back into the system  citation needed   this uses liquification of air or nitrogen as an energy store   a pilot cryogenic energy system that uses liquid air as the energy store  and low-grade waste heat to drive the thermal re-expansion of the air  has been operating at a power station in slough  uk since 2010.[23   solid or molten silicon offers much higher storage temperatures than salts with consequent greater capacity and efficiency  it is being researched as a possible more energy efficient storage technology  silicon is able to store more than 1mwh of energy per cubic metre at 1400\xa0\xb0c  24][25   in pumped-heat electricity storage  phes   a reversible heat-pump system is used to store energy as a temperature difference between two heat stores  26][27][28   one system which was being developed by the now bankrupt uk company isentropic operates as follows  29  it comprises two insulated containers filled with crushed rock or gravel  a hot vessel storing thermal energy at high temperature and high pressure  and a cold vessel storing thermal energy at low temperature and low pressure  the vessels are connected at top and bottom by pipes and the whole system is filled with the inert gas argon   during the charging cycle the system uses off-peak electricity to work as a heat pump  argon at ambient temperature and pressure from the top of the cold store is compressed adiabatically to a pressure of 12 bar  heating it to around 500\xa0\xb0c (900\xa0\xb0f   the compressed gas is transferred to the top of the hot vessel where it percolates down through the gravel  transferring its heat to the rock and cooling to ambient temperature  the cooled  but still pressurized  gas emerging at the bottom of the vessel is then expanded  again adiabatically  back down to 1 bar  which lowers its temperature to -150\xa0\xb0c  the cold gas is then passed up through the cold vessel where it cools the rock while being warmed back to its initial condition   the energy is recovered as electricity by reversing the cycle  the hot gas from the hot vessel is expanded to drive a generator and then supplied to the cold store  the cooled gas retrieved from the bottom of the cold store is compressed which heats the gas to ambient temperature  the gas is then transferred to the bottom of the hot vessel to be reheated   the compression and expansion processes are provided by a specially designed reciprocating machine using sliding valves  surplus heat generated by inefficiencies in the process is shed to the environment through heat exchangers during the discharging cycle  26][29   the developer claims that a round trip efficiency of 72-80  is achievable  26][29  this compares to &gt 80  achievable with pumped hydro energy storage  27   another proposed system uses turbomachinery and is capable of operating at much higher power levels  28   the system works by storing heat in a container containing 50 percent sodium hydroxide  naoh  solution  heat is stored by heating the solution  using a solar collector on a rooftop or any other hear source  and evaporating the water in an endothermic reaction  when water is added again heat is released in an exothermic reaction at 50\xa0\xb0c (120\xa0\xb0f   current systems operate at 60  efficiency  energy stored in such a matter can last from a few months to years  the solution can also be transported to other location  30   in 2013 the dutch technology developer tno launched the results of a project to store heat in a salt container  the heat  which can be derived from a solar collector on a rooftop  expels the water contained in the salt  when the water is added again  the heat is released  with almost no energy losses  a container with a few cubic meters of salt could store enough of this thermochemical energy to heat a house throughout the winter  in a temperate climate like that of the netherlands  currently researchers in several countries are conducting experiments to determine the best type of salt  or salt mixture  low pressure within the container seems favourable for the energy transport  31   storing energy in molecular bonds is being investigated  energy densities equivalent to lithium-ion batteries have been achieved  32
