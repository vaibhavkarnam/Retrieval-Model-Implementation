NellisSolarPowerPlant
 the nellis solar power plant is a 14-megawatt  mw  photovoltaic power station located within nellis air force base in clark county  nevada  northeast of las vegas  the power plant was inaugurated in a ceremony on december xa017  2007  with nevada governor jim gibbons activating its full operation  on average  it has since generated 32\xa0gigawatt-hours of electricity annually and supplied more than 25  of the power used at the base  1][2][3   occupying 140 acres (57\xa0ha  of land leased from the air force at the northeastern corner of the base  this ground-mounted solar system employs an advanced sun tracking system  designed and deployed by sunpower  the system contains approximately 70,000 solar panels  and the peak power generation capacity of the plant is approximately 13\xa0mwac  1  this means the ratio of average to peak output  or capacity factor  of this plant is around 22    the energy generated will support more than 12,000 military and civilians at nellis who are responsible for air force advanced combat training  tactics development and operational testing  construction began on april xa023  2007,[1  and operation of the first 5\xa0mw began on october 12  2007.[4][5       under the terms of the power purchase agreement  mma renewable ventures  who own the panels  is leasing the land at no cost and nellis is agreeing to buy the power for 20\xa0years at about 2.2\xa0cents kw xb7h  instead of the 9\xa0cents they are paying to nevada power  saving the air force $1 million each year  none of the $100\xa0million cost came from the air force  but instead from subsidizing taxpayers and nevada power customers who are paying for the rps credits  6   the partners were able to build the plant  recover costs and produce electricity at a savings  because of the fairly complex financing structure arranged among mma  its investors  nevada power  and nellis \u2014 in addition to multimillion-dollar government incentives  7   the plant was expected to produce 30 gwh per year but actually produced about 32\xa0gwh the first year  8  more than expected  8  saving the air force $1.2 million in the first year of operation  9   there is no provision for operation during a power failure  when the base reverts to generator power  this would require limiting the output to less than or equal to what the generators can provide  otherwise a cloud could pass over and cause the sudden drop in output to overload the generators  causing them to trip off  if a pumped-hydro facility was added in the nearby hills  that would allow the base to operate during power failures under solar power  although batteries would also be needed to allow time for the hydro-electric plant to adjust to the load requirements  10   nellis consists of 5,821 tilted axis  t20 single axis trackers made by sunpower  and uses 72,416 solar panels  each 200 watts  11  and 54 xantrex  schneider electric  gt 250 inverters  12  each rated 250\xa0kw  the maximum output is therefore inverter limited to 13.5 megawatts  ac   at full output  the inverters are 96  efficient  approximately 10  of the panels are mounted on north-south oriented horizontal single axis trackers  about one third of the solar panels were made by suntech power  the lead supplier  13   in 1999  nevada passed a renewable portfolio standard  rps  as part of their 1997 electric restructuring legislation (ab xa0366   it required any electric providers in the state to acquire actual renewable electric generation or purchase renewable energy credits so that each utility had 1\xa0percent of total consumption in renewables  however  on june xa08  2001  nevada governor kenny guinn signed sb xa0372  at the time the country s most aggressive renewable portfolio standard  the law requires that 15\xa0percent of all electricity generated in nevada be derived from new renewables by the year 2013.[14   the 2001  revision to the rps keeps in place nevada s commitment to expand solar energy resources by requiring that at least 5\xa0percent of the renewable energy projects must generate electricity from solar energy  14   in june 2005  the nevada legislature passed a bill during a special legislative session that modified the nevada rps  assembly bill 03   the bill extends the deadline and raised the requirements of the rps to 20\xa0percent of sales by 2015.[14   an extension of the plant called nellis solar pv ii  15  which will generate another 15 megawatts of power  began construction on march 24  2015,[16  and was completed in february 2016.[17   president barack obama visited the facility and addressed an audience of more than 450 people on may 27  2009.[18][19
