Powerflowstudy
 in power engineering  the power-flow study  or load-flow study  is a numerical analysis of the flow of electric power in an interconnected system  a power-flow study usually uses simplified notations such as a one-line diagram and per-unit system  and focuses on various aspects of ac power parameters  such as voltages  voltage angles  real power and reactive power  it analyzes the power systems in normal steady-state operation   power-flow or load-flow studies are important for planning future expansion of power systems as well as in determining the best operation of existing systems  the principal information obtained from the power-flow study is the magnitude and phase angle of the voltage at each bus  and the real and reactive power flowing in each line   commercial power systems are usually too complex to allow for hand solution of the power flow  special purpose network analyzers were built between 1929 and the early 1960s to provide laboratory-scale physical models of power systems  large-scale digital computers replaced the analog methods with numerical solutions   in addition to a power-flow study  computer programs perform related calculations such as short-circuit fault analysis  stability studies  transient and steady-state   unit commitment and economic dispatch  1  in particular  some programs use linear programming to find the optimal power flow  the conditions which give the lowest cost per kilowatt hour delivered   a load flow study is especially valuable for a system with multiple load centers  such as a refinery complex  the power flow study is an analysis of the system u2019s capability to adequately supply the connected load  the total system losses  as well as individual line losses  also are tabulated  transformer tap positions are selected to ensure the correct voltage at critical locations such as motor control centers  performing a load flow study on an existing system provides insight and recommendations as to the system operation and optimization of control settings to obtain maximum capacity while minimizing the operating costs  the results of such an analysis are in terms of active power  reactive power  magnitude and phase angle  furthermore  power-flow computations are crucial for optimal operations of groups of generating units   the open energy modelling initiative promotes open source load-flow models and other types of energy system models       an alternating current power-flow model is a model used in electrical engineering to analyze power grids  it provides a nonlinear system which describes the energy flow through each transmission line  the problem is non-linear because the power flow into load impedances is a function of the square of the applied voltages  due to nonlinearity  in many cases the analysis of large network via ac power-flow model is not feasible  and a linear  but less accurate  dc power-flow model is used instead   usually analysis of a three-phase system is simplified by assuming balanced loading of all three phases  steady-state operation is assumed  with no transient changes in power flow or voltage due to load or generation changes  the system frequency is also assumed to be constant  a further simplification is to use the per-unit system to represent all voltages  power flows  and impedances  scaling the actual target system values to some convenient base  a system one-line diagram is the basis to build a mathematical model of the generators  loads  buses  and transmission lines of the system  and their electrical impedances and ratings   the goal of a power-flow study is to obtain complete voltages angle and magnitude information for each bus in a power system for specified load and generator real power and voltage conditions  2  once this information is known  real and reactive power flow on each branch as well as generator reactive power output can be analytically determined  due to the nonlinear nature of this problem  numerical methods are employed to obtain a solution that is within an acceptable tolerance   the solution to the power-flow problem begins with identifying the known and unknown variables in the system  the known and unknown variables are dependent on the type of bus  a bus without any generators connected to it is called a load bus  with one exception  a bus with at least one generator connected to it is called a generator bus  the exception is one arbitrarily-selected bus that has a generator  this bus is referred to as the slack bus   in the power-flow problem  it is assumed that the real power pd and reactive power qd at each load bus are known  for this reason  load buses are also known as pq buses  for generator buses  it is assumed that the real power generated pg and the voltage magnitude  v  is known  for the slack bus  it is assumed that the voltage magnitude  v  and voltage phase \u0398 are known  therefore  for each load bus  both the voltage magnitude and angle are unknown and must be solved for  for each generator bus  the voltage angle must be solved for  there are no variables that must be solved for the slack bus  in a system with n buses and r generators  there are then \n n n n2\n  nn n u2212\n1\n  n u2212\n  nr n u2212\n1 n  n n n   displaystyle 2(n-1)- r-1   n n unknowns   in order to solve for the \n n n n2\n  nn n u2212\n1\n  n u2212\n  nr n u2212\n1 n  n n n   displaystyle 2(n-1)- r-1   n n unknowns  there must be \n n n n2\n  nn n u2212\n1\n  n u2212\n  nr n u2212\n1 n  n n n   displaystyle 2(n-1)- r-1   n n equations that do not introduce any new unknown variables  the possible equations to use are power balance equations  which can be written for real and reactive power for each bus  the real power balance equation is   where  n n n n np n ni n n n n n   displaystyle p  i   n n is the net active power injected at bus i   n n n n ng n ni nk n n n n n   displaystyle g  ik   n n is the real part of the element in the bus admittance matrix ybus corresponding to the ith row and kth column   n n n n nb n ni nk n n n n n   displaystyle b  ik   n n is the imaginary part of the element in the ybus corresponding to the ith row and kth column and \n n n n n u03b8 n ni nk n n n n n   displaystyle   theta   ik   n n is the difference in voltage angle between the ith and kth buses (\n n n n n u03b8\n ni nk n n n  n n

 i   n n is the net reactive power injected at bus i   equations included are the real and reactive power balance equations for each load bus and the real power balance equation for each generator bus  only the real power balance equation is written for a generator bus because the net reactive power injected is assumed to be unknown and therefore including the reactive power balance equation would result in an additional unknown variable  for similar reasons  there are no equations written for the slack bus   in many transmission systems  the voltage angles \n n n n n u03b8 n ni nk n n n n n   displaystyle   theta   ik   n n are usually relatively small  there is thus a strong coupling between real power and voltage angle  and between reactive power and voltage magnitude  while the coupling between real power and voltage magnitude  as well as reactive power and voltage angle  is weak  as a result  real power is usually transmitted from the bus with higher voltage angle to the bus with lower voltage angle  and reactive power is usually transmitted from the bus with higher voltage magnitude to the bus with lower voltage magnitude  however  this approximation does not hold when the voltage angle is very large  3   there are several different methods of solving the resulting nonlinear system of equations  the most popular is known as the newton u2013raphson method  this method begins with initial guesses of all unknown variables  voltage magnitude and angles at load buses and voltage angles at generator buses   next  a taylor series is written  with the higher order terms ignored  for each of the power balance equations included in the system of equations   the result is a linear system of equations that can be expressed as   where \n n n n u0394 np n n n

linearized system of equations is solved to determine the next guess  m   1  of voltage magnitude and angles based on   the process continues until a stopping condition is met  a common stopping condition is to terminate if the norm of the mismatch equations is below a specified tolerance   a rough outline of solution of the power-flow problem is
