Oilshale
 oil shale is an organic-rich fine-grained sedimentary rock containing kerogen  a solid mixture of organic chemical compounds  from which liquid hydrocarbons called shale oil  not to be confused with tight oil u2014crude oil occurring naturally in shales  can be produced  shale oil is a substitute for conventional crude oil  however  extracting shale oil from oil shale is more costly than the production of conventional crude oil both financially and in terms of its environmental impact  1  deposits of oil shale occur around the world  including major deposits in the united states  estimates of global deposits range from 4.8 to 5 trillion barrels (760\xd710^9 to 790\xd710^9\xa0m3  of oil in place  2][3   heating oil shale to a sufficiently high temperature causes the chemical process of pyrolysis to yield a vapor  upon cooling the vapor  the liquid shale oil u2014an unconventional oil u2014is separated from combustible oil-shale gas  the term shale gas can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales   oil shale can also be burned directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for power generation and district heating or used as a raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing  4   oil shale gains attention as a potential abundant source of oil whenever the price of crude oil rises  5][6  at the same time  oil-shale mining and processing raise a number of environmental concerns  such as land use  waste disposal  water use  waste-water management  greenhouse-gas emissions and air pollution  7][8  estonia and china have well-established oil shale industries  and brazil  germany  and russia also utilize oil shale  9   general composition of oil shales constitutes inorganic matrix  bitumens  and kerogen  oil shales differ from oil-bearing shales  shale deposits that contain petroleum  tight oil  that is sometimes produced from drilled wells  examples of oil-bearing shales are the bakken formation  pierre shale  niobrara formation  and eagle ford formation       oil shale  an organic-rich sedimentary rock  belongs to the group of sapropel fuels  10  it does not have a definite geological definition nor a specific chemical formula  and its seams do not always have discrete boundaries  oil shales vary considerably in their mineral content  chemical composition  age  type of kerogen  and depositional history and not all oil shales would necessarily be classified as shales in the strict sense  11][12  according to the petrologist adrian c  hutton of the university of wollongong  oil shales are not  geological nor geochemically distinctive rock but rather  economic  term   13  their common defining feature is low solubility in low-boiling organic solvents and generation of liquid organic products on thermal decomposition  14   oil shale differs from bitumen-impregnated rocks  oil sands and petroleum reservoir rocks   humic coals and carbonaceous shale  while oil sands do originate from the biodegradation of oil  heat and pressure have not  yet  transformed the kerogen in oil shale into petroleum  that means that its maturation does not exceed early mesocatagenetic  14][15][16   general composition of oil shales constitutes inorganic matrix  bitumens  and kerogen  while the bitumen portion of oil shales is soluble in carbon disulfide  kerogen portion is insoluble in carbon disulfide and can contain iron  vanadium  nickel  molybdenum  and uranium  17  oil shale contains a lower percentage of organic matter than coal  in commercial grades of oil shale the ratio of organic matter to mineral matter lies approximately between 0.75:5 and 1.5:5  at the same time  the organic matter in oil shale has an atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon  h c  approximately 1.2 to 1.8\xa0times lower than for crude oil and about 1.5 to 3\xa0times higher than for coals  10][18][19  the organic components of oil shale derive from a variety of organisms  such as the remains of algae  spores  pollen  plant cuticles and corky fragments of herbaceous and woody plants  and cellular debris from other aquatic and land plants  18][20  some deposits contain significant fossils  germany s messel pit has the status of a unesco world heritage site  the mineral matter in oil shale includes various fine-grained silicates and carbonates  4][10  inorganic matrix can contain quartz  feldspars  clays  mainly illite and chlorite   carbonates  calcite and dolomites   pyrite and some other minerals  17   geologists can classify oil shales on the basis of their composition as carbonate-rich shales  siliceous shales  or cannel shales  21   another classification  known as the van krevelen diagram  assigns kerogen types  depending on the hydrogen  carbon  and oxygen content of oil shales  original organic matter  12  the most commonly used classification of oil shales  developed between 1987 and 1991 by adrian c  hutton  adapts petrographic terms from coal terminology  this classification designates oil shales as terrestrial  lacustrine  lake-bottom-deposited   or marine  ocean bottom-deposited   based on the environment of the initial biomass deposit  4][22  known oil shales are predominantly aquatic  marine  lacustrine  origin  14][22  hutton s classification scheme has proven useful in estimating the yield and composition of the extracted oil  23   as source rocks for most conventional oil reservoirs  oil shale deposits are found in all world oil provinces  although most of them are too deep to be exploited economically  3  as with all oil and gas resources  analysts distinguish between oil shale resources and oil shale reserves   resources  refers to all oil shale deposits  while  reserves   represents those deposits from which producers can extract oil shale economically using existing technology  since extraction technologies develop continuously  planners can only estimate the amount of recoverable kerogen  1][4  although resources of oil shale occur in many countries  only 33\xa0countries possess known deposits of possible economic value .[24][25  well-explored deposits  potentially classifiable as reserves  include the green river deposits in the western united states  the tertiary deposits in queensland  australia  deposits in sweden and estonia  the el-lajjun deposit in jordan  and deposits in france  germany  brazil  china  southern mongolia and russia  these deposits have given rise to expectations of yielding at least 40\xa0liters of shale oil per tonne of oil shale  using the fischer assay  4][12   a 2008 estimate set the total world resources of oil shale at 689\xa0gigatons xa0\u2014 equivalent to yield of 4.8 trillion barrels (760\xa0billion cubic metres  of shale oil  with the largest reserves in the united states  which is thought to have 3.7 trillion barrels (590\xa0billion cubic metres   though only a part of it is recoverable  2  according to the 2010 world energy outlook by the international energy agency  the world oil shale resources may be equivalent of more than 5 trillion barrels (790\xa0billion cubic metres  of oil in place of which more than 1 trillion barrels (160\xa0billion cubic metres  may be technically recoverable  3  for comparison  the world s proven conventional oil reserves were estimated at 1.317 trillion barrels (209.4\xd710^9\xa0m3   as of 1 january 2007.[26  the largest deposits in the world occur in the united states in the green river formation  which covers portions of colorado  utah  and wyoming  about 70  of this resource lies on land owned or managed by the united states federal government  27  deposits in the united states constitute 62  of world resources  together  the united states  russia and brazil account for 86  of the world s resources in terms of shale-oil content  24  these figures remain tentative  with exploration or analysis of several deposits still outstanding  4  professor alan r  carroll of university of wisconsin u2013madison regards the upper permian lacustrine oil-shale deposits of northwest china  absent from previous global oil shale assessments  as comparable in size to the green river formation  28   humans have used oil shale as a fuel since prehistoric times  since it generally burns without any processing  30  britons of the iron age also used to polish it and form it into ornaments  31  the first patent for extracting oil from oil shale was british crown patent 330 granted in 1694 to three persons named martin eele  thomas hancock and william portlock who had  found a way to extract and make great quantities of pitch  tarr  and oyle out of a sort of stone   32][33][34   modern industrial mining of oil shale began in 1837 in autun  france  followed by exploitation in scotland  germany  and several other countries  35][36   operations during the 19th century focused on the production of kerosene  lamp oil  and paraffin  these products helped supply the growing demand for lighting that arose during the industrial revolution  37  fuel oil  lubricating oil and grease  and ammonium sulfate were also produced  38  the european oil-shale industry expanded immediately before world war i due to limited access to conventional petroleum resources and to the mass production of automobiles and trucks  which accompanied an increase in gasoline consumption   although the estonian and chinese oil-shale industries continued to grow after world war ii  most other countries abandoned their projects due to high processing costs and the availability of cheaper petroleum  4][36][39][40  following the 1973 oil crisis  world production of oil shale reached a peak of 46\xa0million tonnes in 1980 before falling to about 16\xa0million tonnes in 2000  due to competition from cheap conventional petroleum in the 1980s  7][24   on 2 may 1982  known in some circles as  black sunday   exxon canceled its us 5\xa0billion colony shale oil project near parachute  colorado because of low oil-prices and increased expenses  laying off more than 2,000\xa0workers and leaving a trail of home-foreclosures and small-business bankruptcies  41  in 1986  president ronald reagan signed into law the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985 which among other things abolished the united states  synthetic liquid fuels program  42   the global oil-shale industry began to revive at the beginning of the 21st century  in 2003  an oil-shale development program restarted in the united states  authorities introduced a commercial leasing program permitting the extraction of oil shale and oil sands on federal lands in 2005  in accordance with the energy policy act of 2005.[43][44   as of 2008 update   industry uses oil shale in brazil  china  estonia and to some extent in germany  and russia  several additional countries started assessing their reserves or had built experimental production plants  while others had phased out their oil shale industry  9  oil shale serves for oil production in estonia  brazil  and china  for power generation in estonia  china  and germany  for cement production in estonia  germany  and china  and for use in chemical industries in china  estonia  and russia  9][40][45][46   as of 2009 update   80  of oil shale used globally is extracted in estonia  mainly due to the oil-shale-fired power plants  45][47  oil-shale-fired power plants occur in estonia  which has an installed capacity of 2,967\xa0megawatts  mw   china (12\xa0mw   and germany (9.9\xa0mw   24][48  israel  romania and russia have in the past run power plants fired by oil shale  but have shut them down or switched to other fuel sources such as natural gas  9][24][49  jordan and egypt plan to construct power plants fired by oil shale  while canada and turkey plan to burn oil shale along with coal for power generation  24][50  oil shale serves as the main fuel for power generation only in estonia  where the oil-shale-fired narva power plants accounted for 95  of country s electrical generation in 2005.[51   according to the world energy council  in 2008 the total production of shale oil from oil shale was 930,000\xa0tonnes  equal to 17,700 barrels per day (2,810\xa0m3 d   of which china produced 375,000\xa0tonnes  estonia 355,000\xa0tonnes  and brazil 200,000\xa0tonnes  2  in comparison  production of the conventional oil and natural gas liquids in 2008 amounted 3.95\xa0billion tonnes or 82.1 million barrels per day (13.1\xd710^6\xa0m3/d   52   most exploitation of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere  after which one can burn the shale directly to generate electricity  or undertake further processing  the most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining  these procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale  and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface  underground mining of oil shale  which removes less of the overlying material  employs the room-and-pillar method  53   the extraction of the useful components of oil shale usually takes place above ground  ex-situ processing   although several newer technologies perform this underground  on-site or in-situ processing   54  in either case  the chemical process of pyrolysis converts the kerogen in the oil shale to shale oil  synthetic crude oil  and oil shale gas  most conversion technologies involve heating shale in the absence of oxygen to a temperature at which kerogen decomposes  pyrolyses  into gas  condensable oil  and a solid residue  this usually takes place between 450\xa0\xb0c (842\xa0\xb0f  and 500\xa0\xb0c (932\xa0\xb0f   1  the process of decomposition begins at relatively low temperatures (300\xa0\xb0c or 572\xa0\xb0f   but proceeds more rapidly and more completely at higher temperatures  55   in-situ processing involves heating the oil shale underground  such technologies can potentially extract more oil from a given area of land than ex-situ processes  since they can access the material at greater depths than surface mines can  several companies have patented methods for in-situ retorting  however  most of these methods remain in the experimental phase  one can distinguish true in-situ processes  tis  and modified in-situ processes  mis   true in-situ processes do not involve mining the oil shale  modified in-situ processes involve removing part of the oil shale and bringing it to the surface for modified in-situ retorting in order to create permeability for gas flow in a rubble chimney  explosives rubblize the oil-shale deposit  56   hundreds of patents for oil shale retorting technologies exist  57  however  only a few dozen have undergone testing  by 2006  only four technologies remained in commercial use  kiviter  galoter  fushun  and petrosix  58   industry can use oil shale as a fuel for thermal power-plants  burning it  like coal  to drive steam turbines  some of these plants employ the resulting heat for district heating of homes and businesses  in addition to its use as a fuel  oil shale may also serve in the production of specialty carbon fibers  adsorbent carbons  carbon black  phenols  resins  glues  tanning agents  mastic  road bitumen  cement  bricks  construction and decorative blocks  soil-additives  fertilizers  rock-wool insulation  glass  and pharmaceutical products  45  however  oil shale use for production of these items remains small or only in its experimental stages  4][59  some oil shales yield sulfur  ammonia  alumina  soda ash  uranium  and nahcolite as shale-oil extraction byproducts  between 1946 and 1952  a marine type of dictyonema shale served for uranium production in sillam xe4e  estonia  and between 1950 and 1989 sweden used alum shale for the same purposes  4  oil shale gas has served as a substitute for natural gas  but as of 2009 update   producing oil shale gas as a natural-gas substitute remained economically infeasible  60][61   the shale oil derived from oil shale does not directly substitute for crude oil in all applications  it may contain higher concentrations of olefins  oxygen  and nitrogen than conventional crude oil  42  some shale oils may have higher sulfur or arsenic content  by comparison with west texas intermediate  the benchmark standard for crude oil in the futures-contract market  the green river shale oil sulfur content ranges from near 0  to 4.9   in average 0.76    where west texas intermediate s sulfur content has a maximum of 0.42%.[62  the sulfur content in shale oil from jordan s oil shales may rise even up to 9.5%.[63  the arsenic content  for example  becomes an issue for green river formation oil shale  the higher concentrations of these materials means that the oil must undergo considerable upgrading  hydrotreating  before serving as oil-refinery feedstock  64  above-ground retorting processes tended to yield a lower api gravity shale oil than the in situ processes  shale oil serves best for producing middle-distillates such as kerosene  jet fuel  and diesel fuel  worldwide demand for these middle distillates  particularly for diesel fuels  increased rapidly in the 1990s and 2000s  42][65  however  appropriate refining processes equivalent to hydrocracking can transform shale oil into a lighter-range hydrocarbon (gasoline   42   the amount of economically recoverable oil shale is unknown  3  the various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the cost of shale-oil production in a given region comes in below the price of crude oil or its other substitutes  according to a survey conducted by the rand corporation  the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the united states  comprising a mine  retorting plant  upgrading plant  supporting utilities  and spent shale reclamation   would range between us 70\u201395 ($440\u2013600/m3  adjusted to 2005 values   this estimate considers varying levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency  in order to run a profitable operation  the price of crude oil would need to remain above these levels  the analysis also discusses the expectation that processing costs would drop after the establishment of the complex  the hypothetical unit would see a cost reduction of 35\u201370  after producing its first 500 million barrels (79\xd710^6\xa0m3   assuming an increase in output of 25 thousand barrels per day (4.0\xd710^3\xa0m3 d  during each year after the start of commercial production  rand predicts the costs would decline to $35\u201348 per barrel ($220\u2013300/m3  within 12 years  after achieving the milestone of 1 billion barrels (160\xd710^6\xa0m3   its costs would decline further to $30\u201340 per barrel ($190\u2013250/m3).[45][53  some commentators compare the proposed american oil-shale industry to the athabasca oil-sands industry  the latter enterprise generated over 1 million barrels (160,000\xa0m3  of oil per day in late 2007   stating that  the first-generation facility is the hardest  both technically and economically   66][67   in 2005  royal dutch shell announced that its in-situ process could become competitive for oil prices over $30\xa0per barrel ($190/m3).[68  a 2004 report by the united states department of energy stated that both the shell technology and technology used in the stuart oil shale project could be competitive at prices above $25 per barrel  and that the viru keemia grupp expected full-scale production to be economical at prices above $18\xa0per barrel ($130/m3).[56][69   to increase efficiency when retorting oil shale  researchers have proposed and tested several co-pyrolysis processes  70][71][72][73][74   a 1972 publication in the journal p xe9trole informations (issn xa00755-561x  compared shale-based oil production unfavorably with coal liquefaction  the article portrayed coal liquefaction as less expensive  generating more oil  and creating fewer environmental impacts than extraction from oil shale  it cited a conversion ratio of 650 liters (170\xa0u s  xa0gal  140\xa0imp xa0gal  of oil per one ton of coal  as against 150 liters (40\xa0u s  xa0gal  33\xa0imp xa0gal  of shale oil per one ton of oil shale  36   a critical measure of the viability of oil shale as an energy source lies in the ratio of the energy produced by the shale to the energy used in its mining and processing  a ratio known as  energy returned on energy invested   eroei   a 1984 study estimated the eroei of the various known oil-shale deposits as varying between 0.7\u201313.3[75  although known oil-shale extraction development projects assert an eroei between 3 and 10  according to the world energy outlook 2010  the eroei of ex-situ processing is typically 4 to 5 while of in-situ processing it may be even as low as 2  however  according to the iea most of used energy can be provided by burning the spent shale or oil-shale gas  76   the water needed in the oil shale retorting process offers an additional economic consideration  this may pose a problem in areas with water scarcity   mining oil shale involves a number of environmental impacts  more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining  77  these include acid drainage induced by the sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials  the introduction of metals including mercury 78  into surface-water and groundwater  increased erosion  sulfur-gas emissions  and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing  transport  and support activities  7][8  in 2002  about 97  of air pollution  86  of total waste and 23  of water pollution in estonia came from the power industry  which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production  79   oil-shale extraction can damage the biological and recreational value of land and the ecosystem in the mining area  combustion and thermal processing generate waste material  in addition  the atmospheric emissions from oil shale processing and combustion include carbon dioxide  a greenhouse gas  environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale  as it creates even more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels  80  section 526 of the energy independence and security act prohibits united states government agencies from buying oil produced by processes that produce more greenhouse gas emissions than would traditional petroleum  81  experimental in situ conversion processes and carbon capture and storage technologies may reduce some of these concerns in the future  but at the same time they may cause other problems  including groundwater pollution  82  among the water contaminants commonly associated with oil shale processing are oxygen and nitrogen heterocyclic hydrocarbons  commonly detected examples include quinoline derivatives  pyridine  and various alkyl homologues of pyridine  picoline  lutidine   83   some have expressed concerns over the oil shale industry s use of water  in 2002  the oil shale-fired power industry used 91  of the water consumed in estonia  79  depending on technology  above-ground retorting uses between one and five barrels of water per barrel of produced shale-oil  53][84][85][86  a 2008 programmatic environmental impact statement issued by the us bureau of land management stated that surface mining and retort operations produce 2 to 10 u s  gallons (7.6 to 37.9\xa0l  1.7 to 8.3\xa0imp xa0gal  of waste water per 1 short ton (0.91\xa0t  of processed oil shale  84  in situ processing  according to one estimate  uses about one-tenth as much water  87   water concerns become particularly sensitive issues in arid regions  such as the western us and israel s negev desert  where plans exist to expand oil-shale extraction despite a water shortage  88   environmental activists  including members of greenpeace  have organized strong protests against the oil shale industry  in one result  queensland energy resources put the proposed stuart oil shale project in australia on hold in 2004.[7][89][90   some comets contain  massive amounts of an organic material almost identical to high grade oil shale   the equivalent of cubic kilometers of such mixed with other material  91  for instance  corresponding hydrocarbons were detected in a probe fly-by through the tail of comet halley during 1986.[92
