Droopspeedcontrol
 in electrical power generation  droop speed control is a speed control mode of a prime mover driving a synchronous generator connected to an electrical grid  this mode allows synchronous generators to run in parallel  so that loads are shared among generators in proportion to their power rating   the frequency of a synchronous generator is given by  where  the frequency  f  of a synchronous generator is directly proportional to its speed  n   when multiple synchronous generators are connected in parallel to electrical grid  the frequency is fixed by the grid  since individual power output of each generator will be small compared to the load on a large grid  synchronous generators connected to the grid run at various speeds but they all run at the same frequency because they differ in the number of poles  p    a speed reference as percentage of actual speed is set in this mode  as the generator is loaded from no load to base load  the actual speed of the prime mover tend to decrease  in order to increase the power output in this mode  the prime mover speed reference is increased  because the actual prime mover speed is fixed by the grid  this difference in speed reference and actual speed of the prime mover is used to increase the flow of working fluid  fuel  steam  etc   to the prime mover  and hence power output is increased  the reverse will be true for decreasing power output  the prime mover speed reference is always greater than actual speed of the prime mover  the actual speed of the prime mover is allowed to  droop  or decrease with respect to the reference  and so the name   for example  if the turbine is rated at 3000 rpm  and the machine speed reduces from 3000 rpm to 2880 rpm when it is loaded from no load to base load  then the droop xa0  is given by  in this case  speed reference will be 104  and actual speed will be 100   for every 1  change in the turbine speed reference  the power output of the turbine will change by 25  of rated for a unit with a 4  droop setting   droop is therefore expressed as the percentage change in  design  speed required for 100  governor action   for example  how fuel flow is increased or decreased in a ge-design heavy duty gas turbine can be given by the formula   where   as frequency is fixed on the grid  and so actual turbine speed is also fixed  the increase in turbine speed reference will increase the error between reference and actual speed  as the difference increases  fuel flow is increased to increase power output  and vice versa  this type of control is referred to as  straight proportional  control  if the entire grid tends to be overloaded  the grid frequency and hence actual speed of generator will decrease  all units will see an increase in the speed error  and so increase fuel flow to their prime movers and power output  in this way droop speed control mode also helps to hold a stable grid frequency  the amount of power produced is strictly proportional to the error between the actual turbine speed and speed reference  the above formula is nothing but the equation of a straight line  y   mx   q    it can be mathematically shown that if all machines synchronized to a system have the same droop speed control  they will share load proportionate to the machine ratings  1   for stable operation of the electrical grid of north america  power plants typically operate with a four or five percent speed droop  2  citation needed  with 5  droop the full-load speed is 100  and the no-load speed is 105   this is required for the stable operation of the net without hunting and dropouts of power plants  normally the changes in speed are minor due to inertia of the total rotating mass of all generators and motors running in the net  3  adjustments in power output are made by slowly raising the droop curve by increasing the spring pressure on a centrifugal governor or by an engine control unit adjustment  generally this is a basic system requirement for all power plants because the older and newer plants have to be compatible in response to the instantaneous changes in frequency without depending on outside communication  voltage control of several power sources is not practical because there would not be any independent feedback  resulting in the total load being put on one power plant  4   the thousands of ac generators are running synchronously with the power grid which acts like an infinite sink  next to the inertia given by the parallel operation of synchronous generators  5  the frequency speed droop is the primary instantaneous parameter in control of an individual power plant s power output (kw   6   s is the ratio of frequency deviation when comparing the load versus the nominal frequency
