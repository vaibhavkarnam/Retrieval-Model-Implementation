 three-phase electric power is a common method of alternating-current electric power generation  transmission  and distribution  1  it is a type of polyphase system and is the most common method used by electrical grids worldwide to transfer power  it is also used to power large motors and other heavy loads   a three-phase system is usually more economical than an equivalent single-phase at the same line to ground voltage because it uses less conductor material to transmit a given amount of electrical power  2  the three-phase system was independently invented by galileo ferraris  mikhail dolivo-dobrovolsky  jonas wenstr xf6m and nikola tesla in the late 1880s       in a symmetric three-phase power supply system  three conductors each carry an alternating current of the same frequency and voltage amplitude relative to a common reference but with a phase difference of one third the period  the common reference is usually connected to ground and often to a current-carrying conductor called the neutral  due to the phase difference  the voltage on any conductor reaches its peak at one third of a cycle after one of the other conductors and one third of a cycle before the remaining conductor  this phase delay gives constant power transfer to a balanced linear load  it also makes it possible to produce a rotating magnetic field in an electric motor and generate other phase arrangements using transformers  for instance  a two phase system using a scott-t transformer    the symmetric three-phase systems described here are simply referred to as three-phase systems because  although it is possible to design and implement asymmetric three-phase power systems  i e   with unequal voltages or phase shifts   they are not used in practice because they lack the most important advantages of symmetric systems   in a three-phase system feeding a balanced and linear load  the sum of the instantaneous currents of the three conductors is zero  in other words  the current in each conductor is equal in magnitude to the sum of the currents in the other two  but with the opposite sign  the return path for the current in any phase conductor is the other two phase conductors   as compared to a single-phase ac power supply that uses two conductors  phase and neutral   a three-phase supply with no neutral and the same phase-to-ground voltage and current capacity per phase can transmit three times as much power using just 1.5 times as many wires  i e   three instead of two   thus  the ratio of capacity to conductor material is doubled  the same ratio of capacity to conductor material can also be attained with a center-grounded single-phase system  3   constant power transfer and cancelling phase currents would in theory be possible with any number  greater than one  of phases  maintaining the capacity conductor material ratio that is twice that of single-phase power  however  two-phase power results in a less smooth  pulsating  torque in a generator or motor  making smooth power transfer a challenge   and more than three phases complicates infrastructure unnecessarily  4   three-phase systems may also have a fourth wire  particularly in low-voltage distribution  this is the neutral wire  the neutral allows three separate single-phase supplies to be provided at a constant voltage and is commonly used for supplying groups of domestic properties which are each single-phase loads  the connections are arranged so that  as far as possible in each group  equal power is drawn from each phase  further up the distribution system  the currents are usually well balanced  transformers may be wired in a way that they have a four-wire secondary but a three-wire primary while allowing unbalanced loads and the associated secondary-side neutral currents   three-phase supplies have properties that make them very desirable in electric power distribution systems   most household loads are single-phase  in north american residences  three-phase power might feed a multiple-unit apartment block  but the household loads are connected only as single phase  in lower-density areas  only a single phase might be used for distribution  some high-power domestic appliances such as electric stoves and clothes dryers are powered by two or three phases instead of one in order to use lower currents  so households with such appliances must be provided with more than one phase   wiring for the three phases is typically identified by color codes which vary by country  connection of the phases in the right order is required to ensure the intended direction of rotation of three-phase motors  for example  pumps and fans may not work in reverse  maintaining the identity of phases is required if there is any possibility two sources can be connected at the same time  a direct interconnection between two different phases is a short-circuit   at the power station  an electrical generator converts mechanical power into a set of three ac electric currents  one from each coil  or winding  of the generator  the windings are arranged such that the currents vary sinusoidally at the same frequency but with the peaks and troughs of their wave forms offset to provide three complementary currents with a phase separation of one-third cycle (120\xb0 or \u200a2\u03c0\u20443 radians   the generator frequency is typically 50 or 60 hz  depending on the country   at the power station  transformers change the voltage from generators to a level suitable for transmission in order to minimize losses   after further voltage conversions in the transmission network  the voltage is finally transformed to the standard utilization before power is supplied to customers   most automotive alternators generate three-phase ac and rectify it to dc with a diode bridge  7   a  delta  connected transformer winding is connected between phases of a three-phase system  a  wye  transformer connects each winding from a phase wire to a common neutral point   a single three-phase transformer can be used  or three single-phase transformers   in an  open delta  or  v  system  only two transformers are used  a closed delta made of three single-phase transformers can operate as an open delta if one of the transformers has failed or needs to be removed  8  in open delta  each transformer must carry current for its respective phases as well as current for the third phase  therefore capacity is reduced to 87   with one of three transformers missing and the remaining two at 87  efficiency  the capacity is 58  (\u200a2\u20443 of 87%).[9][10   where a delta-fed system must be grounded for detection of stray current to ground or protection from surge voltages  a grounding transformer  usually a zigzag transformer  may be connected to allow ground fault currents to return from any phase to ground  another variation is a  corner grounded  delta system  which is a closed delta that is grounded at one of the junctions of transformers  11   there are two basic three-phase configurations  wye  y  and delta (\u0394   as shown in the diagram  a delta configuration requires only 3 wires for transmission but a wye  star  configuration may have a fourth wire  the fourth wire  if present  is provided as a neutral and is normally grounded  the "3-wire  and "4-wire  designations do not count the ground wire used above many transmission lines  which is solely for fault protection and does not carry current under non-fault conditions   a four-wire system with symmetrical voltages between phase and neutral is obtained when the neutral is connected to the  common star point  of all supply windings  in such a system  all three phases will have the same magnitude of voltage relative to the neutral  other non-symmetrical systems have been used   the four-wire wye system is used when ground referenced voltages or the flexibility of more voltage selections are required  faults on one phase to ground will cause a protection event  fuse or breaker open  locally and not involve other phases or other connected equipment  citation needed  an example of application is local distribution in europe  and elsewhere   where each customer may be only fed from one phase and the neutral  which is common to the three phases   when a group of customers sharing the neutral draw unequal phase currents  the common neutral wire carries the currents resulting from these imbalances  electrical engineers try to design the system so the loads are balanced as much as possible within premises where 3-phase power is used  12  these same principles apply to the wide scale distribution of power to individual premises  hence  every effort is made by supply authorities to distribute all three phases over a large number of premises so that  on average  as nearly as possible a balanced load is seen at the point of supply   for domestic use  some countries such as the uk may supply one phase and neutral at a high current  up to 100a  to one property  while others such as germany may supply 3 phases and neutral to each customer  but at a lower fuse rating  typically 32 a per phase  and  shuffled  to avoid the effect that more load tends to be put on the first phase  citation needed   in north america  a high-leg delta supply is sometimes used where one winding of a delta-connected transformer feeding the load is center-tapped and that center tap is grounded and connected as a neutral as shown in the second diagram  this setup produces three different voltages  if the voltage between the center tap  neutral  and each of the two adjacent phases is 120 v (100    the voltage across any two phases is 240 v (200    and the neutral to  high leg  voltage is \u2248 208 v (173%).[8   the reason for providing the delta connected supply is usually to power large motors requiring a rotating field  however  the premises concerned will also require the  normal  north american 120 v supplies  two of which are derived (180 degrees  out of phase   between the  neutral  and either of the center tapped phase points   in the perfectly balanced case all three lines share equivalent loads  examining the circuits we can derive relationships between line voltage and current  and load voltage and current for wye and delta connected loads   in a balanced system each line will produce equal voltage magnitudes at phase angles equally spaced from each other  with v1 as our reference and v3 lagging v2 lagging v1  using angle notation  we have  13   these voltages feed into either a wye or delta connected load   the voltage seen by the load will depend on the load connection  for the wye case  connecting each load to a phase  line-to-neutral  voltages gives  13   where ztotal is the sum of line and load impedances  ztotal   zln   zy   and \u03b8 is the phase of the total impedance  ztotal    the phase angle difference between voltage and current of each phase is not necessarily 0 and is dependent on the type of load impedance  zy  inductive and capacitive loads will cause current to either lag or lead the voltage  however  the relative phase angle between each pair of lines (1 to 2  2 to 3  and 3 to 1  will still be \u2212120\xb0   by applying kirchhoff s current law  kcl  to the neutral node  the three phase currents sum to the total current in the neutral line  in the balanced case   vab

yields a line-to-line voltage that is greater by a factor of 31/2  as a delta configuration connects a load across phases of a transformer  it delivers the line-to-line voltage difference  which is 31/2 times greater than the line-to-neutral voltage delivered to a load in the wye configuration  as the power transferred is v2 z  the impedance in the delta configuration must be 3 times what it would be in a wye configuration for the same power to be transferred   single-phase loads may be connected across any two phases  or a load can be connected from phase to neutral  14  distributing single-phase loads among the phases of a three-phase system balances the load and makes most economical use of conductors and transformers   in a symmetrical three-phase four-wire  wye system  the three phase conductors have the same voltage to the system neutral  the voltage between line conductors is \u221a3 times the phase conductor to neutral voltage  15   the currents returning from the customers  premises to the supply transformer all share the neutral wire  if the loads are evenly distributed on all three phases  the sum of the returning currents in the neutral wire is approximately zero  any unbalanced phase loading on the secondary side of the transformer will use the transformer capacity inefficiently   if the supply neutral is broken  phase-to-neutral voltage is no longer maintained  phases with higher relative loading will experience reduced voltage  and phases with lower relative loading will experience elevated voltage  up to the phase-to-phase voltage   a high-leg delta provides phase-to-neutral relationship of vll   2\u2009vln u2009  however  ln load is imposed on one phase  8  a transformer manufacturer s page suggests that ln loading not exceed 5

live wires of a three-phase system are not equal or are not at an exact 120\xb0 phase angle  the power loss is greater than for a perfectly balanced system  the method of symmetrical components is used to analyze unbalanced systems   with linear loads  the neutral only carries the current due to imbalance between the phases  devices that utilize rectifier-capacitor front-end such as switch-mode power supplies  computers  office equipment and such produce third-order harmonics that are in-phase on all the supply phases  consequently  such harmonic currents add in the neutral in a wye system  or in the grounded  zigzag  transformer in a delta system   which can cause the neutral current to exceed the phase current  14][17   an important class of three-phase load is the electric motor  a three-phase induction motor has a simple design  inherently high starting torque and high efficiency  such motors are applied in industry for many applications  a three-phase motor is more compact and less costly than a single-phase motor of the same voltage class and rating and single-phase ac motors above 10 hp (7.5\xa0kw  are uncommon  three-phase motors also vibrate less and hence last longer than single-phase motors of the same power used under the same conditions   resistance heating loads such as electric boilers or space heating may be connected to three-phase systems  electric lighting may also be similarly connected   line frequency flicker in light is detrimental to high speed cameras used in sports event broadcasting for slow motion replays  it can be reduced by evenly spreading line frequency operated light sources across the three phases across so that the illuminated area is lit from all three phases  this technique was applied successfully at the 2008 beijing olympics  18   rectifiers may use a three-phase source to produce a six-pulse dc output  19  the output of such rectifiers is much smoother than rectified single phase and  unlike single-phase  does not drop to zero between pulses  such rectifiers may be used for battery charging  electrolysis processes such as aluminium production or for operation of dc motors   zig-zag  transformers may make the equivalent of six-phase full-wave rectification  twelve pulses per cycle  and this method is occasionally employed to reduce the cost of the filtering components  while improving the quality of the resulting dc   one example of a three-phase load is the electric arc furnace used in steelmaking and in refining of ores   in many european countries electric stoves are usually designed for a three-phase feed  individual heating units are often connected between phase and neutral to allow for connection to a single-phase circuit if three-phase is not available  20  other usual three-phase loads in the domestic field are tankless water heating systems and storage heaters  homes in europe and the uk have standardized on a nominal 230\xa0v between any phase and ground   existing supplies remain near 240\xa0v in the uk  and 220\xa0v on much of the continent   most groups of houses are fed from a three-phase street transformer so that individual premises with above-average demand can be fed with a second or third phase connection   phase converters are used when three-phase equipment needs to be operated on a single-phase power source  they are used when three-phase power is not available or cost is not justifiable  such converters may also allow the frequency to be varied  allowing speed control  some railway locomotives use a single-phase source to drive three-phase motors fed through an electronic drive  21   a rotary phase converter is a three-phase motor with special starting arrangements and power factor correction that produces balanced three-phase voltages  when properly designed  these rotary converters can allow satisfactory operation of a three-phase motor on a single-phase source  in such a device  the energy storage is performed by the inertia  flywheel effect  of the rotating components  an external flywheel is sometimes found on one or both ends of the shaft   a three-phase generator can be driven by a single-phase motor  this motor-generator combination can provide a frequency changer function as well as phase conversion  but requires two machines with all their expenses and losses  the motor-generator method can also form an uninterruptible power supply when used in conjunction with a large flywheel and a battery-powered dc motor for really constant power  a standby generator set gives more frequency drop until standby generator kicks in   capacitors and autotransformers can be used to approximate a three-phase system in a static phase converter  but the voltage and phase angle of the additional phase may only be useful for certain loads   variable-frequency drives and digital phase converters use power electronic devices to synthesize a balanced three-phase supply from single-phase input power   conductors of a three-phase system are usually identified by a color code  to allow for balanced loading and to assure the correct phase rotation for motors  colors used may adhere to international standard iec 60446  now merged into iec 60445   older standards or to no standard at all and may vary even within a single installation  for example  in the u s  and canada  different color codes are used for grounded  earthed  and ungrounded systems
