SustainableDevelopmentGoals
 the sustainable development goals  sdgs   officially known as transforming our world  the 2030 agenda for sustainable development is a set of seventeen aspirational  global goals  with 169 targets between them  spearheaded by the united nations  through a deliberative process involving its 194 member states  as well as global civil society  the goals are contained in paragraph 54 united nations resolution a res 70/1 of 25 september 2015.[1  the resolution is broader intergovernmental agreement that  while acting as the post 2015 development agenda  successor to the millennium development goals   builds on the principles agreed upon under resolution a res 66/288  popularly known as the future we want  2  the sdgs were in large measure informed by the oft quoted assertion by united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon that  there can be no plan b  because there is no planet b    on 19 july 2014  the un general assembly s open working group  owg  on sustainable development goals  sdgs  forwarded a proposal for the sdgs to the assembly  the proposal contained 17 goals with 169 targets covering a broad range of sustainable development issues  these included ending poverty and hunger  improving health and education  making cities more sustainable  combating climate change  and protecting oceans and forests  3  on 5 december 2014  the un general assembly accepted the secretary-general s synthesis report which stated that the agenda for the post-2015 sdg process would be based on the owg proposals  4   the intergovernmental negotiations on the post 2015 development agenda  ign  began in january 2015 and ended in august 2015  following the negotiations  a final document was adopted at the un sustainable development summit september 25\u201327  2015 in new york  usa  5  the title of the agenda is transforming our world  the 2030 agenda for sustainable development  6][7       the history of the sdgs can be traced to 1972 when governments met under in stockholm  sweden  for the united nations conference on the human environment  to consider the rights of the human family to a healthy and productive environment  8  it was not until 1983 that the united nations decided to create the world commission on environment and development which defined sustainable development as  meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs   in 1992 the first united nations conference on environment and development was held in rio  it was here that the first agenda for environment and development was developed and adopted  also known as agenda 21   in preparation for the rio 20 conference indonesia held a government retreat in solo indonesia in july 2011  it was at this event that colombia proposed the idea of the sdgs  this was picked up by the united nations department of public information 64th ngo conference in september 2011 in bonn where the outcome document proposed 17 sustainable development goals and associated targets  in the runup to rio 20 there was much discussion on the idea of sdgs  at the rio 20 conference  a resolution  known as the future we want 9  was reached by member states  among the key themes agreed on were poverty eradication  energy  water and sanitation  health  and human settlement  paragraph 246 of the future we want outcome document forms the link between the rio 20 agreement and the millennium development goals   we recognize that the development of goals could also be useful for pursuing focused and coherent action on sustainable development  the goals should address and incorporate in a balanced way all three dimensions of sustainable development  environment  economics  and society  and their interlinkages  the development of these goals should not divert focus or effort from the achievement of the millennium development goals   paragraph 249 states that  the process needs to be coordinated and coherent with the processes to consider the post-2015 development agenda    taken together  these two paragraphs paved the way to bring together the development agenda centered on the millennium development goals (mdgs   10  which were officially established following the millennium summit of the united nations in 2000  and the agreement under the future we want outcome document  the rio 20 summit also agreed that the process of designing sustainable development goals  should be  action-oriented  concise and easy to communicate  limited in number  aspirational  global in nature and universally applicable to all countries while taking into account different national realities  capacities and levels of development and respecting national policies and priorities   11   the mdgs were supposed to be achieved by 2015  a further process was needed to agree and develop development goals from 2015-2030  discussion on the post-2015 framework for international development began well in advance  with the united nations system task team on post 2015 development agenda 12  releasing the first report known as realizing the future we want  13  the report was the first attempt to achieve the requirements under paragraph 246 and 249 of the future we want document  it identified four dimensions as part of a global vision for sustainable development  inclusive social development  environmental sustainability  inclusive economic development  and peace and security  other processes included the un secretary general s high level panel on post 2015 development agenda  14  whose report 15  was submitted to the secretary general in 2013   on 25 september 2015  the 194 countries of the un general assembly adopted the 2030 development agenda titled transforming our world  the 2030 agenda for sustainable development  following the adoption  un agencies  under the umbrella of the united nations development group  decided to support a campaign by several independent entities  among them corporate institutions and international organizations  the campaign  known as project everyone  16  introduced the term global goals and is intended to help communicate the agreed sustainable development goals to a wider constituency  however the decision to support what is an independent campaign  without the approval of the member states  has met resistance 17  from several sections of civil society and governments  who accuse 18  the undg of ignoring the most important communication aspect of the agreement  sustainability  there are also concerns that global goals is a term used to refer to several other processes that are not related to the united nations   the official agenda for sustainable development adopted on 25 september 2015 has 92 paragraphs  with the main paragraph (51  outlining the 17 sustainable development goals and its associated 169 targets  this included the following goals  19   as of august 2015  there were 169 proposed targets for these goals and 304 proposed indicators to show compliance  37   since rio 20 did not elaborate specific goals  a 30-member open working group  owg  was established on 22 january 2013 by the decision of the un general assembly  the owg was tasked with preparing a proposal on the sdgs for consideration during the 68th session of the general assembly  september 2013 \u2013 september 2014.[38   the open working group used a constituency-based system of representation  which meant that most of the seats in the working group are shared by several countries  after 13 sessions  the owg submitted their proposal of 17 sdgs and 169 targets to the 68th session of the un general assembly in september  2014.[39   the rio 20 outcome document stated that  \u201cat the outset  the owg will decide on its methods of work  including developing modalities to ensure the full involvement of relevant stakeholders and expertise from civil society  the scientific community and the united nations system in its work  in order to provide a diversity of perspectives and experience u201d  40   a report by the international food policy research institute  ifpri  of 2013 criticized the efforts of the sdgs as not ambitious enough  instead of aiming for an end to poverty by 2030  the report  an ambitious development goal  ending hunger and undernutrition by 2025  calls for a greater emphasis on eliminating hunger and undernutrition and achieving that in 5 years less  by 2025  it bases its claims on an analysis of the experiences from china  vietnam  brazil and thailand and identifies 3 pathways to achieving this goal  agriculture-led  social protection- and nutrition intervention-led  or a combination of both of these approaches  41   the sdgs have been criticized for being contradictory  because in seeking high levels of global gdp growth  they will undermine their own ecological objectives  it has also been noted that  in relation to the headline goal of eliminating extreme poverty   a growing number of scholars are pointing out that $1.25 is actually not adequate for human subsistence   and the poverty line should be revised to as high as $5.[42   a commentary in the economist argued that the 169 targets for the sdgs are too many  calling them  sprawling    misconceived   and  a mess  compared to the millennium development goals  it also criticised the goals for ignoring local context and promoting  cookie-cutter development policies   they claimed that all other sustainable development goals are founded on achieving sdg number one  the economist estimated that trying to alleviate poverty and achieving the other sustainable development goals will require about us 2 trillion to 3 trillion per annum for the next 15 years  which critics do not see as being feasible  the reduction in the number of people living in abject poverty has been criticized as a result of the growth of china  the mdgs have been mistakenly credited for this drop  43  the sdgs have also been criticized due to the inherent shortcomings in the very concept of sustainable development and the inability of the latter to either stabilize rising carbon dioxide concentration or ensure environmental harmony  44   another view held by nearly all the stakeholders engaged in the negotiations of the sustainable development goals was that the reason there were 17 goals was because the agenda they were addressing was so all encompassing  when adopted this was the first outcome from a un conference that was not criticized by any major nongovernmental organizations which showed the wide and strong support that the sdgs had  this is in stark contrast to the mdgs which were heavily criticized by ngos  the difference between the mdgs and the sdgs were that the mdgs dealt with the problems  the sdg the causes of the problem  the mdgs were about development while the sdgs were about sustainable development  the mdgs were addressing silos and the sdgs the interlinkages   wash experts have stated that without progress on goal 6  the other goals and targets will not be able to be achieved  45][46   nations and other parties negotiating at the un have highlighted the links between the post-2015 sdg process  the financing for development process to be concluded in addis ababa in july 2015  and the cop 21 climate change conference in paris in december 2015.[47   in may 2015  a report concluded that only a very ambitious climate deal in paris in 2015 will enable countries to reach the sustainable development goals and targets  48  the report also states that tackling climate change will only be possible if the sdgs are met  and that development and climate are inextricably linked  particularly around poverty  gender equality  and energy  the un encourages the public sector to take initiative in this effort for minimizing negative impacts on the environment  49   despite stand-alone goals on health  gender equality and education  among others  there is widespread consensus that progress against any and all of the sdgs will be stalled if women s empowerment and gender equality is not prioritized  arguments and evidence from sources as diverse and as economically oriented as the oecd  to expected sources such as un women  bolster the case that investments in women and girls impact national and global development in ways that exceed their initial scope of interest  50   world pensions council  wpc  development economists have argued that the twin considerations of long-term economic growth and infrastructure investment weren u2019t addressed
