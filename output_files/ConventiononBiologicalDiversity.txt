ConventiononBiologicalDiversity
 the convention on biological diversity  cbd   known informally as the biodiversity convention  is a multilateral treaty  the convention has three main goals including  the conservation of biological diversity  or biodiversity   the sustainable use of its components  and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from genetic resources   in other words  its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity  it is often seen as the key document regarding sustainable development  the convention was opened for signature at the earth summit in rio de janeiro on 5 june 1992 and entered into force on 29 december 1993  at the 2010 10th conference of parties  cop  to the convention on biological diversity in october in nagoya  japan  the nagoya protocol was adopted  1       the notion of an international convention on biological diversity was conceived at a united nations environment programme  unep  ad hoc working group of experts on biological diversity in november 1988  the subsequent year  the ad hoc working group of technical and legal experts was established for the drafting of a legal text which addressed the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity  as well as the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization with sovereign states and local communities  in 1991  an intergovernmental negotiating committee was established  tasked with finalizing the convention s text  2   a conference for the adoption of the agreed text of the convention on biological diversity was held in nairobi  kenya  in 1992  and its conclusions were distilled in the nairobi final act  3  the convention s text was opened for signature on 5 june 1992 at the united nations conference on environment and development  the rio  earth summit    by its closing date  4 june 1993  the convention had received 168 signatures  it entered into force on 29 december 1993.[2   the convention recognized for the first time in international law that the conservation of biological conservation of biodiversity is  a common concern of humankind  and is an integral part of the development process  the agreement covers all ecosystems  species  and genetic resources  it links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably  it sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources  notably those destined for commercial use  it also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its cartagena protocol on biosafety  addressing technology development and transfer  benefit-sharing and biosafety issues  importantly  the convention is legally binding  countries that join it   parties   are obliged to implement its provisions   the convention reminds decision-makers that natural resources are not infinite and sets out a philosophy of sustainable use  while past conservation efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats  the convention recognizes that ecosystems  species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans  however  this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity   the convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the precautionary principle which demands that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity  lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat  the convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve biological diversity  it argues  however  that conservation will bring us significant environmental  economic and social benefits in return   the convention on biological diversity of 2010 banned some forms of geoengineering   some of the many issues dealt with under the convention include   the cartagena protocol on biosafety of the convention  also known as the biosafety protocol  was adopted in january 2000  the biosafety protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology   the biosafety protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the precautionary principle and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits  it will for example let countries ban imports of a genetically modified organism if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is safe and requires exporters to label shipments containing genetically modified commodities such as corn or cotton   the required number of 50 instruments of ratification accession approval acceptance by countries was reached in may 2003  in accordance with the provisions of its article 37  the protocol entered into force on 11 september 2003   in april 2002  the parties of the un cbd adopted the recommendations of the gran canaria declaration calling for a global plant conservation strategy  and adopted a 16-point plan aiming to slow the rate of plant extinctions around the world by 2010   as of 2016  the convention has 196 parties  which includes 195 states and the european union  4  all un member states u2014with the exception of the united states u2014have ratified the treaty  non-un member states that have ratified are the cook islands  niue  and the state of palestine  the holy see and the states with limited recognition are non-parties  the us has signed but not ratified the treaty  5  and has not announced plans to ratify it   conference of the parties  the convention s governing body is the conference of the parties  cop   consisting of all governments  and regional economic integration organizations  that have ratified the treaty  this ultimate authority reviews progress under the convention  identifies new priorities  and sets work plans for members  the cop can also make amendments to the convention  create expert advisory bodies  review progress reports by member nations  and collaborate with other international organizations and agreements   the conference of the parties uses expertise and support from several other bodies that are established by the convention  in addition to committees or mechanisms established on an ad hoc basis  two main organs are   secretariat  the cbd secretariat  based in montreal  operates under the united nations environment programme  its main functions are to organize meetings  draft documents  assist member governments in the implementation of the programme of work  coordinate with other international organizations  and collect and disseminate information   subsidiary body for scientific  technical and technological advice  sbstta   the subsidiary body on scientific  technical and technological advice  sbstta   the sbstta is a committee composed of experts from member governments competent in relevant fields  it plays a key role in making recommendations to the cop on scientific and technical issues  13th meeting of the subsidiary body on scientific  technical and technological advice (sbstta-13  held from 18 to 22 february 2008 in the food and agriculture organization at rome  italy  sbstta-13 delegates met in the committee of the whole in the morning to finalize and adopt recommendations on the in-depth reviews of the work programmes on agricultural and forest biodiversity and sbstta s modus operandi for the consideration of new and emerging issues  the closing plenary convened in the afternoon to adopt recommendations on inland waters biodiversity  marine biodiversity  invasive alien species and biodiversity and climate change  the current chairperson of the sbstta is dr  senka barudanovic    national biodiversity strategies and action plans  nbsaps  are the principal instruments for implementing the convention at the national level  article 6   the convention requires countries to prepare a national biodiversity strategy  or equivalent instrument  and to ensure that this strategy is mainstreamed into the planning and activities of all those sectors whose activities can have an impact  positive and negative  on biodiversity  to date [2012-02-01   173 parties have developed nbsaps in line with article 6."[6   for example  the united kingdom  new zealand and tanzania have carried out elaborate responses to conserve individual species and specific habitats  the united states of america  a signatory who has not yet ratified the treaty  7  has produced one of the most thorough implementation programs through species recovery programs and other mechanisms long in place in the usa for species conservation   singapore has also established a detailed national biodiversity strategy and action plan  8  the national biodiversity centre of singapore represents singapore in the convention for biological diversity  9   in accordance with article 26 of the convention  parties prepare national reports on the status of implementation of the convention   the current executive secretary is braulio ferreira de souza dias  who took up this post on 15 february 2012.[10  dr ahmed djoghlaf was the previous executive secretary   the nagoya protocol on access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilization to the convention on biological diversity 11  is a supplementary agreement to the convention on biological diversity  it provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the cbd  the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources  the protocol was adopted on 29 october 2010 in nagoya  aichi province  japan  and entered into force on 12 october 2014  its objective is the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources  thereby contributing to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity  12   the first ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in november and december 1994  in nassau  bahamas  13   the second ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in november 1995  in jakarta  indonesia  14   the third ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in november 1996  in buenos aires  argentina  15   the fourth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in may 1998  in bratislava  slovakia  16   the first extraordinary meeting of the conference of the parties took place in february 1999  in cartagena  colombia  17   the fifth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in may 2000  in nairobi  kenya  18   the sixth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in april 2002  in the hague  netherlands  19   the seventh ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in february 2004  in kuala lumpur  malaysia  20   the eighth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in march 2006  in curitiba  brazil  21   the ninth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in may 2008  in bonn  germany  22   the tenth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place in october 2010  in nagoya  japan  1   leading up to the conference of the parties  cop 11  meeting on biodiversity in hyderabad  india 2012  preparations for a world wide views on biodiversity has begun  involving old and new partners and building on the experiences from the world wide views on global warming  23   under the theme   biodiversity for sustainable development   thousands of representatives of governments  ngos  indigenous peoples  scientists and the private sector gathered in pyeongchang  republic of korea in october 2014 for the 12th meeting of the conference of the parties to the convention on biological diversity  cop 12).[24   from 6\u201317 october 2014  parties discussed the implementation of the strategic plan for biodiversity 2011-2020 and its aichi biodiversity targets  which are to be achieved by the end of this decade  the results of global biodiversity outlook 4  the flagship assessment report of the cbd informed the discussions   the conference gave a mid-term evaluation to the un decade on biodiversity (2011-2020  initiative  which aims to promote the conservation and sustainable use of nature   at the end of the meeting  the meeting adopted the  pyeongchang road map   which addresses ways to achieve biodiversity through technology cooperation  funding and strengthening the capacity of developing countries  25   the thirteenth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention is taking place between 2 and 17 december 2016 in cancun  mexico   2010 was the international year of biodiversity  the secretariat of the convention on biological diversity is the focal point for the international year of biodiversity  on 22 december 2010  the un declared the period from 2011 to 2020 as the united nations decade on biodiversity  they  hence  followed a recommendation of the cbd signatories during cop10 at nagoya in october 2010   although the convention explicitly states that all forms of life are covered by its provisions  26  examination of reports and of national biodiversity strategies and action plans submitted by participating countries shows that in practice this is not happening  the fifth report of the european union  for example  makes frequent reference to animals  particularly fish  and plants  but does not mention bacteria  fungi or protists at all  27  the international society for fungal conservation has assessed more than 100 of these cbd documents for their coverage of fungi using defined criteria to place each in one of six categories  no documents were assessed as good or adequate  less than 10  as nearly adequate or poor  and the rest as deficient  seriously deficient or totally deficient  28   this article is partly based on the relevant entry in the cia world factbook  as of 2008 update  edition
