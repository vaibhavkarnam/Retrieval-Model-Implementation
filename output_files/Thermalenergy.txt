Thermalenergy
 in thermodynamics  thermal energy refers to the internal energy present in a system due to its temperature  1  the concept is not well-defined or broadly accepted in physics or thermodynamics  because the internal energy can be changed without changing the temperature  and there is no way to distinguish which part of a system s internal energy is  thermal   thermal energy is sometimes used loosely as a synonym for more rigorous thermodynamic quantities such as the  entire  internal energy of a system  or for heat or sensible heat which are defined as types of transfer of energy  just as work is another type of transfer of energy   heat and work depend on the way in which an energy transfer occurred  whereas internal energy is a property of the state of a system and can thus be understood even without knowing how the energy got there       heat is energy transferred spontaneously from a hotter to a colder system or body  2][3  heat is energy in transfer  not a property of the system  it is not  contained  within the boundary of the system  2  on the other hand  internal energy is a property of a system  in an ideal gas  the internal energy is the statistical mean of the kinetic energy of the gas particles  and it is this kinetic motion that is the source and the effect of the transfer of heat across a system boundary  the internal energy of an ideal gas can in this sense be regarded as  thermal energy   in this case  however  thermal energy and internal energy are identical   systems that are more complex than ideal gases  such as real gases  can undergo phase transitions  phase transitions can change the internal energy of the system without changing its temperature  therefore  the thermal energy cannot be defined solely by the temperature  thermal energy also cannot be defined by the difference between the internal energy and the net heat transfer in or out of the system  because it is easy to construct thermodynamic cycles where the system begins and ends in exactly the same state  but there is a net flow of heat in or out during the cycle   for these reasons  the concept of the thermal energy of a system is ill-defined and is not used in thermodynamics   in an 1847 lecture entitled on matter  living force  and heat  james prescott joule characterized various terms that are closely related to thermal energy and heat  he identified the terms latent heat and sensible heat as forms of heat each effecting distinct physical phenomena  namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles  respectively  4  he described latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles  i e  a form of potential energy  and the sensible heat as an energy affecting temperature measured by the thermometer due to the thermal energy  which he called the living force
