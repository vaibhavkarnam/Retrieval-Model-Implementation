Fossilfuelphaseout1
 fossil fuel phase out is the proposed energy transition beyond fossil fuels through multiple means  including transport electrification  fossil fuel divestment  decommissioning of operating fossil fuel-fired power plants and prevention of the construction of new fossil fuel-fired power stations  its purpose is to reduce air pollution  mining tragedies  and greenhouse gas emissions which cause climate change  1  a move to the many forms of renewable energy or nuclear energy is involved in shifting away from fossil fuels       using computer modeling he developed over 20 years  mark z  jacobson has found that carbonaceous fuel soot emissions  which lead to respiratory illness  heart disease  and asthma  have resulted in 1.5 million premature deaths each year  mostly in the developing world where the non-fossil fuels wood and animal dung are used for cooking  jacobson has also said that soot from diesel engines  coal-fired power plants  and burning wood is a  bigger cause of global warming than previously thought  and is the major cause of the rapid melting of the arctic s sea ice   2   in 2011  new evidence has emerged that there are considerable risks associated with traditional energy sources  and that major changes to the mix of energy technologies are needed   several mining tragedies globally have underscored the human toll of the coal supply chain  new epa initiatives targeting air toxics  coal ash  and effluent releases highlight the environmental impacts of coal and the cost of addressing them with control technologies  the use of fracking in natural gas exploration is coming under scrutiny  with evidence of groundwater contamination and greenhouse gas emissions  concerns are increasing about the vast amounts of water used at coal-fired and nuclear power plants  particularly in regions of the country facing water shortages  events at the fukushima nuclear plant have renewed doubts about the ability to operate large numbers of nuclear plants safely over the long term  further  cost estimates for  next generation  nuclear units continue to climb  and lenders are unwilling to finance these plants without taxpayer guarantees  3   in 2008  james hansen and nine other scientists published a journal article titled  target atmospheric co2  where should humanity aim   which calls for a complete phase-out of coal power by 2030.[4   more recently  hansen has stated that continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity s ability to avoid dangerous climate change  5  the letter  co-authored with other climate change experts declared  if we stay on the current path   he said   those are the consequences we ll be leaving to our children  the best candidate to avoid that is nuclear power  it s ready now  we need to take advantage of it   and  continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity s ability to avoid dangerous climate change    also in 2008  pushker kharecha and james hansen published a peer-reviewed scientific study analyzing the effect of a coal phase-out on atmospheric carbon dioxide (co2  levels  6  their baseline mitigation scenario was a phaseout of global coal emissions by 2050  the authors describe the scenario as follows   the second scenario  labeled coal phase-out  is meant to approximate a situation in which developed countries freeze their co2 emissions from coal by 2012 and a decade later developing countries similarly halt increases in coal emissions  between 2025 and 2050 it is assumed that both developed and developing countries will linearly phase out emissions of co2 from coal usage  thus in coal phase-out we have global co2 emissions from coal increasing 2  per year until 2012  1  per year growth of coal emissions between 2013 and 2022  flat coal emissions for 2023\u20132025  and finally a linear decrease to zero co2 emissions from coal in 2050  these rates refer to emissions to the atmosphere and do not constrain consumption of coal  provided the co2 is captured and sequestered  oil and gas emissions are assumed to be the same as in the bau  business as usual  scenario   kharecha and hansen also consider three other mitigation scenarios  all with the same coal phase-out schedule but each making different assumptions about the size of oil and gas reserves and the speed at which they are depleted  under the business as usual scenario  atmospheric co2 peaks at 563 parts per million  ppm  in the year 2100  under the four coal phase-out scenarios  atmospheric co2 peaks at 422-446 ppm between 2045 and 2060 and declines thereafter  the key implications of the study are as follows  a phase-out of coal emissions is the most important remedy for mitigating human-induced global warming  actions should be taken toward limiting or stretching out the use of conventional oil and gas  and strict emissions-based constraints are needed for future use of unconventional fossil fuels such as methane hydrates and tar sands   in the greenpeace and erec s energy  r evolution scenario  7  the world would eliminate all fossil fuel use by 2090.[8][9][10   in december 2015 greenpeace and climate action network europe released a report highlighting the need for an active phase-out of coal-fired generation across europe  their analysis derived from a database of 280 coal plants and included emissions data from official eu registries  11   a september 2016 report by oil change international concludes that the carbon emissions embedded in the coal  oil  and gas in currently working mines and fields  assuming that these run to the end of their working lifetimes  will take the world to just beyond the 2\u202f xb0c limit contained in the 2015 paris agreement and even further from the 1.5\u202f xb0c goal  12][13][14  the report observes that  one of the most powerful climate policy levers is also the simplest  stop digging for more fossil fuels   14]:5  in october 2016  the overseas development institute  odi  and 11 other ngos released a report on the impact of building new coal-fired power plants in countries where a significant proportion of the population lacks access to electricity  the report concludes that  on the whole  building coal-fired power plants does little to help the poor and may make them poorer  moreover  wind and solar generation are beginning to challenge coal on cost  15][16][17   coal is one of the largest sources of energy  supplying 27 percent of the world s primary energy in 2006.[19  coal also accounts for up to one-third of global carbon emissions  citation needed  to decrease carbon emissions and thus possibly stop extreme climate change  some have called for coal to be phased out  20][21  climatologist james e  hansen said  we need a moratorium on coal now   with phase-out of existing plants over the next two decades   22  hans joachim schellnhuber argues that globally coal has to be phased-out until about 2035  if the 2\xa0\xb0c target is taken seriously  23   some nations have decreased their coal consumption thus far in the 21st century  the greatest reductions being in the united states  coal consumption reduced by 176 million metric tons per year over the period 2000-2012   canada  reduced by 21 million tons per year  and spain (20 million tons per year   other nations have increased their coal consumption in the same period  led by china  increased 2,263 million metric tons per year in the period 2000-2012   india  increased 367 million tons per year   and south korea (59 million tons per year   worldwide  coal consumption increased 60  during the period 2000-2012.[24  as of 2012  1200 new coal power plants were reportedly being planned worldwide  most of them in china and india  25  however  coal consumption has peaked in china in 2013 or 2014  depending on the data used and fell in 2015 by 3.6   even though there was a growth of gdp of 6.9%.[26   in the 2011-2013 period  the oecd group of western european countries has increased the use of coal  attributed largely to the low cost of coal and the high price of imported natural gas in western europe  27   according to scientific american  the average coal plant emits more than 100 times as much radiation per year than does a comparatively sized nuclear power plant  in the form of fly ash  28   some like the  coal advisory board  of the iea believe that coal should not be phased out  considering that longer-term global economic growth cannot be achieved without adequate and affordable energy supplies  which will require continuing significant contributions from fossil fuels including coal  in this viewpoint  clean coal technology could reduce greenhouse gas emissions compatible with a low-emissions future  29  some environmentalists and climatologists support a phase-out and criticise clean coal as not a solution to climate change  30  entrepreneurs promote improved regulations and modernised technology  citation needed   in april 2014 ontario canada was the first jurisdiction in north america to eliminate coal in electricity generation  31   the closure of the last coal power station in march 2016 ended coal-fired power production in scotland  32   worldwide natural gas generated power has increased from 740 tw in 1973 to 5140 tw in 2014  generating 22  of the worlds total electricity  approximately half as much as generated with coal  33  during the same period  renewable electricity from wind  solar  geothermal  and biomass grew to 2.2  worldwide  in addition to generating electricity  natural gas is also popular in some countries for heating and as an automotive fuel   the use of coal in the united kingdom declined as a result of the development of north sea oil and the subsequent dash for gas from the 1990s to 2000   in canada some coal power plants such as the hearn generating station have stopped burning coal by switching the plant to natural gas   in the united states  27 gigawatts of capacity from coal-fired generators was slated to be retired from 175 us coal-fired power plants between 2012 and 2016.[34  natural gas showed a corresponding jump  increasing by a third over 2011.[35  coal s share of us electricity generation dropped to just over 36%.[35  due to emergence of shale gas  coal consumption declined from 2009.[36  natural gas accounted for 81  of new power generation in the us between 2000 and 2010.[37  coal-fired generation puts out about twice the amount of carbon dioxide - around 2,000 pounds for every megawatt hour generated - than electricity generated by burning natural gas at 1,100 pounds of greenhouse gas per megawatt hour  as the fuel mix in the united states has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation  carbon dioxide emissions have unexpectedly fallen  those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992.[38    clean burning natural gas  - when compared to the dirtiest fossil fuel coal  burning natural gas for power or heat results in half the carbon dioxide emissions  fracking issues may exist when producing the gas  and if as little as 3 percent of the gas produced escapes  you might as well be burning coal  from a climate perspective  39  natural gas production and distribution leak methane into the atmosphere which may be 25 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide  it has become the darling fossil fuel of environmentalists and is often used to balance the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy when hydroelectricity is not available  40   the twenty leaders of the world s top industrialized nations  as well as key countries with developing economies  have agreed to phase out their subsidies for fossil fuels  including coal  in a concluding statement from the group of 20 (g20  summit u2014held in pittsburgh  pennsylvania  on september 24 and 25  2009 \u2014the nations  leaders agreed to  phase out and rationalize over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies   the g20 leaders also called for targeted support for poor people that would be impacted by higher prices for fossil fuels  the leaders noted that  inefficient  fossil fuel subsidies  encourage wasteful consumption  reduce our energy security  impede investment in clean energy sources  and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change   the agreement will ultimately phase out nearly $300 billion in global subsidies for fossil fuels  and as noted in a white house fact sheet  the organization for economic cooperation and development and the international energy agency estimate that eliminating fossil fuel subsidies worldwide would cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 10  or more by 2050.[41][42][43   despite such pledges  a 2012 report by oil change international which analyzed 2011 spending by the world s wealthy nations found five times as much being spent on fossil fuel subsidies than climate aid  $58 billion was spent in fossil fuel subsidies that year  as compared with $11 billion spent by such nations towards climate adaptation and mitigation in developing countries  with figures for the u s  at $13 billion in fossil fuel subsidies versus $2.5 billion in climate aid for 2011.[44   in november 2015  oecd countries announced another tightening of international coal subsidies  45   the australian greens party have proposed to phase out coal power stations  the nsw greens proposed an immediate moratorium on coal-fired power stations and want to end all coal mining and coal industry subsidies  the australian greens and the australian labor party also oppose nuclear power  the federal government and victorian state government want to modify existing coal-fired power stations into clean coal power stations  citation needed  the federal labor government extended the mandatory renewable energy targets  an initiative to ensure that new sources of electricity are more likely to be from wind power  solar power and other sources of renewable energy in australia  australia is one of the largest consumers of coal per capita  and also the largest exporter  the proposals are strongly opposed by industry  unions 46  and the main opposition party in parliament  now forming the party in government after the september 2013 election    in 2005  canada annually burned 60 million tons of coal  mainly for electrical power  increasing by 15 percent annually   in november 2016  canada announced plans to phase-out coal-fired electricity generation by 2030.[47   beginning in 2005 ontario  canada planned coal phase-out legislation  48  ontario annually consumed 15 million tons of coal in large power plants to supplement nuclear power  nanticoke generating station was a major source of air pollution  and ontario suffered  smog days  during the summer  citation needed  in 2007  ontario s liberal government committed to phasing out all coal generation in the province by 2014  premier dalton mcguinty said   by 2030 there will be about 1,000 more new coal-fired generating stations built on this planet  there is only one place in the world that is phasing out coal-fired generation and we re doing that right here in ontario   49  the ontario power authority projects that in 2014  with no coal generation  the largest sources of electrical power in the province will be nuclear (57 percent   hydroelectricity (25 percent   and natural gas (11 percent   50  the final coal plant in ontario  thunder bay generating station  stopped burning coal in april 2014.[51   there are currently no plans to phase out coal burning power stations in the people s republic of china on the national level   china u2019s exceedingly high energy demand has pushed the demand for relatively cheap coal-fired power  each week  another 2gw of coal-fired power is put online in china  coal supplies about 80  of china s energy needs today  and that ratio is expected to continue  even as overall power usage grows rapidly  serious air quality deterioration has resulted from the massive use of coal and many chinese cities suffer severe smog events  citation needed   as a consequence the region of beijing has decided to phase out all its coal-fired power generation by the end of 2015.[52   needs update   in 2009 china had 172gw of installed hydro capacity the largest in the world  producing 16  of china s electricity  the eleventh five-year plan has set a 300gw target for 2020  china built the world s largest power plant of any kind  the three gorges dam   in addition to the huge investments in coal power  china has 32[53  reactors under construction  the highest number in the world   analysis in 2016 shows that china s coal consumption appears to have peaked in 2014.[54][55   in july 2014  can europe  wwf european policy office  heal  eeb and climate-alliance germany published a report calling for the decommissioning of the thirty most polluting coal-fired power plants in europe  56   hard coal mining has long been subsidized in germany  reaching a peak of \u20ac6.7\xa0billion in 1996 and dropping to \u20ac2.7\xa0billion in 2005 due to falling output  these subsidies represent a burden on public finances and imply a substantial opportunity cost  diverting funds away from other  more beneficial public investments  57   in 2007 germany announced plans to phase out hard coal-industry subsidies by 2018  a move which is expected to end hard coal mining in germany  58][59][60][61][62  this exit is later than the eu-mandated end by 2014.[63  solar and wind are major sources of energy and renewable energy generation  around 15  as of december 2013,[64  and growing  coal is still the largest source of power in germany   in 2007 german chancellor angela merkel and her party agreed to legislation to phase out germany s hard coal mining sector  that does not mean that they support phasing out coal in general  there were plans to build about 25 new plants in the coming years  most german coal power plants were built in the 1960s  and have a low energy efficiency  public sentiment against coal power plants is growing and the construction or planning of some plants has been stopped  58][59][60][61][62  a number are under construction and still being built  no concrete plan is in place to reduce coal-fired electricity generation  as of october 2015  the remaining coal plants still under planning include  niederaussem  profen  and stade  the coal plants currently under construction include  mannheim  hamm d  datteln

year since the low during the 2009 recession  66   a 2014 study finds that coal is not making a comeback in germany  as is sometimes claimed  rather renewables have more than offset the nuclear

contrast  lignite-fired generation is in a safe position until the mid-2020s unless government policies change  to phase-out coal  germany should seek to strength the emissions trading system  eu-ets

country is investing in building massive amounts of new coal-fired capacity to meet power demands  as well as modernizing the existing coal-fired plants to meet environmental requirements   on april 6  2010  the world bank approved a $3.75b loan to south africa to support the construction of the world s 4th largest coal-fired plant  at medupi  85  the proposed world bank loan includes a relatively

18 november 2015 that all coal-fired power stations would close by 2025  this will not be a complete phase out of fossil fuels because new gas-fired power stations will replace them  90   in 2007  154 new coal-fired plants were on the drawing board in 42 states  91  by 2012  that had dropped to 15  mostly due to new rules limiting mercury emissions  and limiting carbon emissions to 1,000 pounds of co2 per megawatt-hour of electricity produced  92   in july 2013  us secretary of energy ernest moniz outlined obama administration policy on fossil fuels   in the last four years  we u2019ve more than doubled renewable energy generation from wind and solar power  however  coal and other fossil fuels still provide 80 percent of our energy  70 percent of our electricity  and will be a major part of our energy future for decades  that u2019s why any serious effort to protect our kids from the worst effects of climate change must also include developing  demonstrating and deploying the technologies to use our abundant fossil fuel resources as cleanly as possible  93   then-us energy secretary stephen chu and researchers for the us national renewable energy laboratory have noted that greater electrical generation by non-dispatchable renewables  such as wind and solar  will also increase the need for flexible natural gas-powered generators  to supply electricity during those times when solar and wind power are unavailable  94][95  gas-powered generators have the ability to ramp up and down quickly to meet changing loads  96   in the us  many of the fossil fuel phase-out initiatives have taken place at the state or local levels   california s sb 1368 created the first governmental moratorium on new coal plants in the united states  the law was signed in september 2006

hydraulic fracturing  while pressing for stricter environmental controls on gas drilling  as a feasible way to replace coal  122  the organization has funded studies jointly with the petroleum industry on the environmental effects of natural gas production  the organization sees natural gas as a way to quickly replace coal  and that natural gas in time will be replaced by renewable energy  123  the policy has been criticized by some environmentalists  124  edf counsel and blogger mark brownstein answered   demand for natural gas is not going away  and neither is hydraulic fracturing  we must be clear-eyed about this  and fight to protect public health and the environment from unacceptable impacts  we must also work hard to put policies in place that ensure that natural gas serves as an enabler of renewable power generation  not an impediment to it  we fear that those who oppose all natural gas production everywhere are  in effect  making it harder for the u s  economy to wean itself from dirty coal   resolved  shareholders request that boa s board of directors amend its ghg emissions policies to observe a moratorium on all financing  investment and further involvement in activities that support mtr coal mining or the construction of new coal-burning power plants that emit carbon dioxide  135   if you re a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now  and not done  i believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration   on 13 october 2007  pocatello  idaho  mayor roger chase told other mayors from across the state attending an association of idaho cities legislative committee that he favored a moratorium no new coal plants in the state  139   on 1 june 2007  park city  utah  mayor dana wilson wrote a letter to warren buffett expressing the city s opposition to three coal plants proposed by rocky mountain power  140   in november 2007  salt lake city mayor rocky anderson expressed his support for a coal moratorium at a rally organized by the step it up  campaign  141   in

energy resolution putting the city on record as supporting a moratorium  citation needed   in january  2008  black hawk county  iowa  health board recommended that the state adopt a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants until it enacts tougher air pollution standards  143   oil is refined into fuel oil  diesel and gasoline  the refined products are primarily consumed by cars  trucks  trains  planes and ships for transportation  popular alternatives are public transport or electric vehicles  which use electricity that may be sourced from renewables or fossil fuels  biofuels produce similar air pollution to fossil fuels and may increase atmospheric methane  a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide   renewable energy is energy that comes from resources which are naturally replenished such as sunlight  wind  rain  tides  waves  and geothermal heat  as of 2014  19  of global final energy consumption comes from renewable resources  with 9  of all energy from traditional biomass  mainly used for heating   1  from biofuels  4  from hydroelectricity and 4  from biomass  geothermal or solar heat   popular renewables  wind  solar  geothermal and biomass for power  accounted for another 1.4  and are growing rapidly  145  while renewable energy supplies are growing and have displaced coal in some regions  the amount of coal burned in 2021  is expected to be the same as it was in 2014.[146   in 2015 hydroelectric energy generated 16.6  of the worlds total electricity and 70  of all renewable electricity  147  in europe and north america environmental concerns around land flooded by large reservoirs ended 30 years of dam construction in the 1990s  since then large dams and reservoirs continue to be built in countries like china  brazil and india  run-of-the-river hydroelectricity and small hydro have become popular alternatives to conventional dams that may create reservoirs in environmentally sensitive areas   a wind farm is a group of wind turbines in the same location used to produce electric power  a large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines  and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles  but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes  a wind farm may also be located offshore   wind power has grown dramatically since 2005 and by 2015 supplied almost 1  of global energy consumption  148   many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in the united states and china  the gansu wind farm in china has over 5,000 mw installed with a goal of 20,000 mw by 2020  china has several other  wind power bases  of similar size  the alta wind energy center in california  united states is the largest onshore wind farm outside of china  with a capacity of 1020 mw of power  149  as of february 2012  the walney wind farm in the united kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 367 mw  followed by thanet offshore wind project (300 mw   also in the united kingdom  as of february 2012  the f xe2nt xe2nele-cogealac wind farm in romania is the largest onshore wind farm in europe at 600 mw  150   there are many large wind farms

denmark produced the equivalent of 42.1  of total electricity consumption in 2015,[151][152  however  use of wind for heating is minor  153][154][155][156   solar heating  solar driven turbines and solar photovoltaic are all rapidly growing in popularity  by 2020 the solar contribution to global final energy consumption will exceed 1%.[157   solar photovoltaic cells convert sunlight into electricity and many solar photovoltaic power stations have been built  the size of these stations has increased progressively over the last decade with frequent new capacity records   as of january 2013  the largest individual photovoltaic  pv  power plants in the world are agua caliente solar project   arizona  over 247\xa0mw connected - to increase to 397\xa0mw   golmud solar park  china

with 500 mw more expected in 2012.[163   many large plants are under construction  the desert sunlight solar farm is a 550 mw solar power plant under construction in riverside county  california  that will use thin-film solar photovoltaic modules made by first solar  164  the topaz solar farm is a 550 mw photovoltaic power plant  being built in san luis obispo county  california  165  the blythe solar power project is a 500 mw photovoltaic station under construction in riverside county  california  the agua caliente solar project is a 290 megawatt photovoltaic solar generating facility being built in yuma county  arizona  the california valley solar ranch  cvsr  is a 250\xa0megawatt  mw  solar photovoltaic power plant  which is being built by sunpower in the carrizo plain  northeast of california valley  166  the 230 mw antelope valley solar ranch is a first solar photovoltaic project which is under construction in the antelope valley area of the western mojave desert  and due to be completed in 2013.[167   many of these plants are integrated with agriculture and some use innovative tracking systems that follow the sun s daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed-mounted systems  solar power plants have no fuel costs or emissions during operation   concentrating solar power  csp  systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam  the concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant  a wide range of concentrating technologies exists  the most developed are the parabolic trough  the concentrating linear fresnel reflector  the stirling dish and the solar power tower  various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light  in all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight  and is then used for power generation or energy storage  169   carbon-neutral fuels are fuels that use as much or more carbon dioxide in their production as they release in burning  they may be produced by hydrogenating waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue-gas emissions  recovered from automotive exhaust gas  or derived from carbonic acid in seawater  170  commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce synthetic fuels for less than petroleum fuels when oil costs more than $55 per barrel  171  renewable methanol  rm  is a fuel produced from hydrogen and carbon dioxide by catalytic hydrogenation where the hydrogen has been obtained from water electrolysis  it can be blended into transportation fuel or processed as a chemical feedstock  172   the george olah carbon dioxide recycling plant operated by carbon recycling international in grindav xedk  iceland has been producing 2 million liters of methanol transportation fuel per year from flue exhaust of the svartsengi power station since 2011.[173  it has the capacity to produce 5 million liters per year  174  a 250 kilowatt methane synthesis plant was constructed by the center for solar energy and hydrogen research  zsw  at baden-w xfcrttemberg and the fraunhofer society in germany and began operating in 2010  it is being upgraded to 10 megawatts  scheduled for completion in autumn  2012.[175][176  audi has constructed a carbon-neutral liquefied natural gas  lng  plant in werlte  germany  177  the plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset lng used in their a3 sportback g-tron automobiles  and can keep 2,800 metric tons of co2 out of the environment per year at its initial capacity  178  other commercial developments are taking place in columbia  south carolina  179  camarillo  california  180  and darlington  england  181   such fuels are considered carbon-neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases  182  to the extent that synthetic fuels displace fossil fuels  or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid  183  and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe  they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere  and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation  184   such renewable fuels alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels  enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles  185   in the usa  nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel  because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day  but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day  so the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative   in europe  the situation is usually opposite \u2013 winds blow more during the day and winter  coinciding with consumption  germany has built a 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant which they are scaling up to 10 megawatts  175][176][186   biofuels  in the form of liquid fuels derived from plant materials  are entering the market  however  many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the natural environment  food security  and land use  187][188   biomass is biological material from living  or recently living organisms  most often referring to plants or plant-derived materials  189  as a renewable energy source  biomass can either be used directly  or indirectly u2014once or converted into another type of energy product such as biofuel  biomass can be converted to energy in three ways  thermal conversion  chemical conversion  and biochemical conversion   using biomass as a fuel produces air pollution in the form of carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide  nox  nitrogen oxides   vocs  volatile organic compounds   particulates and other pollutants at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas in some cases  such as with indoor heating and cooking   190][191][192  utilization of wood biomass as a fuel can also produce fewer particulate and other pollutants than open burning as seen in wildfires or direct heat applications  193  black carbon \u2013 a pollutant created by combustion of fossil fuels  biofuels  and biomass \u2013 is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming  194]:56\u201357 in 2009 a swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in south asia determined that it had been principally produced by biomass burning  and to a lesser extent by fossil fuel burning  195  denmark has increased the use of biomass and garbage  196  and decreased the use of coal  197   moving away from fossil fuels will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied  but in the way it is used  and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential  opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side  and often offer significant economic benefits  198   a sustainable energy economy requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency  renewable energy and energy efficiency are said to be the  twin pillars  of sustainable energy policy  the american council for an energy-efficient economy has explained that both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions  199   efficiency is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use  if energy use grows too fast  renewable energy development will chase a receding target  likewise  unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly  slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions  reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed  199   the iea has stated that renewable energy and energy efficiency policies are complementary tools for the development of a sustainable energy future  and should be developed together instead of being developed in isolation  200   the 2014 intergovernmental panel on climate change report identifies nuclear energy as one of the technologies that can provide electricity with less than 5  of the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal power  201  there are more than 60 nuclear reactors shown as under construction in the list of nuclear power by country with china leading at 23  globally  more nuclear power reactors have closed than opened in recent years but overall capacity has increased  202  china has stated its plans to double nuclear generation by 2030  india also plans to greatly increase its nuclear power   several countries have enacted laws to cease construction on new nuclear power stations  several european countries have debated nuclear phase-outs and others have completely shut down some reactors  three nuclear accidents have influenced the slowdown of nuclear power  the 1979 three mile island accident in the united states  the 1986 chernobyl disaster in the ussr  and the 2011 fukushima nuclear disaster in japan  following the march 2011 fukushima nuclear disaster  germany has permanently shut down eight of its 17 reactors and pledged to close the rest by the end of 2022.[203  italy voted overwhelmingly to keep their country non-nuclear  204  switzerland and spain have banned the construction of new reactors  205  japan u2019s prime minister has called
