Environmentaltariff
 an eco-tariff  also known as an environmental tariff  is an import or export tax placed on products being imported from  or also being sent to countries with substandard environmental pollution controls  they can be used as controls on global pollution and can also be considered as corrective measures against  environmental races to the bottom  and "eco-dumping   1   the result of these eco-tariffs is the increase in environmentally preferable products (epp u2019s  environmentally preferable products are \u201cproducts which cause significantly less environmental harm at some stage of their life cycle than alternative products that serve the same purpose        there has been debate on the role that increased international trade has played in increasing pollution  2  while some maintain that increases in pollution which result in both local environmental degradation and a global tragedy of the commons are intimately linked to increases in international trade  others have argued that as citizens become more affluent they ll also advocate for cleaner environments  according to a world bank paper   proponents of environmental tariff implementation have highlighted that if implemented correctly  the tariff could serve to stop strategic behavior of foreign nations and return efficient economic policy in the foreign country  additionally  environmental standards will be harmonized between the trading nations as a result of the environmental tariff  5   one of the major issues that are raised when discussing environmental tariffs  is the issue of a reduction in trade  the argument raised is that tariffs reduce trade and may not actually be targeting the actual source of the pollution  they argue that pollution is not just as a result of imported goods but a large part of pollution suffered occurs within the borders of a country  therefore trade would merely harming trade without actually addressing the root cause effectively   although the united states has in the past been accused of dragging its feet on implementing tough new anti-pollution measures  it was the originator of a legislative proposal suggesting an environmental tariff be applied against exporting countries whose exports gained significant cost advantages due to less stringent environmental regulations  the proposed legislation was tabled as the international pollution deterrence act of 1991 and was introduced in its senate in april of that year  6   negotiations took place in 2001 doha  qatar towards the improvement of work related issues concerning the implementation of present agreements  this was a mandated conference dubbed the fourth ministerial conference  one of the issues discussed concerned the issues of trade barriers on environmental goods and services  the result of which was ministers agreeing to a reduction or complete removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services such as catalytic converters and air filters to name a few   a notable feature of the proposed u s  international pollution deterrence act was the international pollution control index it cited within its section 5  which read  7   international pollution control index  section 8002 of the solid waste disposal act (42 u s c  6982  is amended by adding the following new subsections at the end thereof   more positives of environmental tariffs is that they result in the movement in production of goods  to areas in which stricter environmental standards are enforced environment tariffs were not implemented in the past  in part  because they were not sanctioned by multilateral trade regimes such as the world trade organization and within the general agreement on tariffs and trade  gatt   a fact which generated considerable criticism and calls for reform  1   moreover  the gatt does condone the use of tariffs as market interventions  so long as the interventions do not discriminate products  both foreign and domestic  a disputed case relating to this policy was brought forth to the gatt wto  involving the u s  and canada over canadian environmental regulations on beverage containers   additionally  many foreign factory owners in newly industrialized countries and underdeveloped countries saw the attempts to impose pollution controls on them as suspicious     moreover  the problem of what the ideal tariff level is also a cause for concern when implementing environmental tariffs   further implementation problems have been as a result of what some developing nations may view as green protectionism  green protectionism being the use of methods meant to address legitimate environment goals for the end goal of protection
