Sustainablematerialsmanagement
 sustainable materials management is a systemic approach to using and reusing materials more productively over their entire lifecycles  it represents a change in how a society thinks about the use of natural resources and environmental protection  by looking at a product s entire lifecycle new opportunities can be found to reduce environmental impacts  conserve resources  and reduce costs  1  u s  and global consumption of materials increased rapidly during the last century  according to the annex to the g7 leaders u2019 june 8  2015 declaration  global raw material use rose during the 20th century at about twice the rate of population growth  for every 1 percent increase in gross domestic product  raw material use has risen by 0.4 percent  2  this increasing consumption has come at a cost to the environment  including habitat destruction  biodiversity loss  overly stressed fisheries and desertification  materials management is also associated with an estimated 42 percent of total u s  greenhouse gas emissions  failure to find more productive and sustainable ways to extract  use and manage materials  and change the relationship between material consumption and growth  has grave implications for our economy and society       sustainable materials management  smm  represents a framework to sustainably manage materials and products throughout the entire lifecycle  from resource extraction  design and manufacturing  resource productivity  consumption and end-of-life management   traditional patterns of material consumption in the united states follow a cradle-to-grave pattern of raw material extraction  product manufacturing  distribution to consumers  use by consumers  and disposal  coined by the story of stuff author annie leonard as the  take-make-waste  linear economy and commonly referred to as the throw-away society  4  these familiar waste management practices are being revised to bring about sustainable management of resources  smm represents a shift in how materials are used and valued with a focus on the environmental impact of material use and environmental protection throughout the entire lifecycle of a product  smm has been adopted as a regulatory approach to manage materials by the u s  environmental protection agency  epa  and many other governments around the world   sustainable materials management is a broad approach that overlaps and supplements many programs and concepts being adopted by governments and business around the world including zero waste  green chemistry  eco-labeling  sustainable supply-chain management  lean manufacturing  green procurement  the us epa u2019s design for the environment program  the g8\u2019s 3r u2019s  reduce  reuse  recycle  program  unep u2019s sustainable production and consumption and sustainable resource management programs  and oecd u2019s sustainable materials management framework  5   there are several similar and overlapping efforts to define and conceptualize a closed loop lifecycle of product and materials management  with many of these efforts being spear headed by government agencies  entrepreneurs  scientists and non-governmental organizations  while similar to smm  these product lifecycle models focus largely on the end-of-life management of materials while smm focuses on the impacts materials  products and services have on the environment such as eutrophication  acidification  ozone layer depletion  global warming and aquatic toxicity as well as energy and water use  5   the product stewardship institute defines product stewardship as    the act of minimizing the health  safety  environmental  and social impacts of a product and its packaging throughout all lifecycle stages  while also maximizing economic benefits  the manufacturer  or producer  of the product has the greatest ability to minimize adverse impacts  but other stakeholders  such as suppliers  retailers  and consumers  also play a role  stewardship can be either voluntary or required by law   7   british columbia  bc  has an extensive product stewardship network administered by bc recycles and comprised of bc producers and brand owners who have a requirement by law to collect and divert end-of-life products and packaging in order to comply with british columbia recycling regulations  8   the u ks waste and resource action programme  wrap  defines the circular economy as being an alternative to the traditional take  make  waste economy to one that keeps resources in use as long as possible  extracts the maximum value from the materials while they are in use  then recovers the materials to generate new products at the end of the service life  9   the ellen macarthur foundation works to accelerate the transition to a circular economy by working with businesses  academia and governments throughout the world to develop an economy that is restorative and regenerative by design and seeks to keep products  components and materials at their highest use and value at all times  distinguishing between biological and technical cycles  10   the dictionary of sustainable management defines cradle-to-cradle as   a phrase invented by walter r  stahel in the 1970s and popularized by william mcdonough and michael braungart in their 2002 book of the same name  this framework seeks to create production techniques that are not just efficient but are essentially waste free  in cradle-to-cradle production  all material inputs and outputs are seen either as technical or biological nutrients  technical nutrients can be recycled or reused with no loss of quality and biological nutrients composted or consumed  by contrast cradle-to-grave refers to a company taking responsibility for the disposal of goods it has produced  but not necessarily putting products u2019 constituent components back into service   [11   in closed loop recycling  a material is captured at the end of life and introduced back into the manufacturing process to make a new product [12   the organization for economic co-operation and development  oecd  formed in 1960 and currently comprising 35 member countries including the united states  canada  mexico  japan and 23 countries in the european union  13  works to foster economic prosperity and end poverty by promoting economic growth and financial stability for governments around the world while also taking into account the implications that economic and social growth have on the environment  14   since the 1980\u2019s  the oecd has worked to promote policies that prevent  reduce and manage waste in ways that mitigate environmental impacts  it has become clear over time that increasing economic activity and materials consumptions calls for a systematic materials based approach to managing waste  one that seeks to incorporate materials back into the manufacturing process at the end of their life  in what is commonly referred to as a \u201ccradle to cradle u201d approach to materials management as opposed to the traditional \u201ccradle to grave u201d waste management approach  around 2001 the oecd began to address many countries u2019 interest in viewing waste as a resource that can be used as inputs for new products and many countries and governments have begun adopting sustainable materials management policies  15   in 2012  the oecd put out a green growth policy brief on sustainable materials management  in it they define smm as  \u201c u2026an approach to promote sustainable materials use  integrating actions targeted at reducing negative environmental impacts and preserving natural capital throughout the life-cycle of materials  taking into account economic efficiency and social equity u201d  16   the oecd working definition includes the following notes on the definition of smm  16   sustainable production and consumption  unep   sustainable resource management  unep   the us epa has adopted sustainable materials management as a regulatory framework for managing materials  in june 2009 the epa put out a report that functioned as a road map to smm in the u s  titled sustainable materials management - the road ahead 2009 - 2020  in this report  epa defines smm as  \u201c    an approach to serving human needs by using reusing resources productively and sustainably throughout their life cycles  generally minimizing the amount of materials involved and all associated environmental impacts u201d  17   the resource conservation and recovery act  rcra  sets the legislative basis for ssm in the united states  establishing a preference for resource conservation over disposal  in 2010  the office of resource conservation and recovery shifted focus from just resource recovery efforts to adopt a broader sustainable materials management approach  the new approach includes the two original waste management mandates of rcra  1  to protect human health and the environment from waste and 2  to conserve resources  and adds in three additional goals  1  to \u201creduce waste and increase the efficient and sustainable use of resources u201d  2  \u201cprevent exposures to humans and ecosystems from the use of hazardous chemicals u201d 3  \u201cmanage wastes and clean up chemical releases in a safe  environmentally sound manner u201d  18   in 2015 epa published the report epa sustainable materials management program strategic plan for fiscal years 2017 \u2013 2022  this five year plan will focus on three strategic initiatives   other areas the epa will focus on include sustainable electronics management  life-cycle assessment  measurement  and international smm collaboration  18
