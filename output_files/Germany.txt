documented before 100\xa0ad  during the migration period the germanic tribes expanded southward  beginning in the 10th century  german territories formed a central part of the holy roman empire  11  during the 16th century  northern german regions became the centre of the protestant reformation   in 1871  germany became a nation state when most of the german states unified into the prussian-dominated german empire  after world war i and the german revolution of 1918\u20131919  the empire was replaced by the parliamentary weimar republic  the establishment of the national socialist dictatorship led by adolf hitler in 1933 led to world war ii and the holocaust  after a period of allied occupation  two german states were founded  the federal republic of germany  commonly known as west germany  and the german democratic republic  commonly known as east germany   in 1990  the country was reunified  12   in the 21st century  germany is a great power and has the world s

 germany has been continuously the home of influential artists  philosophers  musicians  sportspeople  entrepreneurs  scientists  engineers  and inventors       the english word germany derives from the latin germania  which came into use after julius caesar adopted it for the peoples east of the rhine  14  the german term deutschland  originally diutisciu land   the german lands   is derived from deutsch  cf  dutch   descended from old high german diutisc  popular   i e  belonging to the diot or diota  people    originally used to distinguish the language of the common people from latin

*tewt xe9h u2082-  people   from which the word  teutons  also originates  15   the discovery of the mauer 1 mandible shows that ancient humans were present in germany at least 600,000 years ago  16  the oldest complete hunting weapons found anywhere in the world were discovered in a coal mine in sch xf6ningen where three 380,000-year-old wooden javelins were unearthed  17  the neander valley was the location where the first ever non-modern human fossil was discovered  the new species of human was called the neanderthal  the neanderthal 1 fossils are known to be 40,000 years old  evidence of modern humans  similarly dated  has been found in caves in the swabian jura near ulm  the finds include 42,000-year-old bird bone and mammoth ivory flutes which are the oldest musical instruments ever

world programme  21   the germanic tribes are thought to date from the nordic bronze age or the pre-roman iron age  from southern scandinavia and north germany  they expanded south  east and west from the 1st century xa0bc  coming into contact with the celtic tribes of gaul as well as iranian  baltic  and slavic tribes in central and eastern europe  22  under augustus  rome began to invade germania  an area extending roughly from the rhine to the ural mountains   in 9\xa0ad  three roman legions led by varus were defeated by the cheruscan leader arminius  by 100\xa0ad  when tacitus wrote germania  germanic tribes had settled along the rhine and the danube  the limes germanicus   occupying most of the area of modern germany  austria  baden w xfcrttemberg  southern bavaria  southern hessen and the western rhineland  however  were roman provinces  23   in the 3rd century a number of large west germanic tribes emerged  alemanni  franks  chatti  saxons  frisii  sicambri  and thuringii  around 260  the germanic peoples broke into roman-controlled lands  24  after the invasion of the huns in 375  and with the decline of rome from 395  germanic tribes moved further south-west  simultaneously several large tribes formed in what is now germany and displaced or absorbed smaller germanic tribes  large areas known since the merovingian period as austrasia  neustria  and aquitaine were conquered by the franks who established the frankish kingdom  and pushed further east to subjugate saxony and bavaria  areas of what is today the eastern part of germany were inhabited by western slavic tribes of sorbs  veleti and the obotritic confederation  23   in 800  the frankish king charlemagne was crowned emperor and founded the carolingian empire  which was later divided in 843 among his heirs  25  following the break up of the frankish realm  for 900 years  the history of germany was intertwined with the history of the holy roman empire  26  which subsequently emerged from the eastern portion of charlemagne s original empire  the territory initially known as east francia stretched from the rhine in the west to the elbe river in the east and from the north sea to the alps  25   the ottonian rulers (919\u20131024  consolidated several major duchies and the german king otto i was crowned holy roman emperor of these regions in 962  in 996 gregory v became the first german pope  appointed by his cousin otto iii  whom he shortly after crowned holy roman emperor  the holy roman empire absorbed northern italy and burgundy under the reign of the salian emperors (1024\u20131125   although the emperors lost power through the investiture controversy  27   in the 12th century  under the hohenstaufen emperors (1138\u20131254   german princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by slavs  they encouraged german settlement in these areas  called the eastern settlement movement  ostsiedlung   members of the hanseatic league  which included mostly north german cities and towns  prospered in the expansion of trade  28  in the south  the greater ravensburg trade corporation  gro xdfe ravensburger handelsgesellschaft  served a similar function  the edict of the golden bull issued in 1356 by emperor charles iv provided the basic constitutional structure of the empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven prince-electors who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics  29   population declined in the first half of the 14th century  starting with the great famine in 1315  followed by the black death of 1348\u201350.[30  despite the decline  however  german artists  engineers  and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city-states as venice  florence and genoa  artistic and cultural centres throughout the german states produced such artists as the augsburg painters hans holbein and his son  and albrecht d xfcrer  johannes gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to europe  a development that laid the basis for the spread of learning to the masses  31   in 1517  the wittenberg monk martin luther publicised the ninety-five theses  challenging the roman catholic church and initiating the protestant reformation  in 1555  the peace of augsburg established lutheranism as an acceptable alternative to catholicism  but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects  a principle called cuius regio  eius religio  the agreement at augsburg failed to address other religious creed  for example  the reformed faith was still considered a heresy and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler  such as happened in electorate of cologne in 1583  from the cologne war until the end of the thirty years  wars (1618\u20131648   religious conflict devastated german lands  32  the latter reduced the overall population of the german states by about 30 per cent  and in some places  up to 80 per cent  33  the peace of westphalia ended religious warfare among the german states  32  german rulers were able to choose either roman catholicism  lutheranism or the reformed faith as their official religion after 1648.[34   in the 18th century  the holy roman empire consisted of approximately 1,800 territories  35  the elaborate legal system initiated by a series of imperial reforms  approximately 1450\u20131555  created the imperial estates and provided for considerable local autonomy among ecclesiastical  secular  and hereditary states  reflected in imperial diet  the house of habsburg held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of charles vi in 1740  having no male heirs  he had convinced the electors to retain habsburg hegemony in the office of the emperor by agreeing to the pragmatic sanction  this was finally settled through the war of austrian succession  in the treaty of aix-la-chapelle  maria theresa s husband became holy roman emperor  and she ruled the empire as empress consort  from 1740  the dualism between the austrian habsburg monarchy and the kingdom of prussia dominated the german history   in 1772  then again in 1793 and 1795  the two dominant german states of prussia and austria  along with the russian empire  agreed to the partitions of poland  dividing among themselves the lands of the polish u2013lithuanian commonwealth  as a result of the partitions  millions of polish speaking inhabitants fell under the rule of the two german monarchies  however  the annexed territories though incorporated into the kingdom of prussia and the habsburg realm  were not legally considered as a part of the holy roman empire  36][37   during the period of the french revolutionary wars  along with the arrival of the napoleonic era and the subsequent final meeting of the imperial diet  most of the secular free imperial cities were annexed by dynastic territories  the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed  in 1806 the imperium was dissolved  german states  particularly the rhineland states  fell under the influence of france  until 1815  france  russia  prussia and the habsburgs competed for hegemony in the german states during the napoleonic wars  38   following the fall of napoleon  the congress of vienna  convened in 1814  founded the german confederation  deutscher bund   a loose league of 39 sovereign states  the appointment of the emperor of austria as the permanent president of the confederation reflected the congress s failure to accept prussia s influence among the german states  and acerbated the long-standing competition between the hohenzollern and habsburg interests  disagreement within restoration politics partly led to the rise of liberal movements  followed by new measures of repression by austrian statesman metternich  the zollverein  a tariff union  furthered economic unity in the german states  39  national and liberal ideals of the french revolution gained increasing support among many  especially young  germans  the hambach festival in may 1832 was a main event in support of german unity  freedom and democracy  in the light of a series of revolutionary movements in europe  which established a republic in france  intellectuals and commoners started the revolutions of 1848 in the german states  king frederick william iv of prussia was offered the title of emperor  but with a loss of power  he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution  leading to a temporary setback for the movement  40   king william i appointed otto von bismarck as the new minister president of prussia in 1862  bismarck successfully concluded war on denmark in 1864  which promoted german over danish interests in the jutland peninsula  the subsequent  and decisive  prussian victory in the austro-prussian war of 1866 enabled him to create the north german confederation  norddeutscher bund  which excluded austria from the federation s affairs  after the french defeat in the franco-prussian war  the german princes proclaimed the founding of the german empire in 1871 at versailles  uniting all scattered parts of germany except austria  prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire  the hohenzollern king of prussia ruled as its concurrent emperor  and berlin became its capital  40   in the gr xfcnderzeit period following the unification of germany  bismarck s foreign policy as chancellor of germany under emperor william i secured germany s position as a great nation by forging alliances  isolating france by diplomatic means  and avoiding war  under wilhelm ii  germany  like other european powers  took an imperialistic course  leading to friction with neighbouring countries  most alliances in which germany had previously been involved were not renewed  this resulted in creation of a dual alliance with the multinational realm of austria-hungary  promoting at least benevolent neutrality if not outright military support  subsequently  the triple alliance of 1882 included italy  completing a central european geographic alliance that illustrated german  austrian and italian fears of incursions against them by france and or russia  similarly  britain  france and russia also concluded alliances that would protect them against habsburg interference with russian interests in the balkans or german interference against france  41   at the berlin conference in 1884  germany claimed several colonies including german east africa  german south west africa  togoland  and kamerun  42  later  germany further expanded its colonial empire to include german new guinea  german micronesia and german samoa in the pacific  and kiautschou bay in china  in what became known as the  first genocide of the twentieth-century   between 1904 and 1907  the german colonial government in south west africa  present-day namibia  ordered the annihilation of the local herero and namaqua peoples  as a punitive measure for an uprising against german colonial rule  in total  around 100,000 people u201480  of the herero and 50  of the namaqua u2014perished from imprisonment in concentration camps  where the majority died of disease  abuse  and exhaustion  or from dehydration and starvation in the countryside after being deprived of food and water  43][44   the assassination of austria s crown prince on 28 june 1914 provided the pretext for the austrian empire to attack serbia and trigger world war i  after four years of warfare  in which approximately two million german soldiers were killed  45  a general armistice ended the fighting on 11 november  and german troops returned home  in the german revolution  november 1918   emperor wilhelm ii and all german ruling princes abdicated their positions and responsibilities  germany s new political leadership signed the treaty of versailles in 1919  in this treaty  germany  as part of the central powers  accepted defeat by the allies in one of the bloodiest conflicts of all time  germans perceived the treaty as humiliating and unjust and it was later seen by historians as influential in the rise of adolf hitler  46][47][48  after the defeat in the first world war  germany lost around 13  of its european territory  areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic polish  french and danish populations  which were lost following the greater poland uprising  the return of alsace-lorraine and the schleswig plebiscites   and all of its colonial possessions in africa and the south sea  49   germany was declared a republic at the beginning of the german revolution in november 1918  on 11 august 1919 president friedrich ebert signed the democratic weimar constitution  50  in the subsequent struggle for power  the radical-left communists seized power in bavaria  but conservative elements in other parts of germany attempted to overthrow the republic in the kapp putsch  it was supported by parts of the reichswehr  military  and other conservative  nationalistic and monarchist factions  after a tumultuous period of bloody street fighting in the major industrial centres  the occupation of the ruhr by belgian and french troops and the rise of inflation culminating in the hyperinflation of 1922\u201323  a debt restructuring plan and the creation of a new currency in 1924 ushered in the golden twenties  an era of increasing artistic innovation and liberal cultural life  underneath it all  though  lay a current of animosity and frustration over the treaty of versailles  widely perceived as a stab in the back  which provided the basis of much of the anti-semitism rife in the next two decades  51  the economic situation remained volatile  historians describe the period between 1924 and 1929 as one of  partial stabilisation   52  the worldwide great depression hit germany in 1929  after the federal election of 1930  chancellor heinrich br xfcning s government was enabled by president paul von hindenburg to act without parliamentary approval  br xfcning s government pursued a policy of fiscal austerity and deflation which caused high unemployment of nearly 30  by 1932.[53   the nazi party led by adolf hitler won the special federal election of 1932  after a series of unsuccessful cabinets  hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor of germany in 1933.[54  after the reichstag fire  a decree abrogated basic civil rights and within weeks the first nazi concentration camp at dachau opened  55][56  the enabling act of 1933 gave hitler unrestricted legislative power  subsequently  his government established a centralised totalitarian state  withdrew from the league of nations following a national referendum  and began military rearmament  57   using deficit spending  a government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works projects  in public work projects of 1934  1.7 million germans immediately were put to work  which gave them an income and social benefits  58  the most famous of the projects was the high speed roadway  the reichsautobahn  known as the german autobahns  59  other capital construction projects included hydroelectric facilities such as the rur dam  water supplies such as zillierbach dam  and transportation hubs such as zwickau hauptbahnhof  60  over the next five years  unemployment plummeted and average wages both per hour and per week rose  61   in 1935  the regime withdrew from the treaty of versailles and introduced the nuremberg laws which targeted jews and other minorities  germany also reacquired control of the saar in 1935,[62  annexed austria in 1938  and despite the munich agreement  occupied czechoslovakia in early 1939   kristallnacht  or the  night of broken glass   saw the burning of hundreds of synagogues  the destruction of thousands of jewish businesses  and the arrest of around 30,000 jewish men by nazi forces inside germany  many jewish women were arrested and placed in jails and a curfew was placed on the jewish people in germany  63   in august 1939  hitler s government negotiated and signed the molotov u2013ribbentrop pact that divided eastern europe into german and soviet spheres of influence  following the agreement  on 1 september 1939  germany invaded poland  marking the beginning of world war ii  64][65   in response to hitler s actions  britain and france declared war on germany  66  in the spring of 1940  germany conquered denmark and norway  the netherlands  belgium  luxembourg  and france forcing the french government to sign an armistice after german troops occupied most of the country  the british repelled german air attacks in the battle of britain in the same year  in 1941  german troops invaded yugoslavia  greece and the soviet union  by 1942  germany and other axis powers controlled most of continental europe and north africa  but following the soviet union s victory at the battle of stalingrad  the allies  reconquest of north africa and invasion of italy in 1943  german forces suffered repeated military defeats  64  in june 1944  the western allies landed in france and the soviets pushed into eastern europe  by late 1944  the western allies had entered germany despite one final german counter offensive in the ardennes forest  following hitler s suicide during the battle of berlin  german armed forces surrendered on 8 may 1945  ending world war ii in europe  67  after world war ii  former members of the nazi regime were tried for war crimes at the nuremberg trials  68][69   in what later became known as the holocaust  the german government persecuted minorities and used a network of concentration and death camps across europe to conduct a genocide of what they considered to be inferior peoples  in total  over 10 million civilians were systematically murdered  including 6 million jews  between 220,000 and 1,500,000 romani  275,000 persons with disabilities  thousands of jehovah s witnesses  thousands of homosexuals  and hundreds of thousands of members of the political and religious opposition from germany  and occupied countries  nacht und nebel   70  nazi policies in the german occupied countries resulted in the deaths of 2.7 million poles  71  1.3 million ukrainians  72  and an estimated 2.8 million soviet war prisoners  72][68  in addition  the nazi regime abducted approximately 12 million people from across the german occupied europe for use as slave labour in the german industry  73  german military war casualties were estimated at between 3.2 million and 5.3 million soldiers  74  and up to 2 million german civilians  75  german territorial losses resulted in the expulsion of circa 12 million of ethnic germans from eastern europe  germany ceded roughly one-quarter of its pre-war territory  12  strategic bombing and land warfare destroyed many cities and cultural heritage sites   after germany surrendered  the allies partitioned berlin and germany s remaining territory into four military occupation zones  the western sectors  controlled by france  the united kingdom  and the united states  were merged on 23 may 1949 to form the federal republic of germany  bundesrepublik deutschland   on 7 october 1949  the soviet zone became the german democratic republic  deutsche demokratische republik   they were informally known as west germany and east germany  east germany selected east berlin as its capital  while west germany chose bonn as a provisional capital  to emphasize its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo  76   west germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a  social market economy   starting in 1948 west germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the marshall plan and used this to rebuild its industry  77  konrad adenauer was elected the first federal chancellor  bundeskanzler  of germany in 1949 and remained in office until 1963  under his and ludwig erhard s leadership  the country enjoyed prolonged economic growth beginning in the early 1950s  that became known as an  economic miracle  (wirtschaftswunder   78  west germany joined nato in 1955 and was a founding member of the european economic community in 1957   east germany was an eastern bloc state under political and military control by the ussr via occupation forces and the warsaw pact  although east germany claimed to be a democracy  political power was exercised solely by leading members  politb xfcro  of the communist-controlled socialist unity party of germany  supported by the stasi  an immense secret service controlling many aspects of the society  79  a soviet-style command economy was set up and the gdr later became a comecon state  80  while east german propaganda was based on the benefits of the gdr s social programmes and the alleged constant threat of a west german invasion  many of its citizens looked to the west for freedom and prosperity  81  the berlin wall  rapidly built on august 13  1961 prevented east german citizens from escaping to west germany  eventually becoming a symbol of the cold war  40][82  ronald reagan s  mr  gorbachov  tear down this wall   speech at the wall on june 12  1987 influenced public opinion echoing john f  kennedy s famous ich bin ein berliner speech of 26 june 1963  the fall of the wall in 1989 became a symbol of the fall of communism the dissolution of the soviet union  german reunification and die wende  83   tensions between east and west germany were reduced in the early 1970s by chancellor willy brandt s ostpolitik  in summer 1989  hungary decided to dismantle the iron curtain and open the borders  causing the emigration of thousands of east germans to west germany via hungary  this had devastating effects on the gdr  where regular mass demonstrations received increasing support  the east german authorities eased the border restrictions  allowing east german citizens to travel to the west  originally intended to help retain east germany as a state  the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the wende reform process  this culminated in the two plus four treaty a year later on 12 september 1990  under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the instrument of surrender  and germany regained full sovereignty  this permitted german reunification on 3 october 1990  with the accession of the five re-established states of the former gdr  40   the united germany is considered to be the enlarged continuation of the federal republic of germany and not a successor state  as such  it retained all of west germany s memberships in international organisations  85  based on the berlin bonn act  adopted in 1994  berlin once again became the capital of the reunified germany  while bonn obtained the unique status of a bundesstadt  federal city  retaining some federal ministries  86  the relocation of the government was completed in 1999.[87  following the 1998 elections  spd politician gerhard schr xf6der became the first chancellor of a red

signed the maastricht treaty in 1992  established the eurozone in 1999  and signed the lisbon treaty in 2007.[89  germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the balkans and sent a force of german troops to afghanistan as part of a nato effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the taliban  90  these deployments were controversial since germany was bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles  91   in the 2005 elections  angela merkel became the first female chancellor of germany as the leader of a grand coalition  40  in 2009 the german government approved a \u20ac50\xa0billion economic stimulus plan to protect several sectors from a downturn  92   in 2009  a liberal-conservative coalition under merkel assumed leadership of the
