proposed historical and religious names including eretz israel   the land of israel    zion  and judea  were considered and rejected  36  in the early weeks of independence  the government chose the term  israeli  to denote a citizen of israel  with the formal announcement made by minister of foreign affairs moshe sharett  37   the names land of israel and children of israel have historically been used to refer to the biblical kingdom of israel and the entire jewish people respectively  38  the name  israel  (standard xa0yisra u02beel  isr u0101\u02be u012bl  septuagint greek

the twelve tribes of israel or children of israel  jacob and his sons had lived in canaan but were forced by famine to go into egypt for four generations  lasting 430 years  44  until moses  a great-great grandson of jacob  45  led the israelites back into canaan during the  exodus   the earliest known archaeological artifact to mention the word  israel  as a collective is the merneptah stele of ancient egypt  dated to the late 13th century bce   46   the area is also known as the holy land  being holy for all abrahamic religions including judaism  christianity  islam and the bah xe1  xed faith  from 1920  the whole region was known as palestine  under british mandate  note 4  until the israeli declaration of independence of 1948.[47  through the centuries  the territory was known by a variety of other names  including canaan  djahy  samaria  judea  yehud  iudaea  coele-syria  syria palaestina and southern syria   the oldest evidence of early humans in the territory of modern israel  dating to 1.5 million years ago  was found in ubeidiya near the sea of galilee  48  other notable paleolithic sites include caves tabun  qesem and manot  the oldest fossils of anatomically modern humans found outside africa are the skhul and qafzeh hominids  who lived in northern israel 120,000 years ago  49  around 10th millennium bce  the natufian culture existed in the area  50   the notion of the  land of israel   known in hebrew as eretz yisrael  has been important and sacred to the jewish people since biblical times  according to the torah  god promised the land to the three patriarchs of the jewish people  51][52  on the basis of scripture  the period of the three patriarchs has been placed somewhere in the early 2nd millennium xa0bce  53  the first record of the name israel  as ysr u1ec9\ua723r  occurs in the merneptah stele  erected for egyptian pharaoh merneptah c  1209 bce   israel is laid waste and his seed is not   54  this  israel  was a cultural and probably political entity of the central highlands  well enough established to be perceived by the egyptians as a possible challenge to their hegemony  but an ethnic group rather than an organised state  55  the merneptah stele is one of four known contemporary inscriptions from antiquity containing the name of israel  the others being the tel dan stele  the mesha stele  and the kurkh monolith  56  the name appears much earlier  as a personal name  in material from ebla  57][58   modern scholars see israel arising peacefully and internally from existing people in the highlands of canaan  59  mcnutt says   it is probably safe to assume that sometime during iron age i a population began to identify itself as  israelite    differentiating itself from the canaanites through such markers as the prohibition of intermarriage  an emphasis on family history and genealogy  and religion  60  ancestors of the israelites may have included semites native to canaan and the sea peoples  61  the archaeological evidence indicates a society of village-like centres  but with more limited resources and a small population  62  villages had populations of up to 300 or 400,[63][64  which lived by farming and herding  and were largely self-sufficient  65  economic interchange was prevalent  66  writing was known and available for recording  even in small sites  67  the first kingdom of israel was established around the 11th century bce  subsequent israelite kingdoms and states ruled intermittently over the next four hundred years  and are known from various extra-biblical sources  68][69][70][71   around 930 bce  the kingdom split into a southern kingdom of judah and a northern kingdom of israel  from the middle of the 8th century bce israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding neo-assyrian empire  under tiglath-pileser iii it first split israel s territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital  samaria (722 bce   an israelite revolt (724\u2013722 bce  was crushed after the siege and capture of samaria by the assyrian king sargon ii  sargon s son  sennacherib  tried and failed to conquer judah  assyrian records say he leveled 46 walled cities and besieged jerusalem  leaving after receiving extensive tribute  72   in 586 bce  king nebuchadnezzar ii of babylon conquered judah  according to the hebrew bible  he destroyed solomon s temple and exiled the jews to babylon  the defeat was also recorded in the babylonian chronicles  73][74  in 538 bce  cyrus the great of persia conquered babylon and took over its empire  cyrus issued a proclamation granting subjugated nations  including the people of judah  religious freedom  for the original text  which corroborates the biblical narrative only in very broad terms  see the cyrus cylinder   according to the hebrew bible  50,000 judeans  led by zerubbabel  returned to judah and rebuilt the temple  a second group of 5,000  led by ezra and nehemiah  returned to judah in 456 bce although non-jews wrote to cyrus to try to prevent their return   with successive persian rule  the autonomous province yehud medinata was gradually developing back into urban society  largely dominated by judeans  the greek conquests largely skipped the region without any resistance or interest  incorporated into ptolemaic and finally seleucid empires  the southern levant was heavily hellenized  building the tensions between judeans and greeks  the conflict erupted in 167 bce with the maccabean revolt  which succeeded in establishing an independent hasmonean kingdom in judah  which later expanded over much of modern israel  as the seleucids gradually lost control in the region   the roman empire invaded the region in 63 bce  first taking control of syria  and then intervening in the hasmonean civil war  the struggle between pro-roman and pro-parthian factions in judea eventually led to the installation of herod the great and consolidation of the herodian kingdom as a vassal judean state of rome  with the decline of the herodian dynasty  judea  transformed into a roman province  became the site of a violent struggle of jews against greco-romans  culminating in the jewish u2013roman wars  ending in wide-scale destruction  expulsions  and genocide  jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled after the failure of the bar kokhba revolt against the roman empire in 132 ce  75   nevertheless  there was a continuous small jewish presence and galilee became its religious center  76][77  the mishnah and part of the talmud  central jewish texts  were composed during the 2nd to 4th centuries ce in tiberias and jerusalem  78  the region came to be populated predominantly by greco-romans on the coast and samaritans in the hill-country  christianity was gradually evolving over roman paganism  when the area stood under byzantine rule  through the 5th and 6th centuries  the dramatic events of the repeated samaritan revolts reshaped the land  with massive destruction to byzantine christian and samaritan societies and a resulting decrease of the population  after the persian conquest and the installation of a short-lived jewish commonwealth in 614 ce  the byzantine empire reconquered the country in 628   in 634\u2013641 ce  the region  including jerusalem  was conquered by the arabs who had just recently adopted islam  control of the region transferred between the rashidun caliphs  umayyads  abbasids  fatimids  seljuks  crusaders  and ayyubids throughout the next three centuries  80   during the siege of jerusalem by the first crusade in 1099  the jewish inhabitants of the city fought side by side with the fatimid garrison and the muslim population who tried in vain to defend the city against the crusaders  when the city fell  about 60,000 people were massacred  including 6,000 jews seeking refuge in a synagogue  81  at this time  a full thousand years after the fall of the jewish state  there were jewish communities all over the country  fifty of them are known and include jerusalem  tiberias  ramleh  ashkelon  caesarea  and gaza  82  according to albert of aachen  the jewish residents of haifa were the main fighting force of the city  and  mixed with saracen  fatimid  troops   they fought bravely for close to a month until forced into retreat by the crusader fleet and land army  83][84  however  joshua prawer expressed doubt over the story  noting that albert did not attend the crusades and that such a prominent role for the jews is not mentioned by any other source  85  undue weight  \u2013 discuss   in 1165  maimonides visited jerusalem and prayed on the temple mount  in the  great  holy house   87  in 1141 the spanish-jewish poet yehuda halevi issued a call for jews to migrate to the land of israel  a journey he undertook himself  in 1187 sultan saladin  founder of the ayyubid dynasty  defeated the crusaders in the battle of hattin and subsequently captured jerusalem and almost all of palestine  in time  saladin issued a proclamation inviting jews to return and settle in jerusalem  88  and according to judah al-harizi  they did   from the day the arabs took jerusalem  the israelites inhabited it   89  al-harizi compared saladin s decree allowing jews to re-establish themselves in jerusalem to the one issued by the persian king cyrus the great over 1,600 years earlier  90   in 1211  the jewish community in the country was strengthened by the arrival of a group headed by over 300 rabbis from france and england  91  among them rabbi samson ben abraham of sens  92  nachmanides  the 13th-century spanish rabbi and recognised leader of jewry greatly praised the land of israel and viewed its settlement as a positive commandment incumbent on all jews  he wrote  if the gentiles wish to make peace  we shall make peace and leave them on clear terms  but as for the land  we shall not leave it in their hands  nor in the hands of any nation  not in any generation   93   in 1260  control passed to the mamluk sultans of egypt  94  the country was located between the two centres of mamluk power  cairo and damascus  and only saw some development along the postal road connecting the two cities  jerusalem  although left without the protection of any city walls since 1219  also saw a flurry of new construction projects centred around the al-aqsa mosque compound on the temple mount  in 1266 the mamluk sultan baybars converted the cave of the patriarchs in hebron into an exclusive islamic sanctuary and banned christians and jews from entering  which previously would be able to enter it for a fee  the ban remained in place until israel took control of the building in 1967.[95][96   in 1470  isaac b  meir latif arrived from italy and counted 150 jewish families in jerusalem  97  thanks to joseph saragossi who had arrived in the closing years of the 15th century  safed and its environs had developed into the largest concentration of jews in palestine  with the help of the sephardic immigration from spain  the jewish population had increased to 10,000 by the early 16th century  98   in 1516  the region was conquered by the ottoman empire  it remained under turkish rule until the end of the first world war  when britain defeated the ottoman forces and set up a military administration across the former ottoman syria  in 1920 the territory was divided between britain and france under the mandate system  and the british-administered area which included modern day israel was named mandatory palestine  94][99][100   since the existence of the earliest jewish diaspora  many jews have aspired to return to  zion  and the  land of israel   101  though the amount of effort that should be spent towards such an aim was a matter of dispute  102][103  the hopes and yearnings of jews living in exile are an important theme of the jewish belief system  102  after the jews were expelled from spain in 1492  some communities settled in palestine  104  during the 16th century  jewish communities struck roots in the four holy cities u2014jerusalem  tiberias  hebron  and safed u2014and in 1697  rabbi yehuda hachasid led a group of 1,500 jews to jerusalem  105  in the second half of the 18th century  eastern european opponents of hasidism  known as the perushim  settled in palestine  106][107][108    therefore i believe that a wonderous generation of jews will spring into existence  the maccabaeans will rise again  let me repeat once more my opening words  the jews wish to have a state  and they shall have one  we shall live at last as free men on our own soil  and die peacefully in our own home  the world will be freed by our liberty  enriched by our wealth  magnified by our greatness  and whatever we attempt there to accomplish for our own welfare will react with beneficent force for the good of humanity    the first wave of modern jewish migration to ottoman-ruled palestine  known as the first aliyah  began in 1881  as jews fled pogroms in eastern europe  109  although the zionist movement already existed in practice  austro-hungarian journalist theodor herzl is credited with founding political zionism  110  a movement which sought to establish a jewish state in the land of israel  thus offering a solution to the so-called jewish question of the european states  in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time  111  in 1896  herzl published der judenstaat  the jewish state   offering his vision of a future jewish state  the following year he presided over the first zionist congress  112   the second aliyah (1904\u201314   began after the kishinev pogrom  some 40,000 jews settled in palestine  although nearly half of them left eventually  109  both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly orthodox jews  113  although the second aliyah included socialist groups who established the kibbutz movement  114  during world war i  british foreign secretary arthur balfour sent the balfour declaration of 1917 to baron rothschild  walter rothschild  2nd baron rothschild   a leader of the british jewish community  that stated that britain intended for the creation of a jewish  national home  within the palestinian mandate  115][116   in 1918  the jewish legion  a group primarily of zionist volunteers  assisted in the british conquest of palestine  117  arab opposition to british rule and jewish immigration led to the 1920 palestine riots and the formation of a jewish militia known as the haganah  meaning  the defense  in hebrew   from which the irgun and lehi  or the stern gang  paramilitary groups later split off  118  in 1922  the league of nations granted britain a mandate over palestine under terms which included the balfour declaration with its promise to the jews  and with similar provisions regarding the arab palestinians  119  the population of the area at this time was predominantly arab and muslim  with jews accounting for about 11%,[120  and arab christians at about 9.5  of the population  121   the third (1919\u201323  and fourth aliyahs (1924\u201329  brought an additional 100,000 jews to palestine  109  the rise of nazism and the increasing persecution of jews in 1930s europe led to the fifth aliyah  with an influx of a quarter of a million jews  this was a major cause of the arab revolt of 1936\u201339 during which the british mandate authorities alongside the zionist militias of haganah and irgun killed 5,032 arabs and wounded 14,760,[122][123  resulting in over ten percent of the adult male palestinian arab population killed  wounded  imprisoned or exiled  124  the british introduced restrictions on jewish immigration to palestine with the white paper of 1939  with countries around the world turning away jewish refugees fleeing the holocaust  a clandestine movement known as aliyah bet was organized to bring jews to palestine  109  by the end of world war ii  the jewish population of palestine had increased to 33  of the total population  125   after world war ii  britain found itself in intense conflict with the jewish community over jewish immigration limits  as well as continued conflict with the arab community over limit levels  the haganah joined irgun and lehi in an armed struggle against british rule  126  at the same time  hundreds of thousands of jewish holocaust survivors and refugees sought a new life far from their destroyed communities in europe  the yishuv attempted to bring these refugees to palestine but many were turned away or rounded up and placed in detention camps in atlit and cyprus by the british   on 22 july 1946  irgun attacked the british administrative headquarters for palestine  which was housed in the southern wing 127  of the king david hotel in jerusalem  128][129][130  a total of 91 people of various nationalities were killed and 46 were injured  131  the hotel was the site of the secretariat of the government of palestine and the headquarters of the british armed forces in palestine and transjordan  131][132  the attack initially had the approval of the haganah  it was conceived as a response to operation agatha  a series of widespread raids  including one on the jewish agency  conducted by the british authorities  and was the deadliest directed at the british during the mandate era  131][132  it was characterized as one of the  most lethal terrorist incidents of the twentieth century   133  in 1947  the british government announced it would withdraw from palestine  stating it was unable to arrive at a solution acceptable to both arabs and jews   on 15 may 1947  the general assembly of the newly formed united nations resolved that the united nations special committee on palestine be created  to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the assembly a report on the question of palestine   134  in the report of the committee dated 3 september 1947 to the general assembly  135  the majority of the committee in chapter vi proposed a plan to replace the british mandate with  an independent arab state  an independent jewish state  and the city of jerusalem     the last to be under an international trusteeship system   136  on 29 november 1947  the general assembly adopted resolution 181  ii  recommending the adoption and implementation of the plan of partition with economic union  137  the plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed by the majority of the committee in the report of 3 september  the jewish agency  which was the recognized representative of the jewish community  accepted the plan  the arab league and arab higher committee of palestine rejected it  and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition  138][139  on the following day  1 december 1947  the arab higher committee proclaimed a three-day strike  and arab gangs began attacking jewish targets  140  the jews were initially on the defensive as civil war broke out  but in early april 1948 moved onto the offensive  141][142  the arab palestinian economy collapsed and 250,000 palestinian arabs fled or were expelled  143   on 14 may 1948  the day before the expiration of the british mandate  david ben-gurion  the head of the jewish agency  declared  the establishment of a jewish state in eretz-israel  to be known as the state of israel   144][145  the only reference in the text of the declaration to the borders of the new state is the use of the term eretz-israel   land of israel    146  the following day  the armies of four arab countries u2014egypt  syria  transjordan and iraq u2014entered what had been british mandatory palestine  launching the 1948 arab u2013israeli war  147][148  contingents from yemen  morocco  saudi arabia and sudan joined the war  149][150  the apparent purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the jewish state at inception  and some arab leaders talked about driving the jews into the sea  151][152][153  according to benny morris  jews felt that the invading arab armies aimed to slaughter the jews  154  the arab league stated that the invasion was to restore law and order and to prevent further bloodshed  155   after a year of fighting  a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders  known as the green line  were established  156  jordan annexed what became known as the west bank  including east jerusalem  and egypt took control of the gaza strip  the united nations estimated that more than 700,000 palestinians were expelled by or fled from advancing israeli forces during the conflict u2014what would become known in arabic as the nakba ("catastrophe    157   israel was admitted as a member of the united nations by majority vote on 11 may 1949.[158  both israel and jordan were genuinely interested in a peace agreement but the british acted as a brake on the jordanian effort in order to avoid damaging british interests in egypt  159  in the early years of the state  the labor zionist movement led by prime minister david ben-gurion dominated israeli politics  160][161  the kibbutzim  or collective farming communities  played a pivotal role in establishing the new state  162   immigration to israel during the late 1940s and early 1950s was aided by the israeli immigration department and the non-government sponsored mossad lealiyah bet   institution for illegal immigration  163    both groups facilitated regular immigration logistics like arranging transportation  but the latter also engaged in clandestine operations in countries  particularly in the middle east and eastern europe  where the lives of jews were believed to be in danger and exit from those places was difficult  mossad lealiyah bet was disbanded in 1953.[164  the immigration was in accordance with the one million plan  the immigrants came for differing reasons  some believed in a zionist ideology or did it for the promise of a better life in israel  while others moved to escape persecution or were expelled  165][166   an influx of holocaust survivors and jews from arab and muslim countries to israel during the first three years increased the number of jews from 700,000 to 1,400,000.[167  by 1958  the population of israel rose to two million  167  between 1948 and 1970  approximately 1,150,000 jewish refugees relocated to israel  168  some new immigrants arrived as refugees with no possessions and were housed in temporary camps known as ma abarot  by 1952  over 200,000 people were living in these tent cities  169  jews of european background were often treated more favorably than jews from middle eastern and north african countries u2014housing units reserved for the latter were often re-designated for the former  with the result that jews newly arrived from arab lands generally ended up staying in transit camps for longer  170  tensions that developed between the two groups over such discrimination persist to the present day  171  during this period  food  clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the austerity period  the need to solve the crisis led ben-gurion to sign a reparations agreement with west germany that triggered mass protests by jews angered at the idea that israel could accept monetary compensation for the holocaust  172   during the 1950s  israel was frequently attacked by palestinian fedayeen  nearly always against civilians  173  mainly from the egyptian-occupied gaza strip  174  leading to several israeli counter-raids  in 1956  great britain and france aimed at regaining control of the suez canal  which the egyptians had nationalized  the continued blockade of the suez canal and straits of tiran to israeli shipping  together with the growing amount
