Intermittentenergysource
 an intermittent energy source is any source of energy or electrical power that is not continuously available due to some factor outside direct control  the intermittent source may be quite predictable  for example  tidal power  but cannot be dispatched to meet the demand of a power system  effective use of intermittent sources in an electric power grid usually relies on using the intermittent sources to displace fuel that would otherwise be consumed by non-renewable power stations  or by storing energy in the form of renewable pumped storage  compressed air or ice  or in batteries  for use when needed  or as electrode heating for district heating schemes   the capacity of a reliable renewable power supply  can be fulfilled by the use of backup or extra infrastructure and technology  using mixed renewables to produce electricity above the intermittent average  which may be utilised to meet regular and unanticipated supply demands  5  additionally  the storage of energy to fill the shortfall intermittency or for emergencies can be part of a reliable power supply   the penetration of intermittent renewables in most power grids is low  global electricity production in 2014 was supplied by 3.1  wind  and 1  solar  6  wind generates roughly 16  of electric energy in spain and portugal  7  15.3  in ireland  8  and 7  in germany  9  as of 2014 update   wind provides 39  of the electricity generated in denmark  10][11][12  to operate with this level of penetration  denmark exports surpluses and imports during shortfalls to and from neighbouring countries  particularly hydroelectric power from norway  to balance supply with demand  13  it also uses large numbers of combined heat and power  chp  stations which can rapidly adjust output  14   the use of small amounts of intermittent power has little effect on grid operations  using larger amounts of intermittent power may require upgrades or even a redesign of the grid infrastructure  15][16       several key terms are useful for understanding the issue of intermittent power sources  these terms are not standardized  and variations may be used  most of these terms also apply to traditional power plants   intermittency inherently affects solar energy  as the production of electricity from solar sources depends on the amount of sunlight at a given place and time  solar output varies throughout the day and through the seasons  and is affected by dust  cloud cover  frost or snow  many of the seasonal factors are fairly predictable  and some solar thermal systems make use of heat storage to produce grid power for a full day  21   the extent to which the intermittency of solar-generated electricity is an issue will depend on the degree to which the generation profile of solar corresponds to demand  for example  solar thermal power plants such as nevada solar one are somewhat matched to summer peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands  such as the south-western united states  thermal energy storage systems like the small spanish gemasolar thermosolar plant can improve the match between solar supply and local consumption  the improved capacity factor using thermal storage represents a decrease in maximum capacity  and extends the total time the system generates power  25][26][27   wind-generated power is a variable resource  and the amount of electricity produced at any given point in time by a given plant will depend on wind speeds  air density  and turbine characteristics  among other factors   if wind speed is too low  less than about 2.5\xa0m s  then the wind turbines will not be able to make electricity  and if it is too high  more than about 25\xa0m s  the turbines will have to be shut down to avoid damage  while the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary  as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable  28][29][30][31   according to a 2007 study of wind in the united states  ten or more widely separated wind farms connected through the grid could be relied upon for from 33 to 47  of their average output (15\u201320  of nominal capacity  as reliable  baseload power  as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height  29][30  when calculating the generating capacity available to meet summer peak demand  ercot  manages texas grid  counts wind generation at 8.7  of nameplate capacity  45   wind generates about 16   ewea \u2013 2011 european statistics  february 2012  of electric energy in spain and portugal  7  9  in ireland  7  and 7  in germany  9  wind provides around 40  of the annual electricity generated in denmark 46   up from 20  in 2005);[47][48  to meet this percentage denmark exports surpluses and imports during shortfalls to and from the eu grid  particularly norwegian hydro  to balance supply with demand  13   because wind power is generated by large numbers of small generators  individual failures do not have large impacts on power grids  this feature of wind has been referred to as resiliency  49   wind power is affected by air temperature because colder air is more dense and therefore more effective at producing wind power  as a result  wind power is affected seasonally  more output in winter than summer  and by daily temperature variations  during the 2006 california heat wave output from wind power in california significantly decreased to an average of 4  of capacity for seven days  50  a similar result was seen during the 2003 european heat wave  when the output of wind power in france  germany  and spain fell below 10  during peak demand times  51  heat waves are partially caused by large amounts of solar radiation   according to an article in energypulse   the development and expansion of well-functioning day-ahead and real time markets will provide an effective means of dealing with the variability of wind generation   52   several authors have said that no energy resource is totally reliable  amory lovins says that nuclear power plants are intermittent in that they will sometimes fail unexpectedly  often for long periods of time  53  for example  in the united states  132 nuclear plants were built  and 21  were permanently and prematurely closed due to reliability or cost problems  while another 27  have at least once completely failed for a year or more  the remaining u s  nuclear plants produce approximately 90  of their full-time full-load potential  but even they must shut down  on average  for 39 days every 17 months for scheduled refueling and maintenance  53  to cope with such intermittence by nuclear  and centralized fossil-fuelled  power plants  utilities install a  reserve margin  of roughly 15  extra capacity spinning ready for instant use  53   solid fuel nuclear plants have an additional disadvantage  for safety  they must instantly shut down in a power failure  but for nuclear-physics reasons  they can u2019t be restarted quickly  for example  during the northeast blackout of 2003  nine operating u s  nuclear units had to shut down and were later restarted  during the first three days  while they were most needed  their output was less than 3  of normal  after twelve days of restart  their average capacity loss had exceeded 50 percent  53  liquid fuel nuclear plants  particularly those with their fuel dissolved in salts  don t have the same downtime issues  their nuclear fuel goes into a drain tank when any failure inside or outside occurs  this happens passively when the freeze plug melts because of the heat created by fission  in operation the freeze plug is actively cooled   the fuel is cooled passively and slowly  so when a restart is requested the fuel salt can simply be pumped back into the reactor core as it is stil a liquid  54  if the plant was shut down longer  the fuel needs to be reheated electrically and then pumped back  the reason a solid fuel reactor can t be restarted within seconds is because of the buildup of xenon  a radioactive gas that absorbs a lot of neutrons  as it is a gas it simply comes out of solution in a liquid fuel reactor 55  and does not affect the restart process  56   the intermittency and variability of renewable energy sources can be reduced and accommodated by diversifying their technology type and geographical location  forecasting their variation  and integrating them with dispatchable renewables  such as hydropower  geothermal  and biomass   combining this with energy storage and demand response can create a power system that can reliably match real-time energy demand  the integration of ever-higher levels of renewables has already been successfully demonstrated  57   in 2009  eight american and three european authorities  writing in the leading electrical engineers  professional journal  didn t find  a credible and firm technical limit to the amount of wind energy that can be accommodated by electricity grids   in fact  not one of more than 200 international studies  nor official studies for the eastern and western u s  regions  nor the international energy agency  has found major costs or technical barriers to reliably integrating up to 30  variable renewable supplies into the grid  and in some studies much more  57   a research group at harvard university quantified the meteorologically defined limits to reduction in the variability of outputs from a coupled wind farm system in the central us   the problem with the output from a single wind farm located in any particular region is that it is variable on time scales ranging from minutes to days posing difficulties for incorporating relevant outputs into an integrated power system  the high frequency  shorter than once per day  variability of contributions from individual wind farms is determined mainly by locally generated small scale boundary layer  the low frequency variability  longer than once per day  is associated with the passage of transient waves in the atmosphere with a characteristic time scale of several days  the high frequency variability of wind-generated power can be significantly reduced by coupling outputs from 5 to 10 wind farms distributed uniformly over a ten state region of the central us  more than 95  of the remaining variability of the coupled system is concentrated at time scales longer than a day  allowing operators to take advantage of multi-day weather forecasts in scheduling projected contributions from wind  58   mark z  jacobson has studied how wind  water and solar technologies can be integrated to provide the majority of the world s energy needs  59  he advocates a  smart mix  of renewable energy sources to reliably meet electricity demand   because the wind blows during stormy conditions when the sun does not shine and the sun often shines on calm days with little wind  combining wind and solar can go a long way toward meeting demand  especially when geothermal provides a steady base and hydroelectric can be called on to fill in the gaps  60   mark a  delucchi and mark z  jacobson argue that there are at least seven ways to design and operate renewable energy systems so that they will reliably satisfy electricity demand  61   technological solutions to mitigate large-scale wind energy type intermittency exist such as increased interconnection  the european super grid   demand response  load management  diesel generators  in the british national grid  frequency response   national grid reserve service type schemes  and use of existing power stations on standby  studies by academics and grid operators indicate that the cost of compensating for intermittency is expected to be high at levels of penetration above the low levels currently in use today 62][63][64  large  distributed power grids are better able to deal with high levels of penetration than small  isolated grids  for a hypothetical european-wide power grid  analysis has shown that wind energy penetration levels as high as 70  are viable  65  and that the cost of the extra transmission lines would be only around 10  of the turbine cost  yielding power at around present day prices  66  smaller grids may be less tolerant to high levels of penetration  15][67   matching power demand to supply is not a problem specific to intermittent power sources  existing power grids already contain elements of uncertainty including sudden and large changes in demand and unforeseen power plant failures  though power grids are already designed to have some capacity in excess of projected peak demand to deal with these problems  significant upgrades may be required to accommodate large amounts of intermittent power  the international energy agency  iea  states   in the case of wind power  operational reserve is the additional generating reserve needed to ensure that differences between forecast and actual volumes of generation and demand can be met  again  it has to be noted that already significant amounts of this reserve are operating on the grid due to the general safety and quality demands of the grid  wind imposes additional demands only inasmuch as it increases variability and unpredictability  however  these factors are nothing completely new to system operators  by adding another variable  wind power changes the degree of uncertainty  but not the kind     28   using commercial technologies it is possible utilize highly variable and intermittent sources such as solar panels and wind turbines to supply 100  of a regions electrical power  for solar to provide half of all electricity and using a solar capacity factor of 20   the total capacity for solar would be 250  of the grids average daily load  for wind to provide half of all electricity and using a wind capacity factor of 30  the total capacity for wind would be 160  of the grids average daily load   a pumped storage facility would then store enough water for the grids weekly load  with a capacity for peak demand ie 200  of the grid average  this would allow for one week of overcast and windless conditions  there are unusual costs associated with building storage and total generating capacity being six times the grid average   all sources of electrical power have some degree of variability  as do demand patterns which routinely drive large swings in the amount of electricity that suppliers feed into the grid  wherever possible  grid operations procedures are designed to match supply with demand at high levels of reliability  and the tools to influence supply and demand are well-developed  the introduction of large amounts of highly variable power generation may require changes to existing procedures and additional investments   all managed grids already have existing operational and  spinning  reserve to compensate for existing uncertainties in the power grid  the addition of intermittent resources such as wind does not require 100   back-up  because operating reserves and balancing requirements are calculated on a system-wide basis  and not dedicated to a specific generating plant   at times of low or falling demand where wind output may be high or increasing  grid stability may require lowering the output of various generating sources or even increasing demand  possibly by using energy storage to time-shift output to times of higher demand  such mechanisms can include   storage of electrical energy results in some lost energy because storage and retrieval are not perfectly efficient  storage may also require substantial capital investment and space for storage facilities   the variability of production from a single wind turbine can be high  combining any additional number of turbines  for example  in a wind farm  results in lower statistical variation  as long as the correlation between the output of each turbine is imperfect  and the correlations are always imperfect due to the distance between each turbine  similarly  geographically distant wind turbines or wind farms have lower correlations  reducing overall variability  since wind power is dependent on weather systems  there is a limit to the benefit of this geographic diversity for any power system  75   multiple wind farms spread over a wide geographic area and gridded together produce power more constantly and with less variability than smaller installations  wind output can be predicted with some degree of confidence using weather forecasts  especially from large numbers of turbines farms  the ability to predict wind output is expected to increase over time as data is collected  especially from newer facilities  75   penetration refers to the proportion of a power source on a system  expressed as a percentage  20  there are several ways that this can be calculated  with the different methods yielding different penetrations  it can be calculated either as  79   the level of penetration of intermittent variable sources is significant for the following reasons   renewable electricity supply in the 20-50   penetration range has already been implemented in several european systems  albeit in the context of an integrated european grid system  57   in 2010  four german states  totaling 10 million people  relied on wind power for 43-52  of their annual electricity needs  denmark isn t far behind  supplying 22  of its power from wind in 2010 (26  in an average wind year   the extremadura region of spain is getting up to 25  of its electricity from solar  while the whole country meets 16  of its demand from wind  just during 2005-2010  portugal vaulted from 17  to 45  renewable electricity  57   there is no generally accepted maximum level of penetration  as each system s capacity to compensate for intermittency differs  and the systems themselves will change over time  discussion of acceptable or unacceptable penetration figures should be treated and used with caution  as the relevance or significance will be highly dependent on local factors  grid structure and management  and existing generation capacity   for most systems worldwide  existing penetration levels are significantly lower than practical or theoretical maximums  for example  a uk study found that  it is clear that intermittent generation need not compromise electricity system reliability at any level of penetration foreseeable in britain over the next 20 years  although it may increase costs   79   there is no generally accepted maximum penetration of wind energy that would be feasible in any given grid  rather  economic efficiency and cost considerations are more likely to dominate as critical factors  technical solutions may allow higher penetration levels to be considered in future  particularly if cost considerations are secondary   high penetration scenarios may be feasible in certain circumstances   studies have been conducted to assess the viability of specific penetration levels in specific energy markets   a series of detailed modelling studies by dr  gregor czisch  which looked at the european wide adoption of renewable energy and interlinking power grids the european super grid using hvdc cables  indicates that the entire european power usage could come from renewables  with 70  total energy from wind at the same sort of costs or lower than at present  67  this proposed large european power grid has been called a  super grid   82][83   the model deals with intermittent power issues by using base-load renewables such as hydroelectric and biomass for a substantial portion of the remaining 30  and by heavy use of hvdc to shift power from windy areas to non-windy areas  the report states that  electricity transport proves to be one of the keys to an economical electricity supply  and underscores the importance of  international co-operation in the field of renewable energy use  and  transmission   67][84][85   dr  czisch described the concept in an interview  saying  for example  if we look at wind energy in europe  we have a winter wind region where the maximum production is in winter and in the sahara region in northern africa the highest wind production is in the summer and if you combine both  you come quite close to the needs of the people living in the whole area - let s say from northern russia down to the southern part of the sahara   86   a study of the grid in ireland indicates that it would be feasible to accommodate 42   of demand  renewables in the electricity mix  87  this acceptable level of renewable penetration was found in what the study called scenario 5  provided 47  of electrical capacity  different from demand  with the following mix of renewable energies   the study cautions that various assumptions were made that  may have understated dispatch restrictions  resulting in an underestimation of operational costs  required wind curtailment  and co2 emissions  and that  the limitations of the study may overstate the technical feasibility of the portfolios analyzed      scenario 6  which proposed renewables providing 59  of electrical capacity and 54  of demand had problems  scenario 6 proposed the following mix of renewable energies   the study found that for scenario 6   a significant number of hours characterized by extreme system situations occurred where load and reserve requirements could not be met  the results of the network study indicated that for such extreme renewable penetration scenarios  a system re-design is required  rather than a reinforcement exercise   the study declined to analyze the cost effectiveness of the required changes because  determination of costs and benefits had become extremely dependent on the assumptions made  and this uncertainty would have impacted the robustness of the results  15   a study published in october 2006  by the ontario independent electric system operator  ieso  found that  there would be minimal system operation impacts for levels of wind capacity up to 5,000\xa0mw   which corresponds to a peak penetration of 17%[88   a november 2006 analysis  found that  wind power may be able to cover more than 50  of the danish electricity consumption in 2025  under conditions of high oil prices and higher costs for co2 allowances  89  denmark s two grids  covering west denmark and east denmark separately  each incorporate high-capacity interconnectors to neighbouring grids where some of the variations from wind are absorbed  90  in 2012 the danish government adopted a plan to increase the share of electricity production from wind to 50  by 2020,[91][92  and to 84  in 2035.[93   estimates of the cost of wind energy may include estimates of the  external  costs of wind variability  or be limited to the cost of production  all electrical plant has costs that are separate from the cost of production  including  for example  the cost of any necessary transmission capacity or reserve capacity in case of loss of generating capacity  many types of generation  particularly fossil fuel derived  will also have cost externalities such as pollution  greenhouse gas emission  and habitat destruction which are generally not directly accounted for  the magnitude of the economic impacts is debated and will vary by location  but is expected to rise with higher penetration levels  at low penetration levels  costs such as operating reserve and balancing costs are believed to be insignificant   intermittency may introduce additional costs that are distinct from or of a different magnitude than for traditional generation types  these may include   studies have been performed to determine the costs of variability  renewableuk states   an official at xcel energy claimed that at 20 percent penetration  additional standby generators to compensate for wind in colorado would cost $8 per mwh  adding between 13  and 16  to the us 50\u201360 cost per mwh of wind energy  97   the union of concerned scientists conducted a study of the costs to increase the renewable penetration in colorado to 10  and found that for an average residential bill  customers of municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives that opt out of the solar energy requirement  would save 4 cents per month  but that for xcel energy customers there would be additional cost of about 10 cents per month  total impact on all consumers would be $4.5 million or 0.01  over two decades  98][99   a detailed study for uk national grid  a private power company  states  we have estimated that for the case with 8,000\xa0mw of wind needed to meet the 10  renewables target for 2010  balancing costs can be expected to increase by around \xa32 per mwh of wind production  this would represent an additional \xa340million per annum  just over 10  of existing annual balancing costs   100][101   in evidence to the uk house of lords economic affairs select committee  national grid have quoted estimates of balancing costs for 40  wind and these lie in the range \xa3500-1000m per annum   these balancing costs represent an additional \xa36 to \xa312 per annum on average consumer electricity bill of around \xa3390."[102   national grid notes that  increasing levels of such renewable generation on the system would increase the costs of balancing the system and managing system frequency   101   a 2003 report  16  by carbon trust and the uk department of trade and industry  dti   projected costs of \xa31.6 to \xa32.4 billion for reinforcement and new build of transmission and distribution systems to support 10  renewable electricity in the uk by 2010  and \xa33.2bn to \xa34.5bn for 20  by 2020  the study classified  intermittency  as  not a significant issue  for the 2010 target but a  significant issue  for the 2020 target  see grid balancing  a minnesota study on wind penetration levels and found that  total integration operating cost for up to 25  wind energy  would be less than $0.0045 per kwh (additional   103   there are differing views about some sources of renewable energy and intermittency  the world nuclear association argues that the sun  wind  tides and waves cannot be controlled to provide directly either continuous base-load power  or peak-load power when it is needed  104  proponents of renewable energy use argue that the issue of intermittency of renewables is over-stated  and that practical experience demonstrates this  105  in any case  geothermal renewable energy has  like nuclear  no intermittency  but they both use the energy in radioactive materials like uranium  thorium and potassium    for many years there was a consensus within the electric utilities in the u s  that renewable electricity generators such as wind and solar are so unreliable and intermittent that they will never be able to contribute significantly to electric supply or provide baseload power  thomas petersnik  an analyst with the u s  energy information administration put it this way   by and large  renewable energy sources are too rare  too distant  too uncertain  and too ill-timed to provide significant supplies at times and places of need   106   according to a transatlantic collaborative research paper on energy return on energy invested eroei   conducted by 6 analysts and led by d  wei xdfbach  as published in the peer reviewed journal energy in 2013  the uncorrected for their intermittency  unbuffered   eroei for each energy source analyzed is as depicted in the attached table at right  107][108  while the buffered corrected for their intermittency  eroei stated in the paper for all low carbon power sources  with the exception of nuclear and biomass  were yet lower still  as when corrected for their weather intermittency  buffered   the eroei figures for intermittent energy sources as stated in the paper is diminished - a reduction of eroei dependent on how reliant they are on back up energy sources  108][109   the u s  federal energy regulatory commission  ferc  chairman jon wellinghoff has stated that  baseload capacity is going to become an anachronism  and that no new nuclear or coal plants may ever be needed in the united states  110][111  some renewable electricity sources have identical variability to coal-fired power stations  so they are base-load  and can be integrated into the electricity supply system without any additional back-up  examples include   grid operators in countries like denmark and spain now integrate large quantities of renewable energy into their electricity grids  with denmark receiving 40  of its electricity from wind power during some months  106   supporters say that the total electricity generated from a large-scale array of dispersed wind farms  located in different wind regimes  cannot be accurately described as intermittent  because it does not start up or switch off instantaneously at irregular intervals  112  with a small amount of supplementary peak-load plant  which operates infrequently  large-scale distributed wind power can substitute for some base-load power and be equally reliable  113   hydropower can be intermittent and or dispatchable  depending on the configuration of the plant  typical hydroelectric plants in the dam configuration may have substantial storage capacity  and be considered dispatchable  run of the river hydroelectric generation will typically have limited or no storage capacity  and will be variable on a seasonal or annual basis  dependent on rainfall and snow melt   28   amory lovins suggests a few basic strategies to deal with these issues   moreover  efficient energy use and energy conservation measures can reliably reduce demand for base-load and peak-load electricity  34][115   international groups are studying much higher penetrations (30-100  renewable energy   and conclusions are that these levels are also technically feasible  116  in the uk  one summary of other studies indicated that if assuming that wind power contributed less than 20  of uk power consumption  then the intermittency would cause only moderate cost  117   methods to manage wind power integration range from those that are commonly used at present  e g  demand management  to potential new technologies for grid energy storage  improved forecasting can also contribute as the daily and seasonal variations in wind and solar sources are to some extent predictable  the pembina institute and the world wide fund for nature state in the renewable is doable plan that resilience is a feature of renewable energy   these peer-reviewed papers examine the impacts of intermittency
