 the international energy agency solar heating and cooling programme  iea shc  is one of over 40 multilateral technology collaboration programmes  also known as tcps  of the international energy agency  1  it was one of the first of such programmes  founded in 1977  its current mission is to  advance international collaborative efforts for solar energy to reach the goal set in the vision of contributing 50  of the low temperature heating and cooling demand by 2030.".[2  its international solar collector statistics solar heat worldwide 3  serve as a reference document for governments  4  financial institutions  5  consulting firms 6  and non-profit organizations  7       the iea shc s members are national governments  the european commission and international organizations  each of the members is represented by one representative in the management body called the executive committee  8  the iea shc executive committee meets twice per year and is headed by an elected chairman  the iea shc currently has 26 members  australia  austria  belgium  canada  china  denmark  france  germany  italy  mexico  netherlands  norway  portugal  singapore  south africa  spain  sweden  switzerland  turkey  united kingdom  european commission  ecreee  european copper institute  gulf organization for research and development  ises  rcreee ).[9   the iea shc aims at facilitating international collaboration in the research  development and demonstration of solar thermal energy and solar buildings  their multi-year projects  also known as  tasks   are conducted by researchers from different countries  funding is provided by iea shc members  who usually pay one or more national research institutions to participate in the work   research topics include   as well as work on   the idea behind task 13 was to push construction technology towards its limits to achieve the lowest possible total purchased energy consumption  task 13 was part of the iea solar heating and cooling programme  to test the designs and techniques  and to monitor their performance   on average  the houses were designed to required 44 kwh m xb2  75  lower than the average 172 kwh m xb2 that would have been required had the houses been built to normal standards   analysis of 11 of the houses in use indicated that total savings made in practice was actually 60  [1   the 44 kwh m xb2 resulted from   in addition there was an average solar contribution designed to average 37 kwh m xb2  from a combination of passive solar gains  active solar  and photovoltaics   the buildings were constructed to be airtight  be superinsulated to roughly double normal standards  and to minimise thermal bridges  masonry and several timber framed methods were represented  along with a novel steel strengthened polystyrene block walls were used  the berlin  zero heating energy house  included a 20m xb3 (700 cubic feet  seasonal thermal store  2   the homes in the programme were   among the lessons learned were that   for a report on the task 13 findings  see energy design update  december 2003   in 2011  the iea shc executive committee announced an annual international conference on solar heating and cooling for buildings and industry  the first conference  shc 2012 took place 9\u201311 july 2012 in san francisco   23  shc 2013 on 23\u201325 september 2013 in freiburg  germany   shc 2014 on 13\u201315 october in beijing  china  shc 2015 on 2\u20134 december in istanbul  turkey  shc 2013 and shc 2015 were jointly with the european solar thermal industry federation  estif   which had previously organized their own conference  estec   apart from the reports and other publications of the research projects  tasks   the solar heating and cooling programme publishes several cross-cutting documents  the most important one being the annual collector statistics solar heat worldwide  3  the shc newsletter solar update is published twice per year  24
