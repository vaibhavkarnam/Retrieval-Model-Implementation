Utilityfrequency
 the utility frequency   power  line frequency  american english  or mains frequency  british english  is the nominal frequency of the oscillations of alternating current  ac  in an electric power grid transmitted from a power station to the end-user  in large parts of the world this is 50\xa0hz  although in the americas and parts of asia it is typically 60\xa0hz  current usage by country or region is given in the list of mains power around the world   during the development of commercial electric power systems in the late 19th and early 20th centuries  many different frequencies  and voltages  had been used  large investment in equipment at one frequency made standardization a slow process  however  as of the turn of the 21st century  places that now use the 50\xa0hz frequency tend to use 220\u2013240\xa0v  and those that now use 60\xa0hz tend to use 100\u2013127\xa0v  both frequencies coexist today  japan uses both  with no great technical reason to prefer one over the other 1  and no apparent desire for complete worldwide standardization   unless specified by the manufacturer to operate on both 50 and 60\xa0hz  appliances may not operate efficiently or even safely if used on anything other than the intended frequency   in practice  the exact frequency of the grid varies around the nominal frequency  reducing when the grid is heavily loaded  and speeding up when lightly loaded  however  most utilities will adjust the frequency of the grid over the course of the day to ensure a constant number of cycles occur  this is used by some clocks to accurately maintain their time       several factors influence the choice of frequency in an ac system  2  lighting  motors  transformers  generators and transmission lines all have characteristics which depend on the power frequency  all of these factors interact and make selection of a power frequency a matter of considerable importance  the best frequency is a compromise between contradictory requirements   in the late 19th century  designers would pick a relatively high frequency for systems featuring transformers and arc lights  so as to economize on transformer materials  but would pick a lower frequency for systems with long transmission lines or feeding primarily motor loads or rotary converters for producing direct current  when large central generating stations became practical  the choice of frequency was made based on the nature of the intended load  eventually improvements in machine design allowed a single frequency to be used both for lighting and motor loads  a unified system improved the economics of electricity production  since system load was more uniform during the course of a day   the first applications of commercial electric power were incandescent lighting and commutator-type electric motors  both devices operate well on dc  but dc could not be easily changed in voltage  and was generally only produced at the required utilization voltage   if an incandescent lamp is operated on a low-frequency current  the filament cools on each half-cycle of the alternating current  leading to perceptible change in brightness and flicker of the lamps  the effect is more pronounced with arc lamps  and the later mercury-vapor and fluorescent lamps   commutator-type motors do not operate well on high-frequency ac  because the rapid changes of current are opposed by the inductance of the motor field  though commutator-type universal motors are common in ac household appliances and power tools  they are small motors  less than 1\xa0kw  the induction motor was found to work well on frequencies around 50 to 60\xa0hz  but with the materials available in the 1890s would not work well at a frequency of  say  133\xa0hz  there is a fixed relationship between the number of magnetic poles in the induction motor field  the frequency of the alternating current  and the rotation speed  so  a given standard speed limits the choice of frequency  and the reverse   once ac electric motors became common  it was important to standardize frequency for compatibility with the customer s equipment   generators operated by slow-speed reciprocating engines will produce lower frequencies  for a given number of poles  than those operated by  for example  a high-speed steam turbine  for very slow prime mover speeds  it would be costly to build a generator with enough poles to provide a high ac frequency  as well  synchronizing two generators to the same speed was found to be easier at lower speeds  while belt drives were common as a way to increase speed of slow engines  in very large ratings  thousands of kilowatts  these were expensive  inefficient and unreliable  after about 1906  generators driven directly by steam turbines favored higher frequencies  the steadier rotation speed of high-speed machines allowed for satisfactory operation of commutators in rotary converters  2  the synchronous speed n in rpm is calculated using the formula   where f is the frequency in hertz and p is the number of poles   direct-current power was not entirely displaced by alternating current and was useful in railway and electrochemical processes  prior to the development of mercury arc valve rectifiers  rotary converters were used to produce dc power from ac  like other commutator-type machines  these worked better with lower frequencies   with ac  transformers can be used to step down high transmission voltages to lower customer utilization voltage  the transformer is effectively a voltage conversion device with no moving parts and requiring little maintenance  the use of ac eliminated the need for spinning dc voltage conversion motor-generators that require regular maintenance and monitoring   since  for a given power level  the dimensions of a transformer are roughly inversely proportional to frequency  a system with many transformers would be more economical at a higher frequency   electric power transmission over long lines favors lower frequencies  the effects of the distributed capacitance and inductance of the line are less at low frequency   generators can only be interconnected to operate in parallel if they are of the same frequency and wave-shape  by standardizing the frequency used  generators in a geographic area can be interconnected in a grid  providing reliability and cost savings   many different power frequencies were used in the 19th century  3   very early isolated ac generating schemes used arbitrary frequencies based on convenience for steam engine  water turbine and electrical generator design  frequencies between 16\u2154\xa0hz and 133\u2153\xa0hz were used on different systems  for example  the city of coventry  england  in 1895 had a unique 87\xa0hz single-phase distribution system that was in use until 1906.[4  the proliferation of frequencies grew out of the rapid development of electrical machines in the period 1880 through 1900   in the early incandescent lighting period  single-phase ac was common and typical generators were 8-pole machines operated at 2000\xa0rpm  giving a frequency of 133 hertz   though many theories exist  and quite a few entertaining urban legends  there is little certitude in the details of the history of 60\xa0hz vs  50\xa0hz   the german company aeg  descended from a company founded by edison in germany  built the first german generating facility to run at 50\xa0hz  at the time  aeg had a virtual monopoly and their standard spread to the rest of europe  after observing flicker of lamps operated by the 40\xa0hz power transmitted by the lauffen-frankfurt link in 1891  aeg raised their standard frequency to 50\xa0hz in 1891.[5   westinghouse electric decided to standardize on a higher frequency to permit operation of both electric lighting and induction motors on the same generating system  although 50\xa0hz was suitable for both  in 1890 westinghouse considered that existing arc-lighting equipment operated slightly better on 60\xa0hz  and so that frequency was chosen  5  the operation of tesla s induction motor  licensed by westinghouse in 1888  required a lower frequency than the 133\xa0hz common for lighting systems at that time  verification needed  in 1893 general electric corporation  which was affiliated with aeg in germany  built a generating project at mill creek  california using 50\xa0hz  but changed to 60\xa0hz a year later to maintain market share with the westinghouse standard   the first generators at the niagara falls project  built by westinghouse in 1895  were 25\xa0hz  because the turbine speed had already been set before alternating current power transmission had been definitively selected  westinghouse would have selected a low frequency of 30\xa0hz to drive motor loads  but the turbines for the project had already been specified at 250\xa0rpm  the machines could have been made to deliver 16\u2154\xa0hz power suitable for heavy commutator-type motors  but the westinghouse company objected that this would be undesirable for lighting and suggested 33\u2153\xa0hz  eventually a compromise of 25\xa0hz  with 12 pole 250\xa0rpm generators  was chosen  2  because the niagara project was so influential on electric power systems design  25\xa0hz prevailed as the north american standard for low-frequency ac   a general electric study concluded that 40\xa0hz would have been a good compromise between lighting  motor  and transmission needs  given the materials and equipment available in the first quarter of the 20th century  several 40\xa0hz systems were built  the lauffen-frankfurt demonstration used 40\xa0hz to transmit power 175\xa0km in 1891  a large interconnected 40\xa0hz network existed in north-east england  the newcastle-upon-tyne electric supply company  nesco  until the advent of the national grid  uk  in the late 1920s  and projects in italy used 42\xa0hz  6  the oldest continuously operating commercial hydroelectric power station in the united states  mechanicville hydroelectric plant  still produces electric power at 40\xa0hz and supplies power to the local 60\xa0hz transmission system through frequency changers  industrial plants and mines in north america and australia sometimes were built with 40\xa0hz electrical systems which were maintained until too uneconomic to continue  although frequencies near 40\xa0hz found much commercial use  these were bypassed by standardized frequencies of 25  50 and 60\xa0hz preferred by higher volume equipment manufacturers   the ganz company of hungary had standardized on 5000 alternations per minute (41\u200a2\u20443\xa0hz  for their products  so ganz clients had 41\u200a2\u20443\xa0hz systems that in some cases ran for many years  7   in the early days of electrification  so many frequencies were used that no one value prevailed  london in 1918 had 10 different frequencies   as the 20th century continued  more power was produced at 60\xa0hz  north america  or 50\xa0hz  europe and most of asia   standardization allowed international trade in electrical equipment  much later  the use of standard frequencies allowed interconnection of power grids  it wasn t until after world war ii with the advent of affordable electrical consumer goods that more uniform standards were enacted   in britain  a standard frequency of 50\xa0hz was declared as early as 1904  but significant development continued at other frequencies  8  the implementation of the national grid starting in 1926 compelled the standardization of frequencies among the many interconnected electrical service providers  the 50\xa0hz standard was completely established only after world war ii   by about 1900  european manufacturers had mostly standardized on 50\xa0hz for new installations  the german verband der elektrotechnik  vde   in the first standard for electrical machines and transformers in 1902  recommended 25\xa0hz and 50\xa0hz as standard frequencies  vde did not see much application of 25\xa0hz  and dropped it from the 1914 edition of the standard  remnant installations at other frequencies persisted until well after the second world war  7   because of the cost of conversion  some parts of the distribution system may continue to operate on original frequencies even after a new frequency is chosen  25\xa0hz power was used in ontario  quebec  the northern united states  and for railway electrification  in the 1950s  many 25\xa0hz systems  from the generators right through to household appliances  were converted and standardized  until 2009  some 25\xa0hz generators were still in existence at the sir adam beck 1  these were retrofitted to 60\xa0hz  and the rankine generating stations  until its 2009 closure  near niagara falls to provide power for large industrial customers who did not want to replace existing equipment  and some 25\xa0hz motors and a 25\xa0hz power station exist in new orleans for floodwater pumps  9  the 15\xa0kv xa0ac rail networks  used in germany  austria  switzerland  sweden and norway  still operate at 16\u2154\xa0hz or 16.7\xa0hz   in some cases  where most load was to be railway or motor loads  it was considered economic to generate power at 25\xa0hz and install rotary converters for 60\xa0hz distribution  10  converters for production of dc from alternating current were available in larger sizes and were more efficient at 25\xa0hz compared with 60\xa0hz  remnant fragments of older systems may be tied to the standard frequency system via a rotary converter or static inverter frequency changer  these allow energy to be interchanged between two power networks at different frequencies  but the systems are large  costly  and waste some energy in operation   rotating-machine frequency changers used to convert between 25\xa0hz and 60\xa0hz systems were awkward to design  a 60\xa0hz machine with 24 poles would turn at the same speed as a 25\xa0hz machine with 10 poles  making the machines large  slow-speed and expensive  a ratio of 60/30 would have simplified these designs  but the installed base at 25\xa0hz was too large to be economically opposed   in the united states  southern california edison had standardized on 50\xa0hz  11  much of southern california operated on 50\xa0hz and did not completely change frequency of their generators and customer equipment to 60\xa0hz until around 1948  some projects by the au sable electric company used 30\xa0hz at transmission voltages up to 110,000 volts in 1914.[12   initially in brazil  electric machinery were imported from europe and united states  implying the country had both 50\xa0hz and 60\xa0hz standards according to each region  in 1938  the federal government made a law  decreto-lei 852  intended to bring the whole country under 50\xa0hz within eight years  the law didn t work  and in the early 1960s it was decided that brazil would be unified under 60\xa0hz standard  because most developed and industrialized areas used 60\xa0hz  and a new law lei 4.454 was declared in 1964  brazil underwent a frequency conversion program to 60\xa0hz that was not completed until 1978.[13   in mexico  areas operating on 50\xa0hz grid were converted during the 1970s  uniting the country under 60\xa0hz  14   in japan  the western part of the country  kyoto and west  uses 60\xa0hz and the eastern part  tokyo and east  uses 50\xa0hz  this originates in the first purchases of generators from aeg in 1895  installed for tokyo  and general electric in 1896  installed in osaka  the boundary between the two regions contains four back-to-back hvdc substations which convert the frequency  these are shin shinano  sakuma dam  minami-fukumitsu  and the higashi-shimizu frequency converter   utility frequencies in use in 1897 in north america 15   utility frequencies in europe to 1900[7   even by the middle of the 20th century  utility frequencies were still not entirely standardized at the now-common 50\xa0hz or 60\xa0hz  in 1946  a reference manual for designers of radio equipment 16  listed the following now obsolete frequencies as in use  many of these regions also had 50 cycle  60 cycle or direct current supplies   frequencies in use in 1946  as well as 50\xa0hz and 60\xa0hz   where regions are marked      this is the only utility frequency shown for that region   other power frequencies are still used  germany  austria  switzerland  sweden and norway use traction power networks for railways  distributing single-phase ac at 16\u2154\xa0hz or 16.7\xa0hz  17  a frequency of 25\xa0hz is used for the austrian railway mariazeller bahn  as well as amtrak and septa s traction power systems in the united states  other ac railway systems are energized at the local commercial power frequency  50\xa0hz or 60\xa0hz   traction power may be derived from commercial power supplies by frequency converters  or in some cases may be produced by dedicated traction powerstations  in the 19th century  frequencies as low as 8\xa0hz were contemplated for operation of electric railways with commutator motors 2  some outlets in trains carry the correct voltage  but using the original train network frequency like 16\u2154\xa0hz or 16.7\xa0hz   power frequencies as high as 400\xa0hz are used in aircraft  spacecraft  submarines  server rooms for computer power  18  military equipment  and hand-held machine tools  such high frequencies cannot be economically transmitted long distances  the increased frequency greatly increases series impedance due to the inductance of transmission lines  making power transmission difficult  consequently  400\xa0hz power systems are usually confined to a building or vehicle   transformers  for example  can be made smaller because the magnetic core can be much smaller for the same power level  induction motors turn at a speed proportional to frequency  so a high frequency power supply allows more power to be obtained for the same motor volume and mass  transformers and motors for 400\xa0hz are much smaller and lighter than at 50 or 60\xa0hz  which is an advantage in aircraft and ships  a united states military standard mil-std-704 exists for aircraft use of 400\xa0hz power    regulation of power system frequency for timekeeping accuracy was not commonplace until after 1926 and laurens hammond s invention of the electric clock driven by a synchronous motor  during the 1920s  hammond gave away hundreds of such clocks to power station owners in the u s  and canada as incentive to maintain a steady 60-cycle frequency  thus rendering his inexpensive clock uniquely practical in any business or home in north america  developed in 1933  the hammond organ uses a synchronous ac clock motor to maintain perfect pitch  based on power-line frequency stability   today  ac-power network operators regulate the daily average frequency so that clocks stay within a few seconds of correct time  in practice the nominal frequency is raised or lowered by a specific percentage to maintain synchronization  over the course of a day  the average frequency is maintained at the nominal value within a few hundred parts per million  19  in the synchronous grid of continental europe  the deviation between network phase time and utc  based on international atomic time  is calculated at 08:00 each day in a control center in switzerland  the target frequency is then adjusted by up to \xb10.01\xa0hz (\xb10.02   from 50\xa0hz as needed  to ensure a long-term frequency average of exactly 50\xa0hz \xd7 60 sec \xd7 60 min \xd7 24 hours   4,320,000 cycles per day  20  in north america  whenever the error exceeds 10 seconds for the east  3 seconds for texas  or 2 seconds for the west  a correction of \xb10.02\xa0hz (0.033   is applied  time error corrections start and end either on the hour or on the half-hour  21][22   real-time frequency meters for power generation in the united kingdom are available online \u2013 an official national grid one  and an unofficial one maintained by dynamic demand  23][24  real-time frequency data of the synchronous grid of continental europe is available on websites such as mainsfrequency com and gridfrequency eu  the frequency monitoring network  fnet  at the university of tennessee measures the frequency of the interconnections within the north american power grid  as well as in several other parts of the world  these measurements are displayed on the fnet website  25   in the united states  the federal energy regulatory commission made time error correction mandatory in 2009.[26   smaller power systems may not maintain frequency with the same degree of accuracy  in 2011  the north american electric reliability corporation  nerc  discussed a proposed experiment that would relax frequency regulation requirements 27  for electrical grids which would reduce the long-term accuracy of clocks and other devices that use the 60\xa0hz grid frequency as a time base  28   the primary reason for accurate frequency control is to allow the flow of alternating current power from multiple generators through the network to be controlled  the trend in system frequency is a measure of mismatch between demand and generation  and is a necessary parameter for load control in interconnected systems   frequency of the system will vary as load and generation change  increasing the mechanical input power to a synchronous generator will not greatly affect the system frequency  but will produce more electric power from that unit  during a severe overload caused by tripping or failure of generators or transmission lines the power system frequency will decline  due to an imbalance of load versus generation  loss of an interconnection  while exporting power  relative to system total generation  will cause system frequency to rise  automatic generation control  agc  is used to maintain scheduled frequency and interchange power flows  control systems in power stations detect changes in the network-wide frequency and adjust mechanical power input to generators back to their target frequency  this counteracting usually takes a few tens of seconds due to the large rotating masses involved  temporary frequency changes are an unavoidable consequence of changing demand  exceptional or rapidly changing mains frequency is often a sign that an electricity distribution network is operating near its capacity limits  dramatic examples of which can sometimes be observed shortly before major outages  large solar farms can reduce their average output and use the spare to regulate the frequency faster as they have no rotating mass  29][30   frequency protective relays on the power system network sense the decline of frequency and automatically initiate load shedding or tripping of interconnection lines  to preserve the operation of at least part of the network  small frequency deviations  i e - 0.5\xa0hz on a 50\xa0hz or 60\xa0hz network  will result in automatic load shedding or other control actions to restore system frequency   smaller power systems  not extensively interconnected with many generators and loads  will not maintain frequency with the same degree of accuracy  where system frequency is not tightly regulated during heavy load periods  the system operators may allow system frequency to rise during periods of light load  to maintain a daily average frequency of acceptable accuracy  31][32  portable generators  not connected to a utility system  need not tightly regulate their frequency  because typical loads are insensitive to small frequency deviations   load-frequency control  lfc  is a type of integral control that restores the system frequency and power flows to adjacent areas back to their values before a change in load  the power transfer between different areas of a system is known as  net tie-line power    the general control algorithm for lfc was developed by n  cohn in 1971.[33  the algorithm involves defining the term  area control error   ace   which is the sum of the net tie-line power error and the product of the frequency error with a frequency bias constant  when the area control error is reduced to zero  the control algorithm has returned the frequency and tie-line power errors to zero  34   ac-powered appliances can give off a characteristic hum  often called  mains hum   at the multiples of the frequencies of ac power that they use  see magnetostriction   it is usually produced by motor and transformer core laminations vibrating in time with the magnetic field  this hum can also appear in audio systems  where the power supply filter or signal shielding of an amplifier is not adequate   most countries chose their television vertical synchronization rate to approximate the local mains supply frequency  this helped to prevent power line hum and magnetic interference from causing visible beat frequencies in the displayed picture of analogue receivers   another use of this side effect has resulted in its use as a forensic tool  when a recording is made that captures audio near an ac appliance or socket  the hum is also inadvertently recorded  the peaks of the hum repeat every ac cycle  every 20\xa0ms for 50\xa0hz ac  or every 16.67\xa0ms for 60\xa0hz ac   any edit of the audio that is not a multiplication of the time between the peaks will distort the regularity  introducing a phase shift  a continuous wavelet transform analysis will show discontinuities that may tell if the audio has been cut  35
