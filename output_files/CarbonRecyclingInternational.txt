CarbonRecyclingInternational
 carbon recycling international inc   cri  is an icelandic renewable methanol company  its emissions-to-liquid process uses carbon dioxide and water and electricity to create methanol fuel  2][3       cri  incorporated in 2006  was founded by fridrik jonsson  art shulenberger  oddur ingolfsson  and kc tran  4  partners include ol xeds  hs orka  grindav xedk municipality  mannvit engineering  5  and innovation center iceland  6   cri s first commercial scale plant  the george olah plant  named after george andrew olah  7  the nobel prize laureate   was completed in 2011.[8   renewable methanol is methanol derived from renewable energy  9  it can be blended into transportation fuel or processed as a chemical feedstock  rm is also a viable input for biodiesel production  fuel blends range from rm3 (3  methanol and 97  other  to rm100 (100  methanol with trace additives   high percentage blends can be used with flexible-fuel vehicles  ffvs   while low percentage blends can be used in existing cars  10  cri is interested in increasing the number of flex-fuel cars in iceland and supplying rm85.[11   alcohols  including methanol and ethanol  can be corrosive to certain materials in some vehicles  replacement parts may be necessary for higher blends  but most modern cars are capable of using low blends of methanol   production of renewable methanol is similar to that of conventional methanol  except that carbon dioxide is substituted for carbon monoxide and hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water   rm has no connection to agriculture  as water  electricity  and carbon dioxide are the primary inputs of its production process  production of rm is less vulnerable to changes in feedstock prices  12   the george olah plant  or the go plant  has a capacity of 5 million liters per year  13  it is located close to the blue lagoon and svartsengi power station  the plant is expected to use around 10  of the carbon dioxide produced by svartsengi power station  14   the european union s renewable energy directives consider rm to be a renewable fuel  making it a candidate for the eu s renewable fuel blending mandates  15   carbon dioxide is a major component of global warming  by removing carbon dioxide from industrial emissions  cri s process could help mitigate environmental impact  renewable methanol burns cleanly as a fuel  but it has trace amounts of impurities   cri s process can also be used to store energy in the form of methanol  especially in cases where the energy source is inconsistent  for example  wind and solar power are irregularly available  16][17  methanol is also a good energy carrier  being less volatile and easier to store than hydrogen   cri plans to implement standardized csps  commercial scale plants   each with a capacity of 50 million liters per year  18   cri may build a 100 ml 19  plant in h xfasav xedk  having signed a memorandum of understanding with power company landsvirkjun  20   cri has also entered into a memorandum of understanding with altona energy plc  concerning a potential project using hydrogen byproduct as a feedstock  21
