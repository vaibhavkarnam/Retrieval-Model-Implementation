Waterdesalination
 desalination is a process that extracts minerals from saline water  more generally  desalination refers to the removal of salts and minerals from a target substance  1  as in soil desalination  which is an issue for agriculture  2   saltwater is desalinated to produce water suitable for human consumption or irrigation  one by-product of desalination is salt  desalination is used on many seagoing ships and submarines  most of the modern interest in desalination is focused on cost-effective provision of fresh water for human use  along with recycled wastewater  it is one of the few rainfall-independent water sources  3   due to its energy consumption  desalinating sea water is generally more costly than fresh water from rivers or groundwater  water recycling and water conservation  however  these alternatives are not always available and depletion of reserves is a critical problem worldwide  currently  approximately 1  of the world s population is dependent on desalinated water to meet daily needs  but the un expects that 14  of the world s population will encounter water scarcity by 2025.[4   desalination is particularly relevant in dry countries such as australia  which traditionally have relied on collecting rainfall behind dams for water   according to the international desalination association  in june 2015  18,426 desalination plants operated worldwide  producing 86.8 million cubic meters per day  providing water for 300 million people  5  this number increased from 78.4 million cubic meters in 2013,[4  a 10.71  increase in 2 years  the single largest desalination project is ras al-khair in saudi arabia  which produced 1,025,000 cubic meters per day in 2014,[4  although this plant is expected to be surpassed by a plant in california  6  kuwait produces a higher proportion of its water than any other country  totaling 100  of its water use  7   the traditional process used in these operations is vacuum distillation u2014essentially boiling it to leave impurities behind  in desalination  atmospheric pressure is reduced  thus lowering the required temperature needed  liquids boil when the vapor pressure equals the ambient pressure and vapor pressure increases with temperature  thus  because of the reduced temperature  low-temperature  waste  heat from electrical power generation or industrial processes can be employed  citation needed   water is evaporated and separated from sea water through multi-stage flash distillation  which is a series of flash evaporations  8  each subsequent flash process utilizes energy released from the condensation of the water vapor from the previous step  8   multiple effect distillation  med  works through a series of steps called \u201ceffects u201d  8  incoming water is sprayed onto vertically or  more commonly  horizontally 8][9  oriented pipes which are then heated to generate steam  the steam is then used to heat the next batch of incoming sea water  8  to increase efficiency  the steam used to heat the sea water can be taken from nearby power plants  8  although this method is the most thermodynamically efficient  a few limitations exist such as a max temperature and max number of effects  9   vapor compression distillation involves using either a mechanical compressor or a jet stream to compress the vapor present above the liquid  the compressed vapor is then used to provide the heat needed for the evaporation of the rest of the sea water  8  since this system only requires power  it is more efficient if kept at a small scale  8   the principal competing process uses membranes to desalt saline water  principally applying reverse osmosis (ro   10  the ro membrane processes use semipermeable membranes and applied pressure  on the membrane feed side  to preferentially induce water permeation through the membrane while rejecting salts  reverse osmosis plant membrane systems typically use less energy than thermal desalination processes  desalination processes are driven by either thermal  e g   distillation  or electrical  e g   ro  as the primary energy types  energy cost in desalination processes varies considerably depending on water salinity  plant size and process type  at present the cost of seawater desalination  for example  is higher than traditional water sources  but it is expected that costs will continue to decrease with technology improvements that include  but are not limited to  reduction in plants footprint  improvements to plant operation and optimization  more effective feed pretreatment  and lower cost energy sources  11   freezing involves partially freezing the seawater and removing the ice to then clean and melt back down into now clean water  8  in the freezing process  water is separated from the salt in order for the water to crystallize properly  8   solar evaporation mimics the natural water cycle  in which the sun heats the sea water enough for evaporation to occur  8  after evaporation  the water vapor is condensed onto a cool surface  8   electrodialysis utilizes electric potential to move the salts through a membrane  12   energy consumption of seawater desalination has reached as low as 3 kwh m3,[13  including pre-filtering and ancillaries  similar to the energy consumption of other fresh water supplies transported over large distances  14  but much higher than local fresh water supplies that use 0.2 kwh m3 or less  15   a minimum energy consumption for seawater desalination of around 1 kwh m3 has been determined  16][17  excluding prefiltering and intake outfall pumping  under 2 kwh m3[18  has been achieved with reverse osmosis membrane technology  leaving limited scope for further energy reductions   supplying all us domestic water by desalination would increase domestic energy consumption by around 10   about the amount of energy used by domestic refrigerators  19  domestic consumption is a relatively small fraction of the total water usage  20   note   electrical equivalent  refers to the amount of electrical energy that could be generated using a given quantity of thermal energy and appropriate turbine generator  these calculations do not include the energy required to construct or refurbish items consumed in the process   cogeneration is generating excess heat and electricity generation from a single process  cogeneration can provide usable heat for desalination in an integrated  or  dual-purpose   facility where a power plant provides the energy for desalination  alternatively  the facility s energy production may be dedicated to the production of potable water  a stand-alone facility   or excess energy may be produced and incorporated into the energy grid  cogeneration takes various forms  and theoretically any form of energy production could be used  however  the majority of current and planned cogeneration desalination plants use either fossil fuels or nuclear power as their source of energy  most plants are located in the middle east or north africa  which use their petroleum resources to offset limited water resources  the advantage of dual-purpose facilities is they can be more efficient in energy consumption  thus making desalination more viable  22][23   the current trend in dual-purpose facilities is hybrid configurations  in which the permeate from reverse osmosis desalination is mixed with distillate from thermal desalination  basically  two or more desalination processes are combined along with power production  such facilities have been implemented in saudi arabia at jeddah and yanbu  24   a typical supercarrier in the us military uses nuclear power to desalinate 400,000 us gallons (1,500,000\xa0l  330,000\xa0imp xa0gal  of water per day  25   costs of desalinating sea water  infrastructure  energy  and maintenance  are generally higher than fresh water from rivers or groundwater  water recycling  and water conservation  but alternatives are not always available  desalination costs in 2013 ranged from us 0.45 to $1.00 cubic metre ($us2 to 4 kgal   (1 cubic meter is about 264 gallons   more than half of the cost comes directly from energy cost  and since energy prices are very volatile  actual costs can vary substantially  26   the cost of untreated fresh water in the developing world can reach us 5 cubic metre  27   factors that determine the costs for desalination include capacity and type of facility  location  feed water  labor  energy  financing and concentrate disposal  desalination stills control pressure  temperature and brine concentrations to optimize efficiency  nuclear-powered desalination might be economical on a large scale  28][29   while noting costs are falling  and generally positive about the technology for affluent areas in proximity to oceans  a 2004 study argued   desalinated water may be a solution for some water-stress regions  but not for places that are poor  deep in the interior of a continent  or at high elevation  unfortunately  that includes some of the places with biggest water problems    and   indeed  one needs to lift the water by 2,000\xa0m (6,600\xa0ft   or transport it over more than 1,600\xa0km (990\xa0mi  to get transport costs equal to the desalination costs  thus  it may be more economical to transport fresh water from somewhere else than to desalinate it  in places far from the sea  like new delhi  or in high places  like mexico city  transport costs could match desalination costs  desalinated water is also expensive in places that are both somewhat far from the sea and somewhat high  such as riyadh and harare  by contrast in other locations transport costs are much less  such as beijing  bangkok  zaragoza  phoenix  and  of course  coastal cities like tripoli   30  after desalination at jubail  saudi arabia  water is pumped 200\xa0mi (320\xa0km  inland to riyadh  31  for coastal cities  desalination is increasingly viewed as a competitive choice   in 2014  the israeli facilities of hadera  palmahim  ashkelon  and sorek were desalinizing water for less than us 0.40 per cubic meter  32  as of 2006  singapore was desalinating water for us 0.49 per cubic meter  33  the city of perth began operating a reverse osmosis seawater desalination plant in 2006.[34  a desalination plant now operates in sydney  35  and the wonthaggi desalination plant was under construction in wonthaggi  victoria   the perth desalination plant is powered partially by renewable energy from the emu downs wind farm  36][37  a wind farm at bungendore in new south wales was purpose-built to generate enough renewable energy to offset the sydney plant s energy use  38  mitigating concerns about harmful greenhouse gas emissions   in december 2007  the south australian government announced it would build a seawater desalination plant for the city of adelaide  australia  located at port stanvac  the desalination plant was to be funded by raising water rates to achieve full cost recovery  39][40   a january 17  2008  article in the wall street journal stated   in november  connecticut-based poseidon resources corp  won a key regulatory approval to build the $300 million water-desalination plant in carlsbad  north of san diego  the facility would produce 50,000,000 us gallons (190,000,000\xa0l  42,000,000\xa0imp xa0gal  of drinking water per day  enough to supply about 100,000 homes  41  as of june 2012  the cost for the desalinated water had risen to $2,329 per acre-foot  42  each $1,000 per acre-foot works out to $3.06 for 1,000 gallons  or $.81 per cubic meter  43   poseidon resources made an unsuccessful attempt to construct a desalination plant in tampa bay  fl  in 2001  the board of directors of tampa bay water was forced to buy the plant from poseidon in 2001 to prevent a third failure of the project  tampa bay water faced five years of engineering problems and operation at 20  capacity to protect marine life  the facility reached capacity only in 2007.[44   in 2008  a energy recovery inc  was desalinating water for $0.46 per cubic meter  45   factors that determine the costs for desalination include capacity and type of facility  location  feed water  labor  energy  financing and concentrate disposal   in the united states  cooling water intake structures are regulated by the environmental protection agency  epa   these structures can have the same impacts to the environment as desalination facility intakes  according to epa  water intake structures cause adverse environmental impact by sucking fish and shellfish or their eggs into an industrial system  there  the organisms may be killed or injured by heat  physical stress  or chemicals  larger organisms may be killed or injured when they become trapped against screens at the front of an intake structure  46  alternative intake types that mitigate these impacts include beach wells  but they require more energy and higher costs  47   the kwinana desalination plant opened in perth in 2007  water there and at queensland s gold coast desalination plant and sydney s kurnell desalination plant is withdrawn at 0.1\xa0m s (0.33\xa0ft s   which is slow enough to let fish escape  the plant provides nearly 140,000\xa0m3 (4,900,000\xa0cu xa0ft  of clean water per day  36   desalination processes produce large quantities of brine  possibly at above ambient temperature  and contain residues of pretreatment and cleaning chemicals  their reaction byproducts and heavy metals due to corrosion  48  chemical pretreatment and cleaning are a necessity in most desalination plants  which typically includes prevention of biofouling  scaling  foaming and corrosion in thermal plants  and of biofouling  suspended solids and scale deposits in membrane plants  49   to limit the environmental impact of returning the brine to the ocean  it can be diluted with another stream of water entering the ocean  such as the outfall of a wastewater treatment or power plant  with medium to large power plant and desalination plants  the power plant s cooling water flow is likely to be several times larger than that of the desalination plant  reducing the salinity of the combination  another method to dilute the brine is to mix it via a diffuser in a mixing zone  for example  once a pipeline containing the brine reaches the sea floor  it can split into many branches  each releasing brine gradually through small holes along its length  mixing can be combined with power plant or wastewater plant dilution   brine is denser than seawater and therefore sinks to the ocean bottom and can damage the ecosystem  careful reintroduction can minimize this problem  typical ocean conditions allow for rapid dilution  thereby minimizing harm   some methods of desalination  particularly in combination with evaporation ponds  solar stills  and condensation trap  solar desalination   do not discharge brine  they do not use chemicals or burn fossil fuels  they do not work with membranes or other critical parts  such as components that include heavy metals  thus do not produce toxic waste  and high maintenance    a new approach that works like a solar still  but on the scale of industrial evaporation ponds is the integrated biotectural system  50  it can be considered  full desalination  because it converts the entire amount of saltwater intake into distilled water  one of the advantages of this system is the feasibility for inland operation  standard advantages also include no air pollution and no temperature increase of endangered natural water bodies from power plant cooling-water discharge  another important advantage is the production of sea salt for industrial and other uses  as of 2015  50  of the world s sea salt production relies on fossil energy sources  51   increased water conservation and efficiency remain the most cost-effective approaches in areas with a large potential to improve the efficiency of water use practices  52  wastewater reclamation provides multiple benefits over desalination  53  urban runoff and storm water capture also provide benefits in treating  restoring and recharging groundwater  54   a proposed alternative to desalination in the american southwest is the commercial importation of bulk water from water-rich areas either by oil tankers converted to water carriers  or pipelines  the idea is politically unpopular in canada  where governments imposed trade barriers to bulk water exports as a result of a north american free trade agreement  nafta  claim  55   desalination removes iodine from water and could increase the risk of iodine deficiency disorders  israeli researchers claimed a possible link between seawater desalination and iodine deficiency  56  finding deficits among euthyroid adults exposed to iodine-poor water 57  concurrently with an increasing proportion of their area s drinking water from seawater reverse osmosis (swro   58  they later found probable iodine deficiency disorders in a population reliant on desalinated seawater  59   due to the nature of the process  there is a need to place the plants on approximately 25 acres of land on or near the shoreline  60  in the case a plant is built inland  pipes have to be laid into the ground to allow for easy intake and outtake  60  however  once the pipes are laid into the ground  they have a possibility of leaking into and contaminating nearby aquifers  60  aside from environmental risks  the noise generated by certain types of desalination plants can be loud  60   other desalination techniques include   diesel generators commonly provide electricity in remote areas  about 40%\u201350  of the energy output is low-grade heat that leaves the engine via the exhaust  connecting a membrane distillation system to the diesel engine exhaust repurposes this low-grade heat for desalination  the system actively cools the diesel generator  improving its efficiency and increasing its electricity output  this results in an energy-neutral desalination solution  an example plant was commissioned by dutch company aquaver in march 2014 for gulhi  maldives  61][62   originally stemming from ocean thermal energy conversion research  low-temperature thermal desalination  lttd  takes advantage of water boiling at low pressure  even at ambient temperature  the system uses pumps to create a low-pressure  low-temperature environment in which water boils at a temperature gradient of 8\u201310\xa0\xb0c (46\u201350\xa0\xb0f  between two volumes of water  cool ocean water is supplied from depths of up to 600\xa0m (2,000\xa0ft   this water is pumped through coils to condense the water vapor  the resulting condensate is purified water  lttd may take advantage of the temperature gradient available at power plants  where large quantities of warm wastewater are discharged from the plant  reducing the energy input needed to create a temperature gradient  63   experiments were conducted in the us and japan to test the approach  in japan  a spray- ufb02ash evaporation system was tested by saga university  64  in hawaii  the national energy laboratory tested an open-cycle otec plant with fresh water and power production using a temperature difference of 20 c xb0 between surface water and water at a depth of around 500\xa0m (1,600\xa0ft   lttd was studied by india s national institute of ocean technology  niot  in 2004  their first lttd plant opened in 2005 at kavaratti in the lakshadweep islands  the plant s capacity is 100,000\xa0l (22,000\xa0imp

experimental  floating lttd plant off the coast of chennai  with a capacity of 1,000,000\xa0l (220,000\xa0imp xa0gal  260,000\xa0us xa0gal  day  a smaller plant was established in 2009 at the north chennai thermal power station to prove the lttd application where power plant cooling water is available  63][66][67   in october 2009  saltworks technologies announced a process that uses solar or other thermal heat to drive an ionic current that removes all sodium and chlorine ions from the water using ion-exchange membranes  68   the seawater greenhouse uses natural evaporation and condensation processes inside a greenhouse powered by solar energy to grow crops in arid coastal land   adsorption-based desalination  ad  relies on the moisture absorption properties of certain materials such as silica gel  69   one process was commercialized by modern water plc using forward osmosis  with a number of plants reported to be in operation  70][71][72   the united states  france and the united arab emirates are working to develop practical solar desalination  73  aquadania s waterstillar has been installed at dahab  egypt  and in playa del carmen  mexico  in this approach  a solar thermal collector measuring two square metres can distill from 40 to 60 litres per day from any local water source \u2013 five times more than conventional stills  it eliminates the need for plastic pet bottles or energy-consuming water transport  74  in central california  a startup company waterfx is developing a solar-powered method of desalination that can enable the use of local water  including runoff water that can be treated and used again  salty groundwater in the region would be treated to become freshwater  and in areas near the ocean  seawater could be treated  75   the passarell process uses reduced atmospheric pressure rather than heat to drive evaporative desalination  the pure water vapor generated by distillation is then compressed and condensed using an advanced compressor  the compression process improves distillation efficiency by creating the reduced pressure in the evaporation chamber  the compressor centrifuges the pure water vapor after it is drawn through a demister  removing residual impurities  causing it to compress against tubes in the collection chamber  the compression of the vapor increases its temperature  the heat is transferred to the input water falling in the tubes  vaporizing the water in the tubes  water vapor condenses on the outside of the tubes as product water  by combining several physical processes  passarell enables most of the system s energy to be recycled through its evaporation  demisting  vapor compression  condensation  and water movement processes  76   geothermal energy can drive desalination  in most locations  geothermal desalination beats using scarce groundwater or surface water  environmentally and economically  citation needed   nanotube membranes of higher permeability than current generation of membranes may lead to eventual reduction in the footprint of ro desalination plants  it has also been suggested that the use of such membranes will lead to reduction in the energy needed for desalination  [77   hermetic  sulphonated nano-composite membranes have shown to be capable of removing a various contaminants to the parts per billion level  s  have little or no susceptibility to high salt concentration levels  78][79][80   biomimetic membranes are another approach  81   in 2008  siemens water technologies announced technology that applied electric fields to desalinate one cubic meter of water while using only a purported 1.5 kwh of energy  if accurate  this process would consume one-half the energy of other processes  82  as of 2012 a demonstration plant was operating in singapore  83  researchers at the university of texas at austin and the university of marburg are developing more efficient methods of electrochemically mediated seawater desalination  84   freeze-thaw desalination uses freezing to remove fresh water from frozen seawater  85   a process employing electrokinetic shocks waves can be used to accomplish membraneless desalination at ambient temperature and pressure  86  in this process  anions and cations in salt water are exchanged for carbonate anions and calcium cations  respectively using electrokinetic shockwaves  calcium and carbonate ions react to form calcium carbonate  which precipitates  leaving fresh water  the theoretical energy efficiency of this method is on par with electrodialysis and reverse osmosis   estimates vary widely between 15,000\u201320,000 desalination plants producing more than 20,000\xa0m3 day  micro desalination plants operate near almost every natural gas or fracking facility found in the united states  citation needed   evaporation of water over the oceans in the water cycle is a natural desalination process   the formation of sea ice produces ice with little salt  much lower than in seawater   seabirds distill seawater using countercurrent exchange in a gland with a rete mirabile  the gland secretes highly concentrated brine stored near the nostrils above the beak  the bird then  sneezes  the brine out  as freshwater is not usually available in their environments  some seabirds  such as pelicans  petrels  albatrosses  gulls and terns  possess this gland  which allows them to drink the salty water from their environments while they are far from land  87][88   mangrove trees grow in seawater  they secrete salt by trapping it in parts of the root  which are then eaten by animals  usually crabs   additional salt is removed by storing it in leaves that fall off  some types of mangroves have glands on their leaves  which work in a similar way to the seabird desalination gland  salt is extracted to the leaf exterior as small crystals  which then fall off the leaf   willow trees and reeds absorb salt and other contaminants  effectively desalinating the water  this is used in artificial constructed wetlands  for treating sewage  citation needed   desalination has been known to history for millennia as both a concept  and later practice  though in a limited form  the ancient greek philosopher aristotle observed in his work meteorology that \u201csalt water  when it turns into vapour  becomes sweet and the vapour does not form salt water again when it condenses  u201d and also noticed that a fine wax vessel would hold potable water after being submerged long enough in seawater  having acted as a membrane to filter the salt  there are numerous other examples of experimentation in desalination throughout antiquity and the middle ages  but desalination was never feasible on a large scale until the modern era  [89   before the industrial revolution  desalination was primarily of concern to oceangoing ships  which otherwise needed to keep on board supplies of fresh water  when protector (1779 frigate  was sold to denmark in the 1780s  as the ship hussaren  the desalination plant was studied and recorded in great detail  90  nin the newly formed united states  thomas jefferson catalogued heat-based methods going back to the 1500s  and formulated practical advice that was publicized to all u s  ships on the backs of sailing clearance permits  91][92   significant research into improved desalination methods occurred in the united states after world war ii  the office of saline water was created in the united states department of the interior by the saline water conversion act of 1952  it was merged into the office of water resources research in 1974.[93   research also took place at state universities in california  followed by development at the dow chemical company and dupont  94
