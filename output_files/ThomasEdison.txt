ThomasEdison
 thomas alva edison  february 11  1847 \u2013 october 18  1931  was an american inventor and businessman  who has been described as america s greatest inventor  2  he developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world  including the phonograph  the motion picture camera  and the long-lasting  practical electric light bulb  dubbed  the wizard of menlo park   3  he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention  and because of that  he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory  4   edison was a prolific inventor  holding 1,093 us patents in his name  as well as many patents in the united kingdom  france  and germany  more significant than the number of edison s patents was the widespread impact of his inventions  electric light and power utilities  sound recording  and motion pictures all established major new industries worldwide  edison s inventions contributed to mass communication and  in particular  telecommunications  these included a stock ticker  a mechanical vote recorder  a battery for an electric car  electrical power  recorded music and motion pictures  his advanced work in these fields was an outgrowth of his early career as a telegraph operator  edison developed a system of electric-power generation and distribution 5  to homes  businesses  and factories \u2013 a crucial development in the modern industrialized world  his first power station was on pearl street in manhattan  new york  5       thomas edison was born in milan  ohio  and grew up in port huron  michigan  he was the seventh and last child of samuel ogden edison  jr  (1804\u20131896  born in marshalltown  nova scotia  and nancy matthews elliott (1810\u20131871  born in chenango county  new york   6  his father  the son of a loyalist refugee  had moved as a boy with the family from nova scotia  settling in southwestern ontario  then called upper canada   in a village known as shewsbury  later vienna  by 1811  samuel jr  eventually fled ontario because he took part in the unsuccessful mackenzie rebellion of 1837.[7  his father  samuel sr   had earlier fought in the war of 1812 as captain of the first middlesex regiment  by contrast  samuel jr  s struggle found him on the losing side  and he crossed into the united states at sarnia-port huron  once across the border  he found his way to milan  ohio  his patrilineal family line was dutch by way of new jersey  the surname had originally been "edeson   8   his mother taught him at home  9  much of his education came from reading r g  parker s school of natural philosophy and the cooper union for the advancement of science and art  10   edison developed hearing problems at an early age  the cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections  around the middle of his career  edison attributed the hearing impairment to being struck on the ears by a train conductor when his chemical laboratory in a boxcar caught fire and he was thrown off the train in smiths creek  michigan  along with his apparatus and chemicals  in his later years  he modified the story to say the injury occurred when the conductor  in helping him onto a moving train  lifted him by the ears  11][12   edison s family moved to port huron  michigan  after the railroad bypassed milan in 1854 and business declined  13  edison sold candy and newspapers on trains running from port huron to detroit and sold vegetables to supplement his income  he briefly worked as a telegraph operator in 1863 for the grand trunk railway at stratford  ontario railway at age 16  he was held responsible for a near collision  he also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job  14][15   edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road  and  with the aid of four assistants  he set in type and printed the grand trunk herald  which he sold with his other papers  15  this began edison s long streak of entrepreneurial ventures  as he discovered his talents as a businessman  these talents eventually led him to found 14 companies  including general electric  which is still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world  16][17   edison became a telegraph operator after he saved three-year-old jimmie mackenzie from being struck by a runaway train  jimmie s father  station agent j u  mackenzie of mount clemens  michigan  was so grateful that he trained edison as a telegraph operator  edison s first telegraphy job away from port huron was at stratford junction  ontario  on the grand trunk railway  18   in 1866  at the age of 19  edison moved to louisville  kentucky  where  as an employee of western union  he worked the associated press bureau news wire  edison requested the night shift  which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes u2014reading and experimenting  eventually  the latter pre-occupation cost him his job  one night in 1867  he was working with a lead u2013acid battery when he spilled sulfuric acid onto the floor  it ran between the floorboards and onto his boss s desk below  the next morning edison was fired  19   one of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named franklin leonard pope  who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his elizabeth  new jersey  home  some of edison s earliest inventions were related to telegraphy  including a stock ticker  his first patent was for the electric vote recorder   u s  patent 90,646),[20  which was granted on june 1  1869.[21   on december 25  1871  edison married 16-year-old mary stilwell (1855\u20131884   whom he had met two months earlier  she was an employee at one of his shops  they had three children   mary edison died at age 29 on august 9  1884  of unknown causes  possibly from a brain tumor 25  or a morphine overdose  doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes  and researchers believe that some of her symptoms sounded as if they were associated with morphine poisoning  26   edison generally preferred spending time in the laboratory rather than being with his family  27   on february 24  1886  at the age of thirty-nine  edison married the 20-year-old mina miller (1865\u20131947  in akron  ohio  28  she was the daughter of the inventor lewis miller  co-founder of the chautauqua institution  and a benefactor of methodist charities  they also had three children together   mina outlived thomas edison  dying on august 24  1947.[32][33   edison began his career as an inventor in newark  new jersey  with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices  but the invention that first gained him notice was the phonograph in 1877.[34  this accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical  edison became known as  the wizard of menlo park   new jersey  3   his first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder  despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times  the phonograph made edison a celebrity  joseph henry  president of the national academy of sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the us  described edison as  the most ingenious inventor in this country    or in any other   35  in april 1878  edison travelled to washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the national academy of sciences  congressmen  senators and us president hayes  36  the washington post described edison as a  genius  and his presentation as  a scene    that will live in history   37  although edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878,[38  he did little to develop it until alexander graham bell  chichester bell  and charles tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders   edison s major innovation was the first industrial research lab  which was built in menlo park  a part of raritan township  middlesex county  new jersey  today named edison in his honor   it was built with the funds from the sale of edison s quadruplex telegraph  after his demonstration of the telegraph  edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right  so he asked western union to make a bid  he was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($211,700 in today s dollars  39    which he gratefully accepted  40  the quadruplex telegraph was edison s first big financial success  and menlo park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement  edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there  though many employees carried out research and development under his direction  his staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research  and he drove them hard to produce results   william joseph hammer  a consulting electrical engineer  started working for edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in december 1879  he assisted in experiments on the telephone  phonograph  electric railway  iron ore separator  electric lighting  and other developing inventions  however  hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device  see hammer historical collection of incandescent electric lamps   in 1880  he was appointed chief engineer of the edison lamp works  in his first year  the plant under general manager francis robbins upton turned out 50,000 lamps  according to edison  hammer was  a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting   41  frank j  sprague  a competent mathematician and former naval officer  was recruited by edward h  johnson and joined the edison organization in 1883  one of sprague s contributions to the edison laboratory at menlo park was to expand edison s mathematical methods  despite the common belief that edison did not use mathematics  analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as francis robbins upton  for example  determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of ohm s law  joule s law and economics  42   nearly all of edison s patents were utility patents  which were protected for a 17-year period and included inventions or processes that are electrical  mechanical  or chemical in nature  about a dozen were design patents  which protect an ornamental design for up to a 14-year period  as in most patents  the inventions he described were improvements over prior art  the phonograph patent  in contrast  was unprecedented as describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds  43   in just over a decade  edison s menlo park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks  edison said he wanted the lab to have  a stock of almost every conceivable material   44  a newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim  stating the lab contained  eight thousand kinds of chemicals  every kind of screw made  every size of needle  every kind of cord or wire  hair of humans  horses  hogs  cows  rabbits  goats  minx  camels xa0    silk in every texture  cocoons  various kinds of hoofs  shark s teeth  deer horns  tortoise shell xa0    cork  resin  varnish and oil  ostrich feathers  a peacock s tail  jet  amber  rubber  all ores xa0     and the list goes on  45   over his desk  edison displayed a placard with sir joshua reynolds  famous quotation   there is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking   46  this slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility   with menlo park  edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application  47  edison s name is registered on 1,093 patents  27   in 1876  edison began work to improve the microphone for telephones  at that time called a  transmitter   by developing a carbon microphone that used a button of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves  up to that point  microphones  such as the ones developed by johann philipp reis and alexander graham bell  worked by generating a weak current  edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it  48  his work was concurrent with emile berliner s loose-contact carbon transmitter  who lost a later patent case against edison over the carbon transmitters invention 49   and david edward hughes study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters  work that hughes did not bother to patent   48][50   edison used the carbon microphone concept in 1877 to create an improved telephone for western union  49  in 1886  edison found a way to improve a bell telephone microphone  one that used loose-contact ground carbon  with his discovery that it worked far better if the carbon was roasted  this type was put in use in 1890[49  and was used in all telephones along with the bell receiver until the 1980s   in 1878  edison began working on a system of electrical illumination  something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting  51  he began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp  something that would be needed for indoor use  many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps  including alessandro volta s demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by henry woodward and mathew evans  others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included humphry davy  james bowman lindsay  moses g  farmer  52  william e  sawyer  joseph swan  and heinrich g xf6bel  some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life  high expense to produce  and high electric current drawn  making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially  53]:217\u2013218 edison realized that in order to keep the thickness of the copper wire needed to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size he would have to come up with a lamp that would draw a low amount of current  this meant the lamp would have to have a high resistance and run at a relatively low voltage  around 110 volts   54   after many experiments  first with carbon filaments and then with platinum and other metals  in the end  edison returned to a carbon filament  55  the first successful test was on october 22  1879;[53]:186[56][57][27  it lasted 13.5 hours  58  edison continued to improve this design and by november 4  1879  filed for u s  patent 223,898  granted on january 27  1880  for an electric lamp using  a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires   59  this was the first commercially practical incandescent light  60   although the patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including  cotton and linen thread  wood splints  papers coiled in various ways   59  it was not until several months after the patent was granted that edison and his team discovered a carbonized bamboo filament that could last over 1,200\xa0hours  the idea of using this particular raw material originated from edison s recalling his examination of a few threads from a bamboo fishing pole while relaxing on the shore of battle lake in the present-day state of wyoming  where he and other members of a scientific team had traveled so that they could clearly observe a total eclipse of the sun on july 29  1878  from the continental divide  61   in 1878  edison formed the edison electric light company in new york city with several financiers  including j  p  morgan  spencer trask  62  and the members of the vanderbilt family  edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on december 31  1879  in menlo park  it was during this time that he said   we will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles   63   henry villard  president of the oregon railroad and navigation company  had attended edison s 1879 demonstration  villard quickly became impressed and requested edison install his electric lighting system aboard his company s new steamer  the columbia  although hesitant at first  edison relented and agreed to villard s request  following most of its completion in may 1880  the columbia was sent to new york city  where edison and his personnel installed columbia s new lighting system  due to this  the columbia became edison s first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb  the edison equipment was eventually removed from columbia in 1895.[64][65][66][67   lewis latimer joined the edison electric light company in 1884  latimer had received a patent in january 1881 for the  process of manufacturing carbons   an improved method for the production of carbon filaments for light bulbs  latimer worked as an engineer  a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation on electric lights  68   george westinghouse s company bought philip diehl s competing induction lamp patent rights (1882  for $25,000  forcing the holders of the edison patent to charge a more reasonable rate for the use of the edison patent rights and lowering the price of the electric lamp  69   on october 8  1883  the us patent office ruled that edison s patent was based on the work of william e  sawyer and was  therefore  invalid  litigation continued for nearly six years  until october 6  1889  when a judge ruled that edison s electric light improvement claim for  a filament of carbon of high resistance  was valid  70  to avoid a possible court battle with joseph swan  whose british patent had been awarded a year before edison s  he and swan formed a joint company called ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in britain   mahen theatre in brno  in what is now the czech republic   which opened in 1882  was the first public building in the world to use edison s electric lamps  with the installation supervised by edison s assistant in the invention of the lamp  francis jehl  71  in september 2010  a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in brno  in front of the theatre  72   after devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on october 21  1879  edison went on to develop an electric  utility  designed to compete with the then existent gas lighting utilities  73  on december 17  1880  he founded the edison illuminating company  and during the 1880s  he patented a system for electricity distribution  the company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on pearl street station  new york city  it was on september 4  1882  that edison switched on his pearl street generating station s electrical power distribution system  which provided 110 volts direct current  dc  to 59 customers in lower manhattan  74   earlier in the year  in january 1882  he had switched on the first steam-generating power station at holborn viaduct in london  the dc supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station  on january 19  1883  the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in roselle  new jersey   as edison was expanding his direct current  dc  power delivery system he began receiving stiff competition from companies installing alternating current  ac  systems  from the early 1880s on ac  arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the us  with the development of transformers in europe and by westinghouse electric in the us in 1885\u20131886  it became possible to transmit ac very long distances over thinner and cheaper wires  and  step down  the voltage at the destination for distribution to users  this allowed ac to be used not only in street lighting but also in lighting for small business and domestic customers  the market edison s patented low voltage dc incandescent lamp system had been designed to supply  75  edison s dc empire began suffering from one of its chief drawbacks  it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities  edison s dc plants could not deliver electricity to customers who were more than one mile from the plant and the short range left a patchwork of un-supplied customers in-between plants  small cities and rural areas could not afford an edison style system at all  this left a large part of the market without electrical service and ac companies were expanding into this gap   edison expressed views that ac was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous  as george westinghouse was installing his first ac systems in 1886  thomas edison began a pattern of striking out personally against his chief rival stating   just as certain as death  westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size  he has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically   76  many reasons have been put forward for edison s anti-ac stance  one notion is that the inventor may not have been able to grasp the more abstract theories behind ac and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand  edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from some competitor s misinstalled ac system killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general  77  on top of all that was the simple fact that edison electric had based their entire design on low voltage dc and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was  in edison s mind  out of the question  by the end of 1887  edison electric was beginning to lose market share with westinghouse  who had built 68 ac-based power stations to edison s 121 dc-based stations  to make matters worse for edison  the thomson-houston electric company of lynn  massachusetts  another ac-based competitor  had built 22 power stations  78   parallel to the expanding competition between edison and the ac companies was a rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines that turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it  79][80  edison took advantage of the public perception that ac was dangerous and teamed up with the self-styled new york anti-ac crusader harold p  brown in a propaganda campaign  aiding brown in the public electrocution of animals with ac as well as supported legislation to control and severely limit ac installations and voltages  to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system  in what was now being referred to as a  battle of currents   the development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray ac as having a greater lethal potential than dc and smear westinghouse at the same time via edison colluding with brown and westinghouse s chief ac rival  the thomson-houston electric company  to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a westinghouse ac generator   thomas edison s staunch anti-ac tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders  by the early 1890s  edison s company was generating much smaller profits than its ac rivals  and the war of currents would come to an end in 1892 with edison being forced out of controlling his own company  that year  the financier j p morgan engineered a merger of edison general electric with thomson-houston that basically put the board of thomson-houston in charge of the new company called general electric  dropping  edison  from its name   general electric now controlled three-quarters of the us electrical business and would go on to compete with westinghouse for the ac market  81][82   edison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope  a machine that uses x-rays to take radiographs  until edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by wilhelm r xf6ntgen  the technology was capable of producing only very faint images   the fundamental design of edison s fluoroscope is still in use today  although edison himself abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant  clarence dally  dally had made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and in the process been exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation  he later died of injuries related to the exposure  in 1903  a shaken edison said   don t talk to me about x-rays  i am afraid of them   83   the key to edison s fortunes was telegraphy  with knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator  he learned the basics of electricity  this allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker  the first electricity-based broadcast system  on august 9  1892  edison received a patent for a two-way telegraph   edison was also granted a patent for the motion picture camera or  kinetograph   he did the electromechanical design while his employee w  xa0k  xa0l  dickson  a photographer  worked on the photographic and optical development  much of the credit for the invention belongs to dickson  53  in 1891  thomas edison built a kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer  this device was installed in penny arcades  where people could watch short  simple films  the kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited may 20  1891.[85   in april 1896  thomas armat s vitascope  manufactured by the edison factory and marketed in edison s name  was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in new york city  later  he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings  mechanically synchronized with the film   officially the kinetoscope entered europe when the rich american businessman irving t  bush (1869\u20131948  bought from the continental commerce company of frank z  maguire and joseph d  baucus a dozen machines  bush placed from october 17  1894  the first kinetoscopes in london  at the same time  the french company kin xe9toscope edison michel et alexis werner bought these machines for the market in france  in the last three months of 1894  the continental commerce company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in europe  i e  the netherlands and italy   in germany and in austria-hungary  the kinetoscope was introduced by the deutsche- xf6sterreichische-edison-kinetoscop gesellschaft  founded by the ludwig stollwerck 86  of the schokoladen-s xfcsswarenfabrik stollwerck  amp  co of cologne   the first kinetoscopes arrived in belgium at the fairs in early 1895  the edison s kin xe9toscope fran xe7ais  a belgian company  was founded in brussels on january 15  1895  with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in monaco  france and the french colonies  the main investors in this company were belgian industrialists  87   on may 14  1895  the edison s kin xe9toscope belge was founded in brussels  the businessman ladislas-victor lewitzki  living in london but active in belgium and france  took the initiative in starting this business  he had contacts with leon gaumont and the american mutoscope and biograph co  in 1898  he also became a shareholder of the biograph and mutoscope company for france  87   edison s film studio made close to 1,200 films  the majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as fred ott s sneeze (1894   the kiss (1896   the great train robbery (1903   alice s adventures in wonderland (1910   and the first frankenstein film in 1910  in 1903  when the owners of luna park  coney island announced they would execute topsy the elephant by strangulation  poisoning  and electrocution  with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant   edison manufacturing sent a crew to film it  releasing it that same year with the title electrocuting an elephant   as the film business expanded  competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other s films  88  to better protect the copyrights on his films  edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the u s  copyright office  many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era  89   in 1908  edison started the motion picture patents company  which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios  commonly known as the edison trust   thomas edison was the first honorary fellow of the acoustical society of america  which was founded in 1929   edison said his favorite movie was the birth of a nation  he thought that talkies had  spoiled everything  for him   there isn t any good acting on the screen  they concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act  i can sense it more than you because i am deaf   90  his favorite stars were mary pickford and clara bow  91   starting in the late 1870s  thomas edison became interested and involved with mining  there was a scarcity of high-grade iron ore on the east coast of the united states and so edison instead tried to mine low-grade ore  edison would go on to develop a number of rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons  the dust would then be sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust  despite the failure of his mining company  the edison ore milling company  edison would go on to use some of the materials and equipment to begin producing cement  92   in 1901  edison visited an industrial exhibition in the sudbury area in ontario  canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment  he returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the falconbridge ore body  his attempts to mine the ore body were not successful  however  and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903.[93  a street in falconbridge  as well as the edison building  which served as the head office of falconbridge mines  are named for him     the edison storage battery company was founded in 1901  with this company edison exploited his invention of the accumulator  in 1904 already 450 people worked at the company  the first accumulators were produced for electric cars  but there were several defects  several customers were complaining about the products  when the capital of the company was spent edison paid for the company with his private money  not until 1910 edison showed a mature product  a nickel-iron-battery with lye as liquid     edison became concerned with america s reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber  he partnered with harvey firestone and henry ford  all three contributing $25,000 each  to create the edison botanic research corp  in 1927 and constructed a laboratory in fort myers  florida the following year  edison did the majority of the research and planting  sending results and sample rubber residues to his west orange lab  edison employed a two-part acid-base extraction  to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder  94  after testing 17,000 plant samples  he eventually found an adequate source in the goldenrod plant   edison moved from menlo park after the death of his first wife  mary  in 1884  and purchased a home known as  glenmont  in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife  mina  in llewellyn park in west orange  new jersey  in 1885  thomas edison had bought property in fort myers  florida  and built what was later called seminole lodge as a winter retreat  edison and mina spent many winters at their home in fort myers  and edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber  95   due to the security concerns around world war i  edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the us military  and he headed the naval consulting board in 1915.[96   edison s work on rubber took place largely at his botanic research laboratory in fort myers  which has now been designated as a national historic chemical landmark  97  the laboratory was built after thomas edison  henry ford  and harvey firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the edison botanical research corporation  initially  only ford and firestone were to contribute monetary funds to the project while edison did all the research  edison  however  wished to contribute $25,000 as well  after testing over 17,000 plant species  edison
