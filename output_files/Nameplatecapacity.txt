Nameplatecapacity
 nameplate capacity  also known as the rated capacity  nominal capacity  installed capacity  or maximum effect  is the intended full-load sustained output of a facility such as a power plant  1][2  a chemical plant  3  fuel plant  4][5][6  metal refinery  7  mine  8  and many others  nameplate capacity is the number registered with authorities for classifying the power output of a power station usually expressed in megawatts (mw   9   power plants with an output consistently near their nameplate capacity have a high capacity factor       for dispatchable power  this capacity depends on the internal technical capability of the plant to maintain output for a reasonable amount of time  for example  a day   neither momentarily nor permanently  and without considering external events such as lack of fuel or internal events such as maintenance  10  actual output can be different from nameplate capacity for a number of reasons depending on equipment and circumstances  10][11   for non-dispatchable power  particularly renewable energy  nameplate capacity refers to generation under ideal conditions  output is generally limited by weather conditions  hydroelectric dam water levels  tidal variations and other outside forces  equipment failures and maintenance usually contribute less to capacity factor reduction than the innate variation of the power source  in photovoltaics  capacity is rated under standard test conditions usually expressed in the non-si compliant unit watt-peak  wp   in addition  a pv system s nameplate capacity is sometimes denoted by a subindex  for example  mwdc or mwac  in order to clarify  whether the raw dc or already converted ac power output is referred to   the term is connected with nameplates on electrical generators as these plates describing the model name and manufacturer usually also contain the rated output  12  but the rated output of a power station to the electrical grid is invariably less than the generator nameplate capacity  because the components connecting the actual generator to the  grid  also use power  thus there is a distinction between component capacity and facility capacity
