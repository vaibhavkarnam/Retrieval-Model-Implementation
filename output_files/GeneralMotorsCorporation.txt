eventually evolved into a more modern organization whose path is shaped by individuals but not dominated entirely by any of them  world war ii was a turning point wherein military affairs  after mingling with the technologies of applied science for some 80 years  first started to become fundamentally reinvented by them  civilian life  too  changed in this direction  by the 1950s  corporations such as gm and many others were facing a new era of r amp d  different from earlier ones  less about genius inventors and individual inventions  and more about organizational progress and integrated systems  it raised new questions about where the capital for r amp d would come from in an era of limitless demand for r amp d  although not necessarily for production   alfred sloan  longtime ceo of gm (1920s to 1960s   discussed in his memoir  also considered a seminal management treatise  the relationships between government  academia  and private industry in the areas of basic science and

start-up  to develop self-driving cars that could be used in ride-sharing fleets  98][99   from the 1920s onward  general motors always maintained an internal dialog about what its economy-car and small-car policies should be  100][101  the economy and size considerations often naturally overlapped  although a strong distinction was always drawn in the 20th century between policies for the u s  market and policies for other markets  economy  in some form  always had good demand anywhere  but its definition in the u s  was long considered different from that in other markets  in this view   economy  in the u s  did not mean  small  in the sense of what qualified as  small  outside the u s  the policy discussion often focused on topics like the higher demand for truly small cars in non-u s  markets than in the u s   and whether it made more sense to import a car into a certain country or to build it domestically within that country  either as some variant of knockdown or with truly extensive domestic sourcing  100  gm s acquisitions of vauxhall motors ltd  uk  1925)[100  and adam opel ag  germany  1929),[100  rather than starting new domestic companies to compete against them  were based on analyses that convinced gm managers that acquiring an existing domestic manufacturer was a better business decision  100   although gm since the 1920s has always offered economy models in the u s  market  relative to that market s definition in any given decade   and had done research and development in the 1940s and 1950s in preparation for any potential rise of strong demand for truly small cars in the u s  market  101  it has also been criticized over the decades for not doing enough to promote fuel efficiency in the u s  market in the 1970s through 1990s  gm s response has been that it has always responded to market demands  and that most americans  despite anything they said to the contrary  did not actually demand  at purchasing-decision time  small size or fuel efficiency in their vehicles to any great or lasting extent  although some u s  consumers flocked temporarily to the ideal of fuel economy whenever fuel supply crises arose  such as 1973 and 1979   they flocked equally enthusiastically to suvs when cheap fuel of the 1980s and 1990s temporarily shielded them from any downside to these choices  citation needed   since the return of high fuel prices in the 2000s and 2010s  gm s interest in truly small-car programs for the u s  market has been renewed  as part of general motors company development  gm revived one of its idled u s  factories

industry with ethanol-burning flexible-fuel vehicles that can run on either e85  ethanol  or gasoline  the company was the first to use turbochargers and was an early proponent of v6 engines in the 1960s  but quickly lost interest as muscle car popularity increased  they demonstrated 108  gas turbine vehicles powered by kerosene  an area of interest throughout the industry  but abandoned the alternative engine configuration in view of the 1973 oil crisis  in the 1970s and 1980s  gm pushed the benefits of diesel engines and cylinder deactivation technologies with disastrous results due to poor durability in the oldsmobile diesels and drivability issues in the cadillac v8-6-4 variable-cylinder engines  in 1987  gm  in conjunction with aerovironment  built the sunraycer  which won the inaugural world solar challenge and was a showcase of advanced technology  much of the technology from sunraycer found its way into the impact prototype electric vehicle  also built by aerovironment

at any speed by ralph nader  published in 1965  is a pioneering book accusing car manufacturers of being slow to introduce safety features  and reluctant to spend money on improving safety  the subject for which the book is probably most widely known  the rear-engined gm chevrolet corvair  is covered in the first chapter  it relates to the first (1960\u20131964  models that had a swing-axle suspension design which was prone to  tuck under  in certain circumstances  in substitution for the cost-cutting lack of a front stabilizer bar  anti-roll bar   corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturer s recommended tolerances  the corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15psi front  26psi rear  when cold  18 psi and 30psi hot   and if one inflated the tires equally  as was standard practice for all other cars at the time  the result was a dangerous oversteer  158   in early march 1966  several media outlets  including the new republic and the new york times  reported that gm had tried to discredit ralph nader  hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past  and hiring prostitutes to trap him in

situations  162  the u s  department of transportation  dot  issued a press release in 1972 describing the findings of nhtsa testing from the previous year  nhtsa had conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 corvair and four contemporary cars u2014a ford falcon  plymouth valiant  volkswagen beetle  and renault dauphine u2014along with a second-generation corvair  with its completely redesigned  independent rear suspension   the 143-page report reviewed nhtsa s extreme-condition handling tests  national crash-involvement data for the cars in the test as well as general motors  internal documentation regarding the corvair s handling  163  nhtsa went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests  this review panel concluded that  the 1960\u201363 corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests       the handling and stability performance of the 1960\u201363 corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover  and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic    former gm executive john delorean asserted in his book on a clear day you can see general motors that nader s criticisms were valid  164   journalist david e  davis  in a 2009 article in automobile magazine  noted that despite nader s claim that swing-axle rear suspension were dangerous  porsche  mercedes-benz  and volkswagen all used similar swing-axle concepts during that era  165   in may 2014 the nhtsa fined the company $35 million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade  despite knowing there was a problem with the switches  thirteen deaths were attributed to the faulty switches during the time the company failed to recall the cars  the $35 million fine was the maximum the regulator could impose  [166  general motors has announced that they are also facing 79 customer lawsuits asking for as much as $10 billion for economic losses attributed to the recall  167  as well as the cobalts  the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars  such as the pontiac g5  the saturn ion  the
