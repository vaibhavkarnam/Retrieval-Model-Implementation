RenewableenergyinNorway
 norway is a heavy producer of renewable energy  first of all due to good resources in hydropower  over 99  of the electricity production in mainland norway is covered by hydropower plants  the total production of electricity from hydropower plants amounted to 135.3 twh in 2007[1  there is also a large potential in wind power  offshore wind power 2  and wave power  as well as production of bio-energy from wood  3  norway has limited resources in solar energy  but is one of the world s largest producers of solar grade silicon and silicon solar cells   the system for guarantees of origin was implemented by the eu renewable energy directive 2009/28 ec  in 2010 the average electricity consumption mix of a norwegian household was 36  renewable  4   as per the european union s 2009 renewables directive  later added in the eea agreement   norway has established a national goal for renewable energy - 67.5  of gross final consumption of energy supplied by renewable sources by 2020.[5       norway is europe s largest producer of hydropower and the 6th largest in the world  the largest producer is the norwegian government  through the state-owned statkraft which in turn  owns nine largest hydroelectric plants and is also a major player in the international energy markets  electricity is also produced by 156 other companies  hydropower generation capacity is around 31 gw in 2014  when 131 twh was produced  about 95  of total production  6  hydro production can vary 60 twh between years  depending on amount of precipitation  and the remaining undeveloped hydro potential is about 34 twh  7  by 2010 70  of the total potential had already been developed  one of the highest ratios in the world  8  dam safety reassessment began in 1995 and by 2014  26 per cent of existing installations have been rehabilitated or upgraded  generating capacity in norway is growing  between 2001 and 2014 there were 397 new projects commissioned  larger than 1 mw  upgrades to older installations larger than 10 mw represents 70  of all new capacity  9  electricity trading with wind power generated in the netherlands and denmark is driving modifications to the norwegian hydro system   in 2012 norway had a wind power electricity production of 1.6\xa0gwh  a small fraction of its total production  the following year it approved spending 20\xa0billion nok to triple its wind power capacity of ca  700\xa0mw to more than 2\xa0gw by 2020.[10  in august 2016 construction of the 1 gw fosen vind project began  increased production of power from wind turbines will allow norway to curtail its domestic consumption of hydroelectricity  which due to being dispatchable is a valuable asset in the international power market  to further curtail its consumption of hydroelectricity  norway imports electricity when excess wind production in denmark and the netherlands drives prices down there  to further develop its use of both cheap wind power and its dispatchable hydropower  norway is considering new transmission lines to allow for the same trade with scotland and germany sometime after 2020   in the transport sector the share of renewables has increased from 1.3  to 4  between 2005-2010  and currently norway has one of the highest numbers of electric cars per capita in the world  11  the government s initial goal of 50,000 electric cars on norwegian roads was reached on 20 april 2015  more than two years earlier than expected  by reaching a stock of 50,000 electric cars  the market penetration of pure electric vehicles achieved 2  of all passenger cars registered in norway  12][13  the segment s penetration passed 3  in december 2015.[14][15  with about 90,000 pure electric vehicles registered by mid-september 2016  the all-electric segment achieved a market penetration of 3.5  of all light-duty vehicles on norway s roads  16   the stock of light-duty plug-in electric vehicles registered in norway passed the 100,000 unit milestone in april 2016  making the country the fourth largest plug-in market in the world after the u s   china and japan  18][19  as of april 2016 update   the norwegian fleet of plug-in electric vehicles consist of about 81,500 all-electric passenger and light-duty vehicles  almost 17,100 plug-in hybrids  and over 2,000 all-electric commercial vans  the total stock includes almost 12,000 used imported electric cars  19   in february 2016  the government opened for public discussion until 1 july 2016 the proposed national transport plan 2018-2029  ntp   the plan explains that the transportation sector accounts for emissions of about 16.5 million tons of co2  which is about one third of the total greenhouse gas emissions produced domestically in norway  and road traffic  including both private cars and heavy vehicles  account for about 10 million tons of co2  the ntp set policies and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from private cars  trucks  ships  aircraft and construction equipment by about one half until 2030.[20][21   in order to achieve this objective  among others  the ntp sets the goal that all new cars  buses and light commercial vehicles in 2025 should be zero emission vehicles  this is  all-electric and hydrogen vehicles  by 2030  heavy-duty vans  75  of new long-distance buses  and 50  of new trucks must be zero emission vehicles  also  by 2030  40  of all ships in short sea shipping should be using biofuels or be low- or zero-emission ships  the proposed strategy states that until zero-emission vehicles take over  all internal combustion engine cars sold be plug-in hybrids  and wherever possible  biofuels must be used  also  government agencies should as far as possible make use of biofuels  low- and zero-emission technologies in private and hired vehicles and vessels  the plan also calls to support the deployment of zero emission vehicles  but also for the reduction of the existing incentives  and proposes to invest more in public transport  walking and cycling  20][21][22
