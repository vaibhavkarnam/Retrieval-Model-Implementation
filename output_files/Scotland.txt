to the south  and is otherwise surrounded by the atlantic ocean  with the north sea to the east and the north channel and irish sea to the south-west  in addition to the mainland  the country is made up of more than 790 islands  16  including the northern isles and the hebrides   the kingdom of scotland emerged as an independent sovereign state in the early middle ages and continued to exist until 1707  by inheritance in 1603  james vi  king of scots  became king of england and king of ireland  thus forming a personal union of the three kingdoms  scotland subsequently entered into a political union with the kingdom of england on 1 may 1707 to create the new kingdom of great britain  17][18   the treaty of union was agreed in 1706 and enacted by the twin acts of union 1707  passed by the parliaments of both kingdoms  despite popular opposition and anti-union riots in edinburgh  glasgow  and elsewhere   19][20  the union also created a new parliament of great britain  which succeeded both the parliament of scotland and the parliament of england   in 1801  great britain itself entered into a political union with the kingdom of ireland to create the united kingdom of great britain and ireland  the parliament of ireland merging with that of great britain to form the parliament of the united kingdom  since the creation of the irish free state in 1922  the united kingdom has comprised great britain and northern ireland   21   within scotland  the monarchy of the united kingdom has continued to use a variety of styles  titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union kingdom of scotland  the legal system within scotland has also remained separate from those of england and wales and northern ireland  scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law  22  the continued existence of legal  educational  religious and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the uk have all contributed to the continuation of scottish culture and national identity since the 1707 union with england  23   edinburgh  the country s capital and second-largest city  was the hub of the scottish enlightenment of the 18th century  which transformed scotland into one of the commercial  intellectual  and industrial powerhouses of europe  glasgow  scotland s largest city  24  was once one of the world s leading industrial cities and now lies at the centre of the greater glasgow conurbation  other major urban areas are aberdeen and dundee  scottish waters consist of a large sector of the north atlantic and the north sea  25  containing the largest oil reserves in the european union  this has given aberdeen  the third-largest city in scotland  the title of europe s oil capital  26   following a referendum in 1997  a scottish parliament was re-established  in the form of a devolved unicameral legislature comprising 129 members  having authority over many areas of domestic policy  the scottish national party   snp   which supports scottish independence  won an overall majority in the 2011 scottish parliament general election 27  and legislated for an independence referendum which was held on 18 september 2014  a majority of 55  to 45  rejected independence on an 85  voter turnout  28][29  the conservative party won an overall majority in the 2015 uk general election and legislated for a referendum on the uk s membership of the european union which was held on 23 june 2016  within scotland  a majority of 62  to 38  rejected withdrawal from the eu on a 67  voter turnout  30  scotland is represented in the uk parliament by 59 mps and in the european parliament by 6 meps  31  scotland is also a member nation of the british u2013irish council  32  and the british u2013irish parliamentary assembly        scotland  comes from scoti  the latin name for the gaels  the late latin word scotia   land of the gaels   was initially used to refer to ireland  33  by the 11th century at the latest  scotia was being used to refer to  gaelic-speaking  scotland north of the river forth  alongside albania or albany  both derived from the gaelic alba  34  the use of the words scots and scotland to encompass all of what is now scotland became common in the late middle ages  17   repeated glaciations  which covered the entire land mass of modern scotland  destroyed any traces of human habitation that may have existed before the mesolithic period  it is believed the first post-glacial groups of hunter-gatherers arrived in scotland around 12,800 years ago  as the ice sheet retreated after the last glaciation  35][36   the groups of settlers began building the first known permanent houses on scottish soil around 9,500 years ago  and the first villages around 6,000 years ago  the well-preserved village of skara brae on the mainland of orkney dates from this period  neolithic habitation  burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the northern isles and western isles  where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone  37   the 2009 discovery in scotland of a 4000-year-old tomb with burial treasures at forteviot  near perth  the capital of a pictish kingdom in the 8th and 9th centuries ad  is unrivalled anywhere in britain  it contains the remains of an early bronze age ruler laid out on white quartz pebbles and birch bark  it was also discovered for the first time that early bronze age people placed flowers in their graves  38][39   scotland may have been part of a late bronze age maritime trading culture called the atlantic bronze age  which included other celtic nations  and the areas that became england  france  spain  and portugal  40][41][42][43   in the winter of 1850  a severe storm hit scotland  causing widespread damage and over 200 deaths  44  in the bay of skaill  the storm stripped the earth from a large irregular knoll  known as  skerrabra   when the storm cleared  local villagers found the outline of a village  consisting of a number of small houses without roofs  44][45  william watt of skaill  the local laird  began an amateur excavation of the site  but after uncovering four houses  the work was abandoned in 1868.[45  the site remained undisturbed until 1913  when during a single weekend the site was plundered by a party with shovels who took away an unknown quantity of artefacts  44  in 1924  another storm swept away part of one of the houses and it was determined the site should be made secure and more seriously investigated  44  the job was given to university of edinburgh s professor vere gordon childe who travelled to skara brae for the first time in mid-1927.[44   the written protohistory of scotland began with the arrival of the roman empire in southern and central great britain  when the romans occupied what is now england and wales  administering it as a province called britannia  roman invasions and occupations of southern scotland were a series of brief interludes   according to the roman historian tacitus  the caledonians  turned to armed resistance on a large scale   attacking roman forts and skirmishing with their legions  in a surprise night-attack  the caledonians very nearly wiped out the whole 9th legion until it was saved by agricola s cavalry  46   in ad 83\u201384  the general gnaeus julius agricola defeated the caledonians at the battle of mons graupius  tacitus wrote that  before the battle  the caledonian leader  calgacus  gave a rousing speech in which he called his people the  last of the free  and accused the romans of  making the world a desert and calling it peace   freely translated   46  after the roman victory  roman forts were briefly set along the gask ridge close to the highland line  only cawdor near inverness is known to have been constructed beyond that line   three years after the battle  the roman armies had withdrawn to the southern uplands  47   the romans erected hadrian s wall to control tribes on both sides of the wall 48  so the limes britannicus became the northern border of the roman empire  although the army held the antonine wall in the central lowlands for two short periods \u2013 the last during the reign of emperor septimius severus from 208 until 210.[49   the roman military occupation of a significant part of what is now northern scotland lasted only about 40 years  although their influence on the southern section of the country  occupied by brythonic tribes such as the votadini and damnonii  would still have been considerable between the first and fifth centuries  the welsh term hen ogledd   old north   is used by scholars to describe what is now the north of england and the south of scotland during its habitation by brittonic-speaking people around ad 500 to 800.[48  according to writings from the 9th and 10th centuries  the gaelic kingdom of d xe1l riata was founded in the 6th century in western scotland  50][51  the  traditional  view is that settlers from ireland founded the kingdom  bringing gaelic language and culture with them  however  some archaeologists have argued against this view  saying there is no archaeological or placename evidence for a migration or a takeover by a small group of elites  52   the kingdom of the picts  based in fortriu by the 6th century  was the state that eventually became known as  alba  or  scotland   the development of  pictland   according to the historical model developed by peter heather  was a natural response to roman imperialism  53  another view places emphasis on the battle of dun nechtain  and the reign of bridei m  beli (671\u2013693   with another period of consolidation in the reign of \xd3engus mac fergusa (732\u2013761).[54   the kingdom of the picts as it was in the early 8th century  when bede was writing  was largely the same as the kingdom of the scots in the reign of alexander i (1107\u20131124   however  by the tenth century  the pictish kingdom was dominated by what we can recognise as gaelic culture  and had developed a traditional story of an irish conquest around the ancestor of the contemporary royal dynasty  cin xe1ed mac ailp xedn  kenneth macalpin   55][56][57   from a base of territory in eastern scotland north of the river forth and south of the river oykel  the kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the north and south  by the 12th century  the kings of alba had added to their territories the english-speaking land in the south-east and attained overlordship of gaelic-speaking galloway and norse-speaking caithness  by the end of the 13th century  the kingdom had assumed approximately its modern borders  however  processes of cultural and economic change beginning in the 12th century ensured scotland looked very different in the later middle ages   the push for this change was the reign of david i and the davidian revolution  feudalism  government reorganisation and the first legally recognised towns  called burghs  began in this period  these institutions and the immigration of french and anglo-french knights and churchmen facilitated cultural osmosis  whereby the culture and language of the low-lying and coastal parts of the kingdom s original territory in the east became  like the newly acquired south-east  english-speaking  while the rest of the country retained the gaelic language  apart from the northern isles of orkney and shetland  which remained under norse rule until 1468.[58][59][60  the scottish state entered a largely successful and stable period between the 12th and 14th centuries  there was relative peace with england  trade and educational links were well developed with the continent and at the height of this cultural flowering john duns scotus was one of europe s most important and influential philosophers   the death of alexander iii in march 1286  followed by that of his granddaughter margaret  maid of norway  broke the centuries-old succession line of scotland s kings and shattered the 200-year golden age that began with david i  edward i of england was asked to arbitrate between claimants for the scottish crown  and he organised a process known as the great cause to identify the most legitimate claimant  john balliol was pronounced king in the great hall of berwick castle on 17 november 1292 and inaugurated at scone on 30 november  st  andrew s day  edward i  who had coerced recognition as lord paramount of scotland  the feudal superior of the realm  steadily undermined john s authority  61  in 1294  balliol and other scottish lords refused edward s demands to serve in his army against the french  instead the scottish parliament sent envoys to france to negotiate an alliance  scotland and france sealed a treaty on 23 october 1295  known as the auld alliance (1295\u20131560   war ensued and king john was deposed by edward who took personal control of scotland  andrew moray and william wallace initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to english rule in what became known as the wars of scottish independence (1296\u20131328).[62   the nature of the struggle changed significantly when robert the bruce  earl of carrick  killed his rival john comyn on 10 february 1306 at greyfriars kirk in dumfries  63  he was crowned king  as robert i  less than seven weeks later  robert i battled to restore scottish independence as king for over 20 years  beginning by winning scotland back from the norman english invaders piece by piece  victory at the battle of bannockburn in 1314 proved the scots had regained control of their kingdom  in 1315  edward bruce  brother of the king  was briefly appointed high king of ireland during an ultimately unsuccessful scottish invasion of ireland aimed at strengthening scotland s position in its wars against england  in 1320 the world s first documented declaration of independence  the declaration of arbroath  won the support of pope john xxii  leading to the legal recognition of scottish sovereignty by the english crown   however  war with england continued for several decades after the death of bruce  a civil war between the bruce dynasty and their long-term comyn-balliol rivals lasted until the middle of the 14th century  although the bruce dynasty was successful  david ii s lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew robert ii to come to the throne and establish the stewart dynasty  59][64  the stewarts ruled scotland for the remainder of the middle ages  the country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the scottish renaissance to the reformation  this was despite continual warfare with england  the increasing division between highlands and lowlands  and a large number of royal minorities  64][65   this period was the height of the franco-scottish alliance  the scots guard \u2013 la garde \xc9cossaise \u2013 was founded in 1418 by charles vii of france  the scots soldiers of the garde \xc9cossaise fought alongside joan of arc against england during the hundred years war  66  in march 1421  a franco-scots force under john stewart  2nd earl of buchan  and gilbert de lafayette  defeated a larger english army at the battle of baug xe9  three years later  at the battle of verneuil  the french and scots lost around 7000 men  67  the scottish intervention contributed to france s victory in the war   in 1502  james iv of scotland signed the treaty of perpetual peace with henry vii of england  he also married henry s daughter  margaret tudor  setting the stage for the union of the crowns  for henry  the marriage into one of europe s most established monarchies gave legitimacy to the new tudor royal line  68  a decade later  james made the fateful decision to invade england in support of france under the terms of the auld alliance  he was the last british monarch to die in battle  at the battle of flodden  69  within a generation the auld alliance was ended by the treaty of edinburgh  france agreed to withdraw all land and naval forces  in the same year  1560  john knox realised his goal of seeing scotland become a protestant nation and the scottish parliament revoke papal authority in scotland  70  mary  queen of scots  a catholic and former queen of france  was forced to abdicate in 1567.[71   in 1603  james vi  king of scots inherited the thrones of the kingdom of england and the kingdom of ireland  and became king james i of england and ireland  and left edinburgh for london  72  with the exception of a short period under the protectorate  scotland remained a separate state  but there was considerable conflict between the crown and the covenanters over the form of church government  the glorious revolution of 1688\u201389 saw the overthrow of king james vii of scotland and ii of england by the english parliament in favour of william and mary   in common with countries such as france  norway  sweden and finland  scotland experienced famines during the 1690s  mortality  reduced childbirths and increased emigration reduced the population of parts of the country by between 10 and 15 per cent  73   in 1698  the company of scotland attempted project to secure a trading colony on the isthmus of panama  almost every scottish landowner who had money to spare is said to have invested in the darien scheme  its failure bankrupted these landowners  but not the burghs  nevertheless  the nobles  bankruptcy  along with the threat of an english invasion  played a leading role in convincing the scots elite to back a union with england  74][75   on 22 july 1706  the treaty of union was agreed between representatives of the scots parliament and the parliament of england and the following year twin acts of union were passed by both parliaments to create the united kingdom of great britain with effect from 1 may 1707.[18   with trade tariffs with england now abolished  trade blossomed  especially with colonial america  the clippers belonging to the glasgow tobacco lords were the fastest ships on the route to virginia  until the american war of independence in 1776  glasgow was the world s premier tobacco port  dominating world trade  76  the disparity between the wealth of the merchant classes of the scottish lowlands and the ancient clans of the scottish highlands grew  amplifying centuries of division   the deposed jacobite stuart claimants had remained popular in the highlands and north-east  particularly amongst non-presbyterians  including roman catholics and episcopalian protestants  however  two major jacobite risings launched in 1715 and 1745 failed to remove the house of hanover from the british throne  the threat of the jacobite movement to the united kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the battle of culloden  great britain s last pitched battle  this defeat paved the way for large-scale removals of the indigenous populations of the highlands and islands  known as the highland clearances   the scottish enlightenment and the industrial revolution made scotland into an intellectual  commercial and industrial powerhouse 77]\u2013so much so voltaire said  we look to scotland for all our ideas of civilisation   78  with the demise of jacobitism and the advent of the union  thousands of scots  mainly lowlanders  took up numerous positions of power in politics  civil service  the army and navy  trade  economics  colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent british empire  historian neil davidson notes  after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by scots in political life  particularly outside scotland   davidson also states  far from being  peripheral  to the british economy  scotland \u2013 or more precisely  the lowlands \u2013 lay at its core   79   the scottish reform act 1832 increased the number of scottish mps and widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes  80  from the mid-century there were increasing calls for home rule for scotland and the post of secretary of state for scotland was revived  81  towards the end of the century prime ministers of scottish descent included william e  gladstone  82  and the earl of rosebery  83  in the later 19th century the growing importance of the working classes was marked by keir hardie s success in the mid lanarkshire by-election  1888  leading to the foundation of the scottish labour party  which was absorbed into the independent labour party in 1895  with hardie as its first leader  84   glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world  and known as  the second city of the empire  after london  85  after 1860 the clydeside shipyards specialised in steamships made of iron  after 1870  made of steel   which rapidly replaced the wooden sailing vessels of both the merchant fleets and the battle fleets of the world  it became the world s pre-eminent shipbuilding centre  86  the industrial developments  while they brought work and wealth  were so rapid that housing  town-planning  and provision for public health did not keep pace with them  and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad  with overcrowding  high infant mortality  and growing rates of tuberculosis  87   while the scottish enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century  88  disproportionately large scottish contributions to british science and letters continued for another 50 years or more  thanks to such figures as the physicists james clerk maxwell and lord kelvin  and the engineers and inventors james watt and william murdoch  whose work was critical to the technological developments of the industrial revolution throughout britain  89  in literature the most successful figure of the mid-19th century was walter scott  his first prose work  waverley in 1814  is often called the first historical novel  90  it launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise scottish cultural identity  91  in the late 19th century  a number of scottish-born authors achieved international reputations  such as robert louis stevenson  arthur conan doyle  j  m  barrie and george macdonald  92  scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture  the glasgow school  which developed in the late 19th century  and flourished in the early 20th century  produced a distinctive blend of influences including the celtic revival the arts and crafts movement  and japonisme  which found favour throughout the modern art world of continental europe and helped define the art nouveau style  proponents included architect and artist charles rennie mackintosh  93   this period saw a process of rehabilitation for highland culture  in the 1820s  as part of the romantic revival  tartan and the kilt were adopted by members of the social elite  not just in scotland  but across europe  94][95  prompted by the popularity of macpherson s ossian cycle 96][97  and then walter scott s waverley novels  98  however  the highlands remained very poor and traditional  99  the desire to improve agriculture and profits led to the highland clearances  in which much of the population of the highlands suffered forced displacement as lands were enclosed  principally so that they could be used for sheep farming  the clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout britain  but were particularly notorious as a result of the late timing  the lack of legal protection for year-by-year tenants under scots law  the abruptness of the change from the traditional clan system  and the brutality of many evictions  100  one result was a continuous exodus from the land u2014to the cities  or further afield to england  canada  america or australia  101  the population of scotland grew steadily in the 19th century  from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.[102  even with the development of industry there were not enough good jobs  as a result  during the period 1841\u20131931  about 2 million scots migrated to north america and australia  and another 750,000 scots relocated to england  103   after prolonged years of struggle in the kirk  in 1834 the evangelicals gained control of the general assembly and passed the veto act  which allowed congregations to reject unwanted  intrusive  presentations to livings by patrons  the following  ten years  conflict  of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts  the result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by dr thomas chalmers  known as the great disruption of 1843  roughly a third of the clergy  mainly from the north and highlands  formed the separate free church of scotland  104  in the late 19th century growing divisions between fundamentalist calvinists and theological liberals resulted in a further split in the free church as the rigid calvinists broke away to form the free presbyterian church in 1893.[105  catholic emancipation in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of irish immigrants  particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s  mainly to the growing lowland centres like glasgow  led to a transformation in the fortunes of catholicism  in 1878  despite opposition  a roman catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country  and catholicism became a significant denomination within scotland  105   industrialisation  urbanisation and the disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools  from 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants  then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship  and in 1872 scotland moved to a system like that in england of state-sponsored largely free schools  run by local school boards  106  the historic university of glasgow became a leader in british higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes  as opposed to the upper class  107  the university of st andrews pioneered the admission of women to scottish universities  from 1892 scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century  108   scotland played a major role in the british effort in the first world war  it especially provided manpower  ships  machinery  fish and money  109  with a population of 4.8 million in 1911  scotland sent over half a million men to the war  of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease  and 150,000 were seriously wounded  110  field marshal sir douglas haig was britain s commander on the western front   the war saw the emergence of a radical movement called  red clydeside  led by militant trades unionists  formerly a liberal stronghold  the industrial districts switched to labour by 1922  with a base among the irish catholic working class districts  women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues  however  the  reds  operated within the labour party and had little influence in parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s  111   the shipbuilding industry expanded by a third and expected renewed prosperity  but instead a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 and it did not fully recover until 1939  the interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas  and high unemployment  112  indeed  the war brought with it deep social  cultural  economic  and political dislocations  thoughtful scots pondered their declension  as the main social indicators such as poor health  bad housing  and long-term mass unemployment  pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best  or even a downward spiral  service abroad on behalf of the empire lost its allure to ambitious young people  who left scotland permanently  the heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem  and no one offered workable solutions  the despair reflected what finlay (1994  describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the second world war  113   the second world war brought renewed prosperity  despite extensive bombing of cities by the luftwaffe  it saw the invention of radar by robert watson-watt  which was invaluable in the battle of britain as was the leadership at raf fighter command of air chief marshal sir hugh dowding  114   after 1945  scotland s economic situation became progressively worse due to overseas competition  inefficient industry  and industrial disputes  115  only in recent decades has the country enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance  economic factors contributing to this recovery include a resurgent financial services industry  electronics manufacturing   see silicon glen   116  and the north sea oil and gas industry  117  the introduction in 1989 by margaret thatcher s government of the community charge  widely known as the poll tax  one year before the rest of the united kingdom  contributed to a growing movement for a return to direct scottish control over domestic affairs  118  following a referendum on devolution proposals in 1997  the scotland act 1998[119  was passed by the united kingdom parliament to establish a devolved scottish parliament and scottish government with responsibility for most laws specific to scotland  120   the scottish education system has always remained distinct from the rest of the united kingdom  with a characteristic emphasis on a broad education  121  in the 15th century  the humanist emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the education act 1496  which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn  perfyct latyne   resulting in an increase in literacy among a male and wealthy elite  122  in the reformation the 1560 first book of discipline set out a plan for a school in every parish  but this proved financially impossible  123  in 1616 an act in privy council commanded every parish to establish a school  124  by the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the lowlands  but in the highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas  125  education remained a matter for the church rather than the state until the education act (1872).[126   the mainland of scotland comprises the northern third of the land mass of the island of great britain  which lies off the north-west coast of continental europe  the total area is 78,772\xa0km2 (30,414\xa0sq xa0mi   127  comparable to the size of the czech republic  scotland s only land border is with england  and runs for 96 kilometres (60\xa0mi  between the basin of the river tweed on the east coast and the solway firth in the west  the atlantic ocean borders the west coast and the north sea is to the east  the island of ireland lies only 21 kilometres (13\xa0mi  from the south-western peninsula of kintyre  128  norway is 305 kilometres (190\xa0mi  to the east and the faroes  270 kilometres (168\xa0mi  to the north   the territorial extent of scotland is generally that established by the 1237 treaty of york between scotland and the kingdom of england 129  and the 1266 treaty of perth between scotland and norway  18  important exceptions include the isle of man  which having been lost to england in the 14th century is now a crown dependency outside of the united kingdom  the island groups orkney and shetland  which were acquired from norway in 1472;[127  and berwick-upon-tweed  lost to england in 1482   the geographical centre of scotland lies a few miles from the village of newtonmore in badenoch  130  rising to 1,344 metres (4,409\xa0ft  above sea level  scotland s highest point is the summit of ben nevis  in lochaber  while scotland s longest river  the river tay  flows for a distance of 190 kilometres (118\xa0mi   131][132   the whole of scotland was covered by ice sheets during the pleistocene ice ages and the landscape is much affected by glaciation  from a geological perspective  the country has three main sub-divisions   the highlands and

guilty  and  not proven   226  both  not guilty  and  not proven  result in an acquittal  typically with no possibility of retrial in accordance with the rule of double jeopardy  there is however the possibility of a retrial where new evidence emerges at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance  where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence
