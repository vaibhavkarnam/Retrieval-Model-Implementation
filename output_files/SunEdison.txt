manufactures high purity polysilicon  monocrystalline silicon ingots  silicon wafers  solar modules  solar energy systems  and solar module racking systems  originally a silicon-wafer manufacturer established in 1959 as the monsanto electronic materials company  a former business unit of monsanto company  monsanto sold the company in 1989  prior to may 30  2013  the company was known as memc electronic materials  the name change to sunedison reflects the company s focus on solar energy  2  sunedison s corporate headquarters are in maryland heights  missouri  and the company s operational and solar headquarters are in belmont  california with offices throughout the world   established in the early stages of the semiconductor electronics industry in 1959  memc was for the next half century a major and pioneering manufacturer of silicon wafers  the most basic element of semiconductor-chip manufacturing  the company entered the solar market in a major way beginning in 2006  with longterm contracts to manufacture and sell solar wafers to several large asian solar-energy companies  contracts with other solar-energy companies followed  as did joint-venture projects on solar power plants  with the acquisition of the large  successful  and pioneering solar-energy systems company sunedison llc in late 2009 and the smaller solar-power companies axio and fotowatio in 2011  memc focused increasingly on the burgeoning solar-energy industry to offset the cyclical downturns in the semiconductor market  the company now develops  finances  and maintains solar power systems and plants for a widespread commercial  public-sector  and power-plant customer base  and its name change in 2013 to sunedison  inc  reflects its main focus  it is one of the leading solar-power companies worldwide  and with its acquisition of wind-energy company first wind in 2014  sunedison is the leading renewable energy development company in the world  3  sunedison s subsidiaries terraform power and terraform global own and operate renewable-energy projects around the globe  4  in 2015  sunedison sold off its subsidiary sunedison semiconductor  which manufactures silicon wafers for the electronics industry  the divestiture marked the completion of sunedison  inc  s transition from a semiconductor-wafer company to a dedicated renewable-energy corporation   following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent \u2013 which eventually fell through \u2013 to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company vivint solar in 2015  sunedison s stock plummeted and its more than $11\xa0billion in debt caused it to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on april 21  2016.[5][6][7       the establishment of monsanto electronic materials company  memc   a silicon wafer u2013manufacturing division to serve the emerging electronics industry  was announced on august 6  1959  as an arm of the u s -based multinational corporation monsanto  8  in february 1960 memc started production of 19mm silicon ingots at its location in st  peters  missouri  30 miles west of monsanto s headquarters in st  louis  9  as one of the first companies to produce semiconductor wafers  memc was a pioneer in the field  and some of its innovations became industry standards into the 21st century  10  memc used the czochralski process  cz process  of silicon crystal production  11  and developed the chemical mechanical polishing  cmp  process of wafer finishing  10][12][13  in 1966 memc installed its first reactors for the production of epitaxial wafers  14][15  and developed zero-dislocation crystal growing  which made large-diameter silicon crystals possible  10][16   in the early 1970s  memc opened a production plant in kuala lumpur  malaysia  and sent its st  peters u2013produced 2.25-inch ingots there for slicing and polishing  10][17  in 1979  memc became the first company to manufacture 125mm (5-inch  wafers  in 1981 the first to produce 150mm (6-inch  wafers  and  in partnership with ibm  in 1984 the first to produce 200mm (8-inch  wafers  15][18][19][20  in 1986 memc opened its production and r amp d facility in utsunomiya  japan  to serve the japanese semiconductor market  becoming the first non-japanese wafer maker with manufacturing and research facilities in japan  21][22   memc experienced heavy price-pressure from japanese competition during the mid 1980s  10  despite its success and increasing revenues  memc had to account for losses for a few years  leading to the decision of monsanto  which was refocusing on chemicals  agriculture  and biotechnology products  to sell the electronic materials division  10][23][24  in 1989 the german company h xfcls ag  the chemicals arm of the german conglomerate veba  acquired monsanto electronic materials and combined it with h xfcls  previous acquisition dynamite nobel silicon  dns  to form memc electronic materials  10][25][26][27  dns already operated silicon wafer plants in merano and novara  italy and integrated them within the new memc electronic materials  28  h xfcls supported the new subsidiary with $50\xa0million  for research and development and for manufacturing expansion  10][29  in 1991 memc developed the first process using granular polysilicon  which provided cost and productivity advantages over  chunk  polysilicon  10][30  four years later memc acquired albemarle corporation s granular polysilicon production facility in pasadena  texas  which had been producing granular polysilicon since 1987.[10][31   memc s stock began trading on the new york stock exchange with an initial public offering in 1995.[10][15  the ipo raised over $400\xa0million  which went to finance an aggressive growth plan and repay some of the debt to its parent company  and h xfcls veba retained a majority interest in the company  10][27][32   the cyclical downturn in the semiconductor business in the late 1990s hit memc hard  10][27][33  in 1998 the company reported a loss of $316\xa0million on revenues of $759\xa0million  10  in june 2000 veba ag  still holding 72  of memc  was merged with viag to form the new e on ag  10][34  e on wanted to focus on its core business of electric utilities  and assigned merrill lynch to sell memc  10][34][35  merrill was unable to find a buyer until memc announced that it was on the verge of illiquidity in the middle of 2001.[36  finally in october 2001 e on was able to agree on a deal with the private equity company texas pacific group  tpg   which purchased e on s stake in memc for a symbolic dollar and offered memc $150\xa0million in credit lines  35][36][37][38  tpg restructured memc s debt  increased its stake in the company to 90   and cut one third of its workforce  10][39][40   memc returned to profitability following the appointment of nabeel gareeb  who was ceo of memc from april 2002 to november 2008.[10][39][41][42  memc s market share rose again and by 2003 it reported positive earning figures  39][43  memc s sales topped $1\xa0billion in 2004  and it was number three in market share  10][44  through a secondary offering  tpg reduced its share of memc in 2005 to 34   and by the end of 2007  to zero  39][44   in 2006 memc announced its large-scale entry into the burgeoning solar wafer market  via longterm agreements to supply china-based suntech power and taiwan-based gintech energy with solar-grade silicon wafers  45][46][47  similar contracts followed with germany-based conergy in 2007,[39  and taiwan-based tainergy tech in 2008.[48  the company cultivated short-term solar wafer customers as well  39][49  by 2007  memc held approximately 14  of the solar wafer market  19  having returned memc to a foundation of profitability and having helped it enter the solar market  ceo nabeel gareeb resigned in november 2008.[41][50  ahmad chatila was appointed president and ceo in february 2009.[51   in july 2009 memc and q-cells  which specialized in construction and operation of photovoltaic plants  formed a joint venture to build strasskirchen solar park  a 50 mw photovoltaic plant in bavaria  germany  with memc supplying the solar wafers and q-cells converting them into solar cells  52][53  both partners invested $100\xa0million each  in return for a 50 -each ownership of the project  52  as planned  the plant was sold to an investment firm  nordcapital  after operations started at the beginning of 2010.[54   in november 2009 memc acquired the privately owned company sunedison llc  north america s largest solar energy services provider  55  founded by jigar shah  56  sunedison had been developing  financing  building  operating  and monitoring large-scale photovoltaic plants for commercial customers  including many national
