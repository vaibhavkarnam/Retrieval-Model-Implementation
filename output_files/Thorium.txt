Thorium
 thorium is a chemical element with symbol th and atomic number 90  a radioactive actinide metal  thorium is one of only two significantly radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as a primordial element  the other being uranium   a  it was discovered in 1829 by the norwegian amateur mineralogist morten thrane esmark 4  and identified by the swedish chemist j xf6ns jacob berzelius  who named it after thor  the norse god of thunder   a thorium atom has 90 protons and therefore 90 electrons  of which four are valence electrons  thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black when exposed to air  forming the dioxide  thorium is weakly radioactive  all of its known isotopes are unstable  thorium-232 (232th   which has 142 neutrons  is the most stable isotope of thorium and accounts for nearly all natural thorium  with six other natural isotopes occurring only as trace radioisotopes  thorium has the longest half-life of all the significantly radioactive elements  14.05\xa0billion xa0years  or about the age of the universe  it decays very slowly through alpha decay to radium-228 (228ra   starting a decay chain named the thorium series that ends at stable lead-208 (208pb   thorium is estimated to be about three to four times more abundant than uranium in the earth s crust  and is chiefly refined from monazite sands as a by-product of extracting rare earth metals   thorium was once commonly used as the light source in gas mantles and as an alloying material  but these applications have declined due to concerns about its radioactivity  thorium is still widely used as an alloying element in tig welding electrodes  at a rate of 1\u20132  mix with tungsten   5  it remains popular as a material in high-end optics and scientific instrumentation  thorium and uranium are the only significantly radioactive elements with major commercial applications that do not rely on their radioactivity  thorium is predicted to be able to replace uranium as nuclear fuel in nuclear reactors  but only a few thorium reactors have yet been completed       thorium is a soft  paramagnetic  bright silvery radioactive actinide metal  in the periodic table  it is located to the right of the actinide actinium  to the left of the actinide protactinium  and below the lanthanide cerium  pure thorium is very ductile and  as normal for metals  can be cold-rolled  swaged  and drawn  6  at room temperature  thorium metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure  additionally  it has two other forms at exotic conditions  one at high temperature  over 1360\xa0\xb0c  body-centred cubic  and one at high pressure  around 100\xa0gpa  body-centred tetragonal   6   the properties of thorium vary widely depending on the amount of impurities in the sample  the major impurity is usually thorium dioxide (tho2   the purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide  6  experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5\xa0and xa011.66\xa0g cm3  these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7\xa0g cm3 calculated from thorium s lattice parameters  perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast  6  these values lie intermediate between those of its neighbours actinium (10.1\xa0g cm3  and protactinium (15.4\xa0g cm3   showing the continuity of trends across the early actinides  6   thorium s melting point of 1750\xa0\xb0c is above both that of actinium (1227\xa0\xb0c  and that of protactinium  approximately 1560\xa0\xb0c   in the beginning of period 7  from francium to thorium  the melting points of the elements increase  following the trend in the other periods   this is because the number of delocalised electrons that each atom contributes increases from one in francium to four in thorium  and there is a greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one in francium to four in thorium  after thorium  there is a new smooth trend downward in the melting points of the early actinides from thorium to plutonium where the number of f electrons increases from about 0.4 to about 6  due to the itinerance of the f-orbitals  increasing hybridisation of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal resulting in increasingly complex crystal structures and weakened metallic bonding  7][8   the f-electron count for thorium is listed as a non-integer due to a 5f u20136d overlap   8  among the actinides  thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and second-lowest density  second only to actinium  its boiling point of 4788\xa0\xb0c is the fifth-highest among all the elements with known boiling points  behind only osmium  tantalum  tungsten  and rhenium  6   thorium has a bulk modulus of 54\xa0gpa  comparable to those of tin and scandium  the hardness of thorium is similar to that of soft steel  so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire  7  nevertheless  while thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium  it is harder than either of them  7  thorium becomes superconductive below 1.4\xa0k  6   thorium can also form alloys with many other metals  addition of small amounts of thorium improves the mechanical strength of magnesium  and thorium-aluminium alloys have been considered as a way to store thorium in proposed future thorium nuclear reactors  with chromium and uranium  it forms eutectic mixtures  and thorium is completely miscible in both solid and liquid states with its lighter congener cerium  6   although every element up to bismuth  element 83  has an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes   classically stable    with the exceptions of technetium and promethium  elements 43 and 61   all elements from polonium  element 84  onward are noticeably radioactive  of these  thorium  element 90  is the most stable  closely followed by uranium  element 92   the isotope 232th has a half-life of 14.05\xa0billion xa0years  about three times the age of the earth  and even slightly longer than the generally accepted age of the universe  about 13.8\xa0billion xa0years   as such  232th still occurs naturally today  four-fifths of the thorium present at earth s formation has survived to the present  9][10][11  thorium and uranium are thus the most well-studied of all the radioactive elements  12   the heaviest three primordial nuclides  232th  235u  and 238u  are the only isotopes beyond bismuth that have half-lives measured in billions of years  thus  they are the only such heavy isotopes to have survived since their production around ten billion years ago  hence  thorium and uranium are the only important primordial radioactive elements  even then  the half-life of 232th is only a billionth that of 209bi  the last classically stable nuclide  232th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in significant quantities in nature today  and thus thorium is usually considered to be a mononuclidic element  9  the reason for the existence of this  island of relative stability  at thorium and uranium  where the longest-lived isotopes have half-lives of millions or billions of years  is because the most stable isotopes of these elements have closed nuclear shells  13][14  nevertheless  since thorium and uranium have more protons than bismuth  their nuclei are thus still susceptible to alpha decay because the strong nuclear force is not strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic repulsion between their protons  15   232th is the longest-lived isotope in the 4n decay chain which includes isotopes with a mass number divisible by 4  hence the name  it is also called the thorium series after its progenitor   the chain begins with the alpha decay of 232th to 228ra  and terminates at stable 208pb  9  (232th very occasionally undergoes spontaneous fission rather than alpha decay  and has left evidence in doing so in its minerals  but the partial half-life of this process is very large at over 1021\xa0years and hence alpha decay predominates   16][17  because 232th is so long-lived  its daughters still exist in nature as radiogenic nuclides despite their much shorter half-lives  the longest among them being the 5.7-year half-life of 228ra  the immediate alpha daughter of 232th  any sample of thorium or its compounds contain traces of these daughters  which are isotopes of thallium  lead  bismuth  polonium  radon  radium  and actinium  9  as such  natural thorium samples can be chemically purified to extract its useful daughter nuclides  such as 212pb  which is used in nuclear medicine for cancer therapy  18][19   thirty radioisotopes have been characterised  which range in mass number from 209[20  to 238.[16  the most stable of them  after 232th  are 230th with a half-life of 75,380\xa0years  229th with a half-life of 7,340\xa0years  228th with a half-life of 1.92\xa0years  234th with a half-life of 24.10\xa0days  and 227th with a half-life of 18.68\xa0days  all of these isotopes occur in nature as trace radioisotopes due to their presence in the decay chains of 232th  235u  238u  and 237np  produced in minute traces in nuclear reactions in uranium ores   all of the remaining thorium isotopes have half-lives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than ten minutes  9   in deep seawaters the isotope 230th becomes significant enough that the international union of pure and applied chemistry  iupac  reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013  as it can then make up to 0.04  of natural thorium  with 232th being the remainder  21  the reason for this is that while its parent 238u is soluble in water  230th is insoluble and thus precipitates to form part of the sediment  and may be observed doing so  uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram-sized thorium samples of which over a quarter is the 230th isotope  since 230th is one of the daughters of 238u  16  thorium thus has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition  and so an atomic mass can be given  which is 232.0377(4)\xa0u  thorium is one of only three significantly radioactive elements  the others being protactinium and uranium  that occur in large enough quantities on earth for this to be possible  21   thorium also has three known nuclear isomers  or metastable states   216m1th  216m2th  and 229mth  229mth has the lowest known excitation energy of any isomer  22  measured to be (7.6\xa0\xb1\xa00.5)\xa0ev  this is so low that when it undergoes isomeric transition  the emitted gamma radiation is in the ultraviolet range  23][24][25  b   in the early history of the study of radioactivity  the different natural isotopes of thorium were given different names  in this scheme  227th was named radioactinium  rdac   228th radiothorium  rdth   230th ionium  io   231th uranium y  uy   232th thorium  th   and 234th uranium x1 (ux1).[16  this reflects that 227th and 231th occur in the decay chain of natural 235u  the actinium series   228th occurs in the decay chain of 232th  the thorium series   and that 230th occurs in the decay chain of 238u  the uranium or radium series   the remaining natural thorium isotope  229th  occurs in minute traces as part of the decay chain of 237np  the neptunium series  which is much less abundant than the other decay chains in nature and was hence discovered much later  therefore it does not have a historical name  when it was realised that all of these are isotopes of thorium  many of these names fell out of use  and  thorium  came to refer to all isotopes  not just 232th  16  the name ionium is still encountered for 230th in the context of ionium-thorium dating  27][28   different isotopes of thorium behave identically chemically  but have slightly differing physical properties  for example  the densities of isotopically pure 228th  229th  230th  and 232th in g cm3 are respectively expected to be 11.5  11.6  11.6  and 11.7.[29  the isotope 229th is expected to be fissionable with a bare critical mass of 2839\xa0kg  although with steel reflectors this value could drop to 994\xa0kg  29  c  while 232th is not fissionable  it is fertile as it can be converted to fissile 233u using neutron capture  29][30   two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes  uranium-thorium dating  involving the decay of 234u to 230th  ionium   and ionium-thorium dating  which measures the ratio of 232th to 230th  these rely on the fact that 232th is a primordial radioisotope  but 230th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of 238u  31  uranium-thorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of 234u and 230th relative to the age of the earth  it is also accompanied by a sister process involving the alpha decay of 235u into 231th  which very quickly becomes the longer-lived 231pa  and this process is often used to check the results of uranium-thorium dating  uranium-thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of calcium carbonate materials such as speleothem or coral  because while uranium is rather soluble in water  thorium and protactinium are not  and so they are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor sediments  from which their ratios are measured  the scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years  31][32  ionium-thorium dating is a related process  which exploits the insolubility of thorium  both 232th and 230th  and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of 232th to 230th  27][28  both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of 230th to 232th is a constant during the time period when the sediment layer was formed  that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium  and that the thorium cannot shift within the sediment layer  27][28   a thorium atom has 90 electrons  of which four are valence electrons  three atomic orbitals are theoretically available for the valence electrons to occupy  5f  6d  and 7s  33  despite thorium s position in the f-block of the periodic table  it has an anomalous [rn 6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state  as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy  even more so than the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides  thorium s 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells  because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised  such unusual behaviour is due to relativistic effects  which are increasingly stronger near the bottom of the periodic table  specifically the relativistic spin u2013orbit interaction  the closeness in energy levels of the 5f  6d  and 7s energy levels of thorium result in thorium almost always losing all four of its valence electrons and hence occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4  this behaviour is quite distinct from that of its lanthanide congener cerium  for whom +4 is the highest possible state but +3 also plays an important role and is more stable  therefore  thorium is much more similar to the transition metals zirconium and hafnium than to its true lanthanide congener cerium in its properties such as ionisation energies and redox potentials  and hence also in its chemistry  12][34   despite this anomalous electron configuration for gaseous thorium atoms  however  metallic thorium atoms show significant 5f involvement  this was first realised in 1995  when it was pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the [rn 6d27s2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above the fermi level should be hexagonal close packed like the group 4 elements titanium  zirconium  and hafnium  and not face-centered cubic as it actually is  indeed  the correct crystal structure can only be obtained when the 5f states are included  proving that thorium  and not protactinium  acts as the first actinide metallurgically with the clear influence of the 5f orbitals  8  the 5f character of thorium is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state  in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration [rn 5f1.[35   tetravalent thorium compounds are usually colourless or yellow  like those of silver or lead  as the th4  ion has no 5f or 6d electrons  7  thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is slight enough to not pose major problems of handling and accessibility and they may be safely handled in a normal laboratory  35   thorium is a highly reactive and electropositive metal  finely divided thorium metal presents a fire hazard due to its pyrophoricity and must therefore be handled carefully  6  when heated in air  thorium turnings ignite and burn brilliantly with a white light to produce the dioxide  in bulk  the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow  although corrosion may eventually occur after several months  most thorium samples are contaminated with varying degrees of the dioxide  which greatly accelerates corrosion  6  such samples slowly tarnish in air  becoming grey and finally black at the surface  6   at standard temperature and pressure  thorium is slowly attacked by water  but does not readily dissolve in most common acids  with the exception of hydrochloric acid  where it dissolves leaving behind a black insoluble residue  tho oh cl h  6][36  it dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions  6][37  if these are not present  passivation can occur  similarly to uranium and plutonium  6][38   most binary compounds of thorium with nonmetals may simply be prepared by heating the elements together  39  in air  thorium burns to form the simple dioxide  tho2  also called thoria or thorina  this has the fluorite structure  40  thoria  a refractory material  has the highest melting point (3390\xa0\xb0c  of all known oxides  41  it is somewhat hygroscopic and reacts readily with water and many gases  42  but dissolves easily in concentrated nitric acid in the presence of fluoride  43  when heated  it emits intense blue light through incandescence  which becomes white when mixed with its lighter homologue cerium dioxide (ceo2  ceria   this is the basis for its previously common application in gas mantles  42  several binary thorium chalcogenides and oxychalcogenides are also known with sulfur  selenium  and tellurium  44   all four thorium tetrahalides are known  as are some low-valent bromides and iodides  45  the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water  46  additionally  many related polyhalide ions are also known  45  thorium tetrafluoride has a monoclinic crystal structure and is isotypic with zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride  where the th4  ions are coordinated with f u2212 ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms  45  the other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry  46  lower iodides thi3  black  and thi2  gold  can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal  these do not contain th iii  and th ii   but instead contain th4  and could be more clearly formulated as electride compounds  45  many polynary halides with the alkali metals  barium  thallium  and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides  chlorides  and bromides  45  for example  when treated with potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid  th4  forms the complex anion thf2\u2212\n6  which precipitates as an insoluble salt  k2thf6.[37   thorium borides  carbides  silicides  and nitrides are refractory materials  as are those of uranium and plutonium  and have thus received attention as possible nuclear fuels  39  all four heavier pnictogens  phosphorus  arsenic  antimony  and bismuth  also form binary thorium compounds  thorium germanides are also known  47  thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides thh2 and th4h15  the latter of which is superconducting below the transition temperature of 7.5\u20138\xa0k  at standard temperature and pressure  it conducts electricity like a metal  48  they are thermally unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture  39   in acidic aqueous solution  thorium occurs as the tetrapositive aqua ion [th h2o 9]4   which has tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry  49][50  at ph xa0&lt  xa03  the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by this cation  49  the th4  ion is the largest of the tetrapositive actinide ions  and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95\xa0and xa01.14\xa0\xc5.[49  it is quite acidic due to its high charge  slightly stronger than sulfurous acid  thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation  though to a lesser extent than fe3    predominantly to [th2(oh 2]6  in solutions with ph 3 or below  but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide th oh 4 is formed and precipitates out  though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached  because the polymerisation usually slows down significantly just before the precipitation   51  as a hard lewis acid  th4  favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors  complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis  12   large coordination numbers are the rule for thorium due to its large size  thorium nitrate pentahydrate was the first known example of coordination number 11  the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number 10  and the borohydride  first prepared in the manhattan project  has coordination number 14.[51  the distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility  not only in water  but also in polar organic solvents  7   many other inorganic thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known  such as the perchlorates  sulfates  sulfites  nitrates  carbonates  phosphates  vanadates  molybdates  and chromates  and their hydrated forms  52  they are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste  but most of them have not yet been fully characterised  especially regarding their structural properties  52  for example  thorium nitrate is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid  it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds  52  thorium complexes with organic ligands  such as oxalate  citrate  and edta  are much stronger and tend to occur naturally in natural thorium-containing waters in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes  49   most of the work on organothorium compounds has focused on the cyclopentadienyls and cyclooctatetraenyls  like many of the early and middle actinides  up to americium  and also expected for curium   thorium forms the yellow cyclooctatetraenide complex th c8h8)2  thorocene  it is isotypic with the better-known analogous uranium compound  uranocene  53  it can be prepared by reacting k2c8h8 with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran  thf  at the temperature of dry ice  or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with mgc8h8.[53  it is an unstable compound in air and outright decomposes in water or at 190\xa0\xb0c  53  half-sandwich compounds are also known  such as (\u03b78-c8h8)thcl2(thf 2  which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran  12   the simplest of the cyclopentadienyls are th c5h5)3 and th c5h5)4  many derivatives are known  the former  which has two forms  one purple and one green  is a rare example of thorium in the formal +3 oxidation state  53][54  a formal +2 oxidation state even occurs in a derivative  55  the chloride derivative [th c5h5)3cl  is prepared by heating thorium tetrachloride with limiting k c5h5  used  other univalent metal cyclopentadienyls can also be used   the alkyl and aryl derivatives are prepared from the chloride derivative and have received attention due to the insight they give regarding the nature of the th u2013c sigma bond  54   other organothorium compounds are not well-studied  tetrabenzylthorium  th ch2c6h5   and tetraallylthorium  th c3h5)4  are known  but their structures have not yet been determined and they decompose slowly at room temperature  thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion [th ch3)7]3\u2212  heptamethylthorate  which forms the salt [li tmeda  3[thme7   tmeda   me2nch2ch2nme2   although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom (th u2013c distance 257.1\xa0pm  and the other six connect the lithium and thorium atoms (th u2013c distances 265.5\u2013276.5\xa0pm  they behave equivalently in solution  tetramethylthorium  th ch3)4  is not known  but its adducts are stabilised by phosphine ligands  12   232th is a primordial nuclide  having existed in its current form for over ten billion years  it was forged in the cores of dying stars through the r-process and scattered across the galaxy by supernovae  56  the letter  r  stands for  rapid neutron capture   and occurs in core-collapse supernovae  where heavy seed nuclei such as 56fe rapidly capture neutrons  running up against the neutron drip line  as neutrons are captured much faster than the resulting nuclides can beta decay back toward stability  neutron capture is the only way for stars to synthesise elements beyond iron because of the increased coulomb barriers that make interactions between charged particles difficult at high atomic numbers and the fact that fusion beyond 56fe is endothermic  57  because of the abrupt loss of stability past 209bi  the r-process is the only process of stellar nucleosynthesis that can create isotopes of thorium and uranium  because all other processes are too slow and the intermediate nuclei alpha decay before they capture enough neutrons to reach these elements  56][58][59   in the universe  thorium is among the rarest of the primordial elements  it achieves this position not only because it is one of the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process  with the other one being uranium   but also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed  the only primordial elements rarer than thorium are thulium  lutetium  tantalum  and rhenium  the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals  56][57  d  furthermore  neutron capture by nuclides beyond the end of the line of beta stability at a   209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption  reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become thorium  on earth  thorium is much more abundant  with an abundance of 8.1\xa0ppm in the earth s crust  it is one of the most abundant of the heavy elements  almost as abundant as lead (13\xa0ppm  and significantly more abundant than tin (2.1\xa0ppm   60  this is because thorium  being a lithophile  is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core  on the other hand  the heavy platinum group metals have no affinity for oxygen and their oxides may even be thermodynamically unstable with respect to the elements  instead  they readily dissolve in iron and sink down with it into the core  furthermore  thorium compounds are also poorly soluble in water  61   natural thorium is essentially isotopically pure 232th  which is the longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium  having a half-life comparable to the age of the universe  16  its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the earth s internal heat  the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial nuclides  238u  40k and 235u  62  the other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter-lived  of them  only 230th is usually detectable  occurring in secular equilibrium with its parent 238u  and making up at most 0.04  of natural thorium  16  e   on earth  thorium is not a rare element as was previously thought  having a crustal abundance comparable to that of lead and molybdenum  twice that of arsenic  and thrice that of tin  64  thorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals  64  soil normally contains about 6 parts per million  ppm  of thorium  65   in nature  thorium occurs in the +4 oxidation state  together with uranium iv   zirconium iv   hafnium iv   and cerium iv   but also with scandium  yttrium  and the trivalent lanthanides which have similar ionic radii  64  because of thorium s radioactivity  minerals containing significant quantities of thorium are often metamict  their crystal structure having been partially or totally destroyed by the alpha radiation produced in the radioactive decay of thorium  66  an extreme example is ekanite  (ca fe pb 2(th u si8o20  which almost never occurs in nonmetamict form due to thorium being an essential part of its chemical composition  67   monazite is the most important commercial source of thorium because it occurs in large deposits worldwide  principally in india  south africa  brazil  australia  and malaysia  it contains around 2.5  thorium on average  although some deposits may contain up to 20  thorium  64][68  monazite is a chemically unreactive phosphate mineral that is found as yellow or brown sand  its low reactivity makes it difficult to extract thorium from it  64  allanite can have 0.1\u20132  thorium and zircon up to 0.4  thorium  64   thorium dioxide occurs as the rare mineral thorianite  which usually contains up to 12  tho2  due to its being isotypic with uranium dioxide  these two common actinide dioxides can form solid-state solutions and the name of the mineral changes according to the tho2 content  64  f  thorite  or tetragonal thorium silicate (thsio4   also has a high thorium content and is the mineral in which thorium was first discovered  64  in thorium silicate minerals  the th4  and sio4\u2212\n4 ions are often replaced with m3   m   sc  y  ln  and phosphate (po3\u2212\n4  ions respectively  64  because of the great insolubility of thorium dioxide  thorium does not usually spread quickly through the environment when released in significant quantities  the th4  ion is soluble  especially in acidic soils  and in such conditions the thorium concentration can reach 40\xa0ppm  69   in 1815  the swedish chemist j xf6ns jakob berzelius analysed an unusual sample of gadolinite from a copper mine in falun  central sweden  he noted impregnated traces of a white mineral  which he cautiously assumed to be an earth  oxide in modern chemical nomenclature  of an unknown element   by that time  berzelius had already discovered two elements  cerium and selenium  but he had made a public mistake once  announcing a new element  gahnium  that turned out to be simply zinc oxide   71  berzelius privately named the supposed tentative element  thorium  in 1817[72  and its supposed oxide  thorina  after thor  the norse god of thunder  73  in 1824  after more deposits of the same mineral in vest-agder  norway  were discovered  he retracted his findings  as the mineral in question proved to actually be an yttrium mineral  primarily composed of yttrium orthophosphate  30][71][74][75  as the yttrium in this mineral was initially mistaken as being a new element  the mineral was named kenotime by the french mineralogist fran xe7ois sulpice beudant as a rebuke of berzelius  from the greek words \u03ba u03b5\u03bd u03cc u03c2  vain  and \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc u03ae  honour   this became  xenotime  as a misprint from the beginning  blunting the criticism  71][75][76  this misspelt form was later explained as being from \u03be u03b5\u03bd u03cc u03c2  stranger to  and \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc u03ae  honour   supposedly referencing the small  rare and easily overlooked crystals that xenotime occurs as  77   in 1828  morten thrane esmark found a black mineral on l xf8v xf8ya island  telemark county  norway  he was a norwegian priest and amateur mineralogist who studied the minerals in telemark  where he served as vicar  he commonly sent the most interesting specimens  such as this one  to his father  jens esmark  a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the university of oslo  78  the elder esmark determined that it was not any known mineral and sent a sample to berzelius for examination  berzelius determined that it contained a new element  30  he published his findings in 1829  having isolated an impure sample for the first time by reducing kthf5 with potassium metal  79][80][81  berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery  79][82  thus  he named the source mineral thorite  which has the chemical composition (th u sio4.[30  berzelius also made some initial characterisation of the new metal and its chemical compounds  he correctly determined that the thorium u2013oxygen mass ratio was 7.5  its actual value is close to that  ~7.3   but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent  and as such assumed that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 amu   while it is actually 15 times as large  g  he determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal  that he placed ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity  83  berzelius did not isolate the element in its metallic state  for the first time  thorium was isolated in 1914 by d  lely jr  and l  hamburger  they obtained 99  pure thorium metal by reducing thorium chloride with sodium metal  84  h  a simpler method leading to even higher purity was discovered in 1927 by marden and rentschler  involving the reduction of thorium oxide with calcium when calcium chloride was present  84   in dmitri mendeleev s 1869 periodic table  thorium and the rare earth elements were placed outside the main body of the table  at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals  this reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare earth metals were divalent  with the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent  mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group iv in 1871  which contained the modern carbon group  group 14   titanium group  group 4   cerium  and thorium  because their maximum oxidation state was +4.[86][87  cerium was soon removed from the main body of the table and placed in a separate lanthanide series  while thorium remained with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group  such as titanium and zirconium  88  i   although thorium was discovered in 1828  it had no applications until 1885  when carl auer von welsbach invented the gas mantle  a portable source of light which produces light from the incandescence of very hot thorium oxide  heated to extremely high temperatures by burning gaseous fuels  30  after 1885  many applications were found for thorium and its compounds  such as in ceramics  carbon arc lamps  heat-resistant crucibles  and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid   in the late 19th century onward  the atomic theory underwent significant improvements  which shaped the further history of thorium  thorium was first observed to be radioactive in 1898  independently  by the german chemist gerhard carl schmidt and later that year  the polish-french physicist marie curie  it was the second element that was found to be radioactive  after the 1896 discovery of radioactivity in uranium by henri becquerel  89][90][91  between 1900 and 1903  ernest rutherford and frederick soddy showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements  this observation led to the identification of half-life as one of the outcomes of the alpha particle experiments that led to their disintegration theory of radioactivity  92  the biological effect of radiation was discovered in 1903;[93  the danger presented by radioactivity to health and environment was the reason thorium was phased out of use in applications that did not explicitly use the radioactivity  30  since the 1930s  it has been widely acknowledged that thorium possesses a minor threat to human organisms in large quantities   in 1922  niels bohr published a theoretical model of the atom and its electron orbitals  which soon gathered wide acceptance  the model indicated that the seventh row of the periodic table should also have f-shells filling before the d-shells that were filled in the transition elements  like the sixth row with the lanthanides preceding the 5d transition metals  86  such a second extra-long periodic table row  to accommodate known and undiscovered elements with an atomic weight greater than bismuth  thorium  protactinium  and uranium  for example   had been postulated as far back as 1892 by henry bassett  who considered thorium and uranium to be members of a second series of rare earths  and predicted that more elements would be found within this series  most investigators considered on the basis of their chemical properties that these elements were analogous to the 5d transition elements hafnium  tantalum  and tungsten  and considered the existence of the lanthanides in the sixth row to be a one-off fluke  the existence of a second inner transition series  in the form of the actinides  was not accepted until similarities with the electron structures of the lanthanides had been established  94  it was only with the discovery of the first transuranic elements  which from plutonium onward have dominant +3 and +4 oxidation states  neptunium having +4 and +5 as dominant states and +7 as an unstable state   that it was realised that the actinides were indeed filling f-orbitals rather than d-orbitals  95  thus it was not until 1945  after glenn t  seaborg and his team had discovered the transuranic elements americium and curium  that seaborg realised that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f-block row  instead of being the heavier congener of hafnium and filling a fourth d-block row  88  today  thorium s similarities to hafnium are still sometimes acknowledged by calling it a  pseudo group-4 element   96   despite thorium s radioactivity  the element has remained in use for a long time for applications not exploiting the effect as no suitable alternatives could be found  while a 1981 study estimated that a dose from using a thorium mantle every weekend would be safe for a person  97][98  this was not the case for people manufacturing the mantles  and thus contacting many  as well as soils around some factory sites  99  a major shift occurred as late as in the 1990s  when most of these applications that do not depend on thorium s radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements have been found  30][100  due to concerns  some manufacturers have switched to other materials  such as yttrium  although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient  other manufacturers continue to make thorium mantles  but moved their factories to developing countries  98  as recently as 2007  some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their radioactivity  with some even fraudulently claiming them to be non-radioactive while in reality using large quantities of thorium  up to 259\xa0milligrams per mantle  100][101   efforts have been applied to initiate usage of thorium and its radioactivity as a power source  the earliest thorium-based reactor was made in u s  the first core at the indian point energy center in 1962.[102  india has one of the largest supplies of thorium in the world but does not have much uranium used elsewhere  and targeted in the 1950s at achieving energy independence for the country with their three-stage nuclear power programme  103][104  on the other hand  in most countries  the progress staggered because uranium was relatively abundant and the progress of thorium-based reactors was therefore slow  in the 20th century  3 reactors were opened in india and 12 elsewhere 105    large-scale research was begun in 1996 by the international atomic energy agency  iaea  to study the use of thorium reactors  a year later  the u s  energy department began their research on the matter  nuclear scientist alvin radkowsky of tel aviv university in israel  the head designer of the american first civilian nuclear power plant at shippingport  pennsylvania whose third core bred thorium  106  founded a consortium to develop thorium reactors  which included other companies  raytheon nuclear inc  and brookhaven national laboratory in the u s  and the kurchatov institute in russia  107  in the 21st century  thorium s potential for improving proliferation resistance and waste characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle  108][109][110   thorium is extracted mostly from monazite  thorium pyrophosphate (thp2o7  is reacted with nitric acid  and the produced thorium nitrate treated with tributyl phosphate  rare-earth impurities are separated by increasing the ph in sulfate solution  112   in another extraction method  monazite is decomposed with a 45  aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide at 140\xa0\xb0c  mixed metal hydroxides are extracted first  filtered at 80\xa0\xb0c  washed with water and dissolved with concentrated hydrochloric acid  next  the acidic solution is neutralised with hydroxides to ph   5.8 that results in precipitation of thorium hydroxide (th oh 4  contaminated with ~3  of rare-earth hydroxides  the remaining rare-earth hydroxides remain in solution  thorium hydroxide is dissolved in an inorganic acid and then purified from the rare earth elements  an efficient method is the dissolution of thorium hydroxide in nitric acid  because the resulting solution can be purified by extraction with organic solvents  112   metallic thorium is separated from the anhydrous oxide or chloride by reacting it with calcium in an inert atmosphere  68   sometimes thorium is extracted by electrolysis of a fluoride in a mixture of sodium and potassium chloride at 700\u2013800\xa0\xb0c in a graphite crucible  highly pure thorium can be extracted from its iodide with the crystal bar process  113   since thorium has few applications today  only a few hundred tonnes of it are produced each year  mostly as a by-product of the production of uranium and the lanthanides  and even these meagre quantities exceed the current demand for thorium  114  half of this thorium produced is used in gas mantles  nevertheless  production could easily be increased  and probably would be if thorium became used in large quantities as nuclear fuel  68  present knowledge of the distribution of thorium resources is poor because of the relatively low-key exploration efforts arising out of insignificant demand  115   many applications of thorium are becoming obsolete due to environmental concerns largely stemming from the radioactivity of thorium and its decay products  thorium is thus being phased out of many of its uses  30][100   thorium is used in gas tungsten arc welding  gtaw  to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability  116  in electronic equipment  thorium coating of tungsten wire improves the electron emission of heated cathodes  36   thorium is added to tungsten because it lowers the effective work function with the result that the thoriated tungsten thermocathode emits electrons at considerably lower temperatures  30  this is used in thoriated tungsten elements found in the filaments of vacuum tubes  e g  magnetron found in microwave oven   many applications of thorium use  rather than the metal  its dioxide  commonly called  thoria  in the industry  the melting point of thoria is 3300\xa0\xb0c \u2013 the highest of all known oxides  only a few substances have higher melting points  41  this means that when heated to high temperatures  vague  it does not melt  but merely glows with an intense blue light  addition of cerium dioxide gives a bright white light  42  sometimes thorium nitrate is used instead  because it will thermally decompose to thoria at high temperatures  this property of thoria is used in thorium mantles of portable gas lights  including natural gas lamps  oil lamps and camping lights  117  additionally  thoria is a material for heat-resistant ceramics  as used in high-temperature laboratory crucibles  30   when added to glass  thoria helps increase refractive index and decrease dispersion  such glass finds application in high-quality lenses for cameras and scientific instruments  36  the radiation from these lenses can darken them and turn them yellow over a period of years and degrade film  but the health risks are minimal  118  yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colourless state with lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation   thoria has been used as a chemical catalyst in the conversion of ammonia to nitric acid  30  in petroleum cracking and in producing sulfuric acid  30   thorium tetrafluoride is used as an antireflection material in multilayered optical coatings  it has an optical transparency in the range of 0.35\u201312\xa0\xb5m  and its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles  which can be easily stopped by a thin cover layer of another material  119  thorium tetrafluoride was also used in manufacturing carbon arc lamps  which provided high-intensity illumination for movie projectors and search lights  117   in thermal breeder reactors  the fertile c  isotope 232th is bombarded by slow neutrons  undergoing neutron capture to become 233th  which undergoes two consecutive beta decays to become first 233pa and then the fissile 233u  30   233u is fissile and hence can be used as a nuclear fuel in much the same way as the more-commonly used 235u or 239pu  when 233u undergoes nuclear fission  the neutrons emitted can strike further 232th nuclei  restarting the cycle  30  this closely parallels the uranium fuel cycle in fast breeder reactors where 238u undergoes neutron capture to become 239u  beta decaying to first 239np and then fissile 239pu  120  the main advantage of the thorium fuel cycle is that thorium is more abundant than uranium and hence can satisfy world energy demands for longer  furthermore  232th absorbs neutrons more readily than 238u  and not only does 233u have a higher probability of fission upon neutron capture (92.0   than 235u (85.5   or 239pu (73.5%),[121  it also releases more neutrons upon fission on average  122  an added advantage 233u and 239pu enjoy over all other fissile nuclei  except the naturally occurring 235u  is that they can be bred from neutron capture by the naturally occurring quantity isotopes 232th and 238u  123][124  j  thorium fuels also result in a safer and better-performing reactor core 30  because thoria has a higher melting point  higher thermal conductivity  and lower coefficient of thermal expansion than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide (uo2   thoria is also more chemically stable as  unlike uranium dioxide  it does not further oxidise to triuranium octoxide (u3o8).[125  furthermore  while a single neutron capture by 238u would produce transuranic waste  along with it fissile 239pu  five captures are generally necessary to do so from 232th  98\u201399  of thorium-cycle fuel nuclei would fission at either 233u or 235u  so fewer long-lived transuranics are produced  because of this  thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in mixed oxide  mox  fuels to minimise the generation of transuranics and maximise the destruction of plutonium  126   the main disadvantage is that it is difficult and dangerous to reprocess the used fuel because many of the daughters of 232th and 233u are strong gamma emitters  122  additionally  all 233u production methods other than mercury fluourescence always result in significant impurities of the very dangerous gamma emitter 232u  either from parasitic (n 2n  reactions on 232th  233pa  or 233u that result in the loss of a neutron  or from double neutron capture of 230th  an impurity in natural 232th  127   these impurities of 232u make 233u very easy to detect and very dangerous to work on  and the impracticality of their separation limits the possibilities of nuclear proliferation using 233u as the fissile material  127  additionally  233pa has a relatively long half-life of 27\xa0days and a high cross section for neutron capture  thus it is a neutron poison  instead of rapidly decaying to the useful 233u  a significant amount of 233pa converts to 234u and consumes neutrons  degrading the reactor efficiency  to avoid this  233pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium molten salt reactors during their operation  so that it only decays to 233u  128   another disadvantage of the thorium fuel cycle is the need to neutron-irradiate and process natural 232th before these advantages become real  and this requires more advanced technology than the presently used fuels based on uranium and plutonium  nevertheless  advances are being made in this technology  30  another common criticism centres around the low commercial viability of the thorium fuel cycle  129][130][131  some entities like the nuclear energy agency go further and predict that the thorium cycle will never be commercially viable while uranium is available in abundance u2014a situation which trevor findlay predicts will persist  in the coming decades   132  furthermore  though the isotopes produced in the thorium fuel cycle are not transuranic  some of them are still very dangerous  such as 231pa  which has a long half-life of 32760\xa0years and is a major contributor to the long term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel  128   thorium is odourless and tasteless  133  as thorium occurs naturally  it exists in very small quantities almost everywhere on earth  the average human contains about 100\xa0micrograms of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day of thorium  134  this exposure is raised for people who live near uranium  phosphate  or tin processing factories  thorium deposits  radioactive waste disposal sites  and for those who work in uranium  thorium  tin  or phosphate mining or gas mantle production industries  135  thorium is especially common in the tamil nadu coastal areas of india  where residents may be exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average  136  when thorium is ingested  99.98  does not remain in the body  out of the thorium that does remain in the body  three quarters of it accumulates in the skeleton  while absorption through the skin is possible  it is not a likely means of thorium exposure  137   natural thorium decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials  and the alpha radiation emitted cannot penetrate human skin  as a result  owning and handling small amounts of thorium  such as those in a gas mantle  is considered safe  although usage of such items may pose some risks  137  exposure to an aerosol of thorium  such as contaminated dust  can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung  pancreas  and blood  as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation  137  exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases  138   although 232th is only mildly radioactive  it decays into more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon  a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232th must include the contribution of its daughters  such as 228ra  which are dangerous gamma emitters  139  there are concerns about the safety of thorium mantles  as the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thoria  except of course 228th  which is chemically identical to its parent 232th   and they would be volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use  for example  during burning  significant fractions of the thorium daughters 224ra  228ra  212pb  and 212bi are released in the first hour of use alone  140  most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium  resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2\xa0millisieverts per use  about a third of the dose sustained during a mammogram  141  if a mantle is ingested  0.4  of the thorium and 90  of its dangerous daughters are leached into the body  101  some nuclear safety agencies make recommendations about their use  and have raised some safety concerns regarding their manufacture and disposal  because while the radiation dose from one mantle is not a serious problem  that from many mantles gathered together in factories or landfills is  138   the chemical toxicity of thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds  mostly the dioxide  are poorly soluble in water  142  nevertheless  some thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic  people who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of dermatitis  it can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves  134   powdered thorium metal is pyrophoric and often ignites spontaneously in air  6  in the 1956 sylvania electric products explosion  the burning of thorium metal powder sludge led to nine injuries  some severe  as well as one death from thorium poisoning  143][144][145
