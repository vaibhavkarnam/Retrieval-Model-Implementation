PelamisWaveEnergyConverter
 the pelamis wave energy converter was a technology that used the motion of ocean surface waves to create electricity  the machine was made up of connected sections which flex and bend as waves pass  it is this motion which is used to generate electricity   developed by the now defunct [1  scottish company pelamis wave power  formerly ocean power delivery   the pelamis became the first offshore wave machine to generate electricity into the grid  when it was first connected to the uk grid in 2004.[2  pelamis wave power then went on to build and test five additional pelamis machines  three first-generation p1 machines  which were tested in a farm off the coast of portugal in 2009  and two second-generation machines  the pelamis p2  were tested off orkney between 2010 and 2014  the company went into administration in november 2014  with the intellectual property transferred to the scottish government body wave energy scotland  3       the pelamis machine is an offshore wave energy converter  operating in water depths greater than 50m  the machine consists of a series of semi-submerged cylindrical sections linked by hinged joints  as waves pass along the length of the machine  the sections move relative to one another  the wave-induced motion of the sections is resisted by hydraulic cylinders which pump high pressure oil through hydraulic motors via smoothing hydraulic accumulators  the hydraulic motors drive electrical generators to produce electricity  electricity from all the joints is fed down a single umbilical cable to a junction on the sea bed  several devices can be connected and linked to shore through a single seabed cable   the pelamis is an attenuating wave energy converter  the machine responds to the curvature of the waves  their shape  rather than the wave height  as waves can only reach a certain curvature before naturally breaking  this limits the range of motion through which the machine must move but maintains large motion at the joints in small waves   the p2 pelamis design was pelamis wave power s second generation pelamis machine  the pelamis p2 is 180m long  4m diameter and approximately 1350 tonnes in weight  consisting of five tube sections and four flexible joints  the design is longer and fatter than the previous p1 design   in 2010  pelamis wave power began tests of the first pelamis p2 machine at the european marine energy centre  orkney  scotland  the machine was owned by the german utility company  e on  and was the uk s first commercial supply contract in the marine energy sector  4  in march 2010 pelamis wave power announced a second order for a p2 machine  from scottishpower renewables  part of iberdrola renovables  5  this second machine was first installed at emec in may 2012.[6  the two utility companies announced that they will work together to share and collaborate in testing of the p2 pelamis technology  7   following the demise of the company  the p2-001 device was acquired by wave energy scotland  having completed over 15,000 hours of operation  the device was decommissioned in april 2016  the other device  p2-002 was sold to the european marine energy centre for use as a test rig  8   e on and scottishpower renewables announced plans to build larger projects using pelamis machines in the waters off orkney s west coast  9  both companies won leases in 2010 from the crown estate  who own the seabed around the uk  for projects of up to 50mw  the  pentland firth and orkney waters leasing round  was the world s first commercial scale wave and tidal energy leasing opportunity  10   pelamis wave power tested their first full-scale prototype at the european marine energy centre in orkney  scotland between 2004 and 2007  the machine  which was rated at 750\xa0kw  was the world s first offshore wave power machine to generate electricity into the grid system   the prototype was 120m long and 3.5m in diameter  it consisted of four tube sections linked by three  shorter  and power conversion modules 11   in 2008 pelamis tested three first generation  p1 pelamis waves at the agu xe7adoura wave farm  located off the northwest coast of portugal near p xf3voa de varzim  the farm had an installed capacity of 2.25mw and was the world s first multiple machine wave power project  12  the project was part funded by portuguese utility enersis  13  at the time owned by australian global investment company babcock  amp  brown  14  the farm first generated electricity in july 2008 but was taken offline in november 2008 at the same time as babcock  amp  brown encountered financial difficulties  15   pelamis platurus is a yellow-bellied sea snake that lives in tropical and subtropical waters  it prefers shallow inshore waters   2 of 3 pelamis machines in the harbour of peniche  portugal   pelamis prototype machine at emec   the front of the pelamis machine bursting through a wave at the agu xe7adoura wave park  1 of 3 pelamis machines at the agu xe7adoura wave farm
