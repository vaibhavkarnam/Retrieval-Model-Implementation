 ecosophy or ecophilosophy  a portmanteau of ecological philosophy  is a philosophy of ecological harmony or equilibrium  the term was coined by the norwegian father of deep ecology  arne n xe6ss  and french post-marxist philosopher and psychoanalyst f xe9lix guattari       naess defined ecosophy in the following way   by an ecosophy i mean a philosophy of ecological harmony or equilibrium  a philosophy as a kind of sofia  or  wisdom  is openly normative  it contains both norms  rules  postulates  value priority announcements and hypotheses concerning the state of affairs in our universe  wisdom is policy wisdom  prescription  not only scientific description and prediction  the details of an ecosophy will show many variations due to significant differences concerning not only the  facts  of pollution  resources  population  etc  but also value priorities   while a professor at university of oslo in 1972  arne n xe6ss  introduced the terms  deep ecology movement  and  ecosophy  into environmental literature  naess based his article on a talk he gave in bucharest in 1972 at the third world future research conference  as drengson notes in ecophilosophy  ecosophy and the deep ecology movement  an overview   in his talk n xe6ss discussed the longer-range background of the ecology movement and its connection with respect for nature and the inherent worth of other beings   naess s view of humans as an integral part of a  total-field image 1   of nature contrasts with the alternative  and more anthropocentric  construction of ecosophy outlined by guattari   the term ecological wisdom  synonymous with ecosophy  was introduced by n xe6ss in 1973  the concept has become one of the foundations of the deep ecology movement  all expressions of values by green parties list ecological wisdom as a key value u2014it was one of the original four pillars of the green party and is often considered the most basic value of these parties  it is also often associated with indigenous religion and cultural practices  in its political context  it is necessarily not as easily defined as ecological health or scientific ecology concepts   ecosophy also refers to a field of practice introduced by psychoanalyst  poststructuralist philosopher and political activist f xe9lix guattari  in part guattari s use of the term demarcates what he observes as the necessity for the proponents of social liberation whose struggles in the 20th century were dominated by the paradigm of social revolution and marxism to embed their arguments within an ecological framework which understands the interconnections of social and environmental spheres   guattari holds that traditional environmentalist perspectives obscure the complexity of the relationship between humans and their natural environment through its maintenance of the dualistic separation of human  cultural  and nonhuman  natural  systems  he envisions ecosophy as a new field with a monistic and pluralistic approach to such study  ecology in the guattarian sense  then  is a study of complex phenomena  including human subjectivity  the environment  and social relations  all of which are intimately interconnected  despite this emphasis on interconnection  throughout his individual writings and more famous collaborations with gilles deleuze  guattari has resisted calls for holism  preferring to emphasize heterogeneity and difference  synthesizing assemblages and multiplicities in order to trace rhizomatic structures rather than creating unified and holistic structures   without modifications to the social and material environment  there can be no change in mentalities  here  we are in the presence of a circle that leads me to postulate the necessity of founding an  ecosophy  that would link environmental ecology to social ecology and to mental ecology   guattari s concept of the three interacting and interdependent ecologies of mind  society  and environment stems from the outline of the three ecologies presented in steps to an ecology of mind  a collection of writings by cyberneticist gregory bateson
