Fuelcell
 a fuel cell is a device that converts the chemical energy from a fuel into electricity through a chemical reaction of positively charged hydrogen ions with oxygen or another oxidizing agent  1  fuel cells are different from batteries in requiring a continuous source of fuel and oxygen or air to sustain the chemical reaction  whereas in a battery the chemicals present in the battery react with each other to generate an electromotive force  emf   fuel cells can produce electricity continuously for as long as these inputs are supplied   the first fuel cells were invented in 1838  the first commercial use of fuel cells came more than a century later in nasa space programs to generate power for satellites and space capsules  since then  fuel cells have been used in many other applications  fuel cells are used for primary and backup power for commercial  industrial and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible areas  they are also used to power fuel cell vehicles  including forklifts  automobiles  buses  boats  motorcycles and submarines   there are many types of fuel cells  but they all consist of an anode  a cathode  and an electrolyte that allows positively charged hydrogen ions  protons  to move between the two sides of the fuel cell  the anode and cathode contain catalysts that cause the fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate positively charged hydrogen ions and electrons  the hydrogen ions are drawn through the electrolyte after the reaction  at the same time  electrons are drawn from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit  producing direct current electricity  at the cathode  hydrogen ions  electrons  and oxygen react to form water  as the main difference among fuel cell types is the electrolyte  fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use and by the difference in startup time ranging from 1 second for proton exchange membrane fuel cells  pem fuel cells  or pemfc  to 10 minutes for solid oxide fuel cells  sofc   individual fuel cells produce relatively small electrical potentials  about 0.7 volts  so cells are  stacked   or placed in series  to create sufficient voltage to meet an application s requirements  2  in addition to electricity  fuel cells produce water  heat and  depending on the fuel source  very small amounts of nitrogen dioxide and other emissions  the energy efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40\u201360   or up to 85  efficient in cogeneration if waste heat is captured for use   the fuel cell market is growing  and in 2013 pike research estimated that the stationary fuel cell market will reach 50 gw by 2020.[3   the first references to hydrogen fuel cells appeared in 1838  in a letter dated october 1838 but published in the december 1838 edition of the london and edinburgh philosophical magazine and journal of science  welsh physicist and barrister william grove wrote about the development of his first crude fuel cells  he used a combination of sheet iron  copper and porcelain plates  and a solution of sulphate of copper and dilute acid  4][5  in a letter to the same publication written in december 1838 but published in june 1839  german physicist christian friedrich sch xf6nbein discussed the first crude fuel cell that he had invented  his letter discussed current generated from hydrogen and oxygen dissolved in water  6  grove later sketched his design  in 1842  in the same journal  the fuel cell he made used similar materials to today s phosphoric-acid fuel cell  7][8   in 1939  british engineer francis thomas bacon successfully developed a 5\xa0kw stationary fuel cell  in 1955  w  thomas grubb  a chemist working for the general electric company  ge   further modified the original fuel cell design by using a sulphonated polystyrene ion-exchange membrane as the electrolyte  three years later another ge chemist  leonard niedrach  devised a way of depositing platinum onto the membrane  which served as catalyst for the necessary hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions  this became known as the  grubb-niedrach fuel cell   9][10  ge went on to develop this technology with nasa and mcdonnell aircraft  leading to its use during project gemini  this was the first commercial use of a fuel cell  in 1959  a team led by harry ihrig built a 15\xa0kw fuel cell tractor for allis-chalmers  which was demonstrated across the u s  at state fairs  this system used potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and compressed hydrogen and oxygen as the reactants  later in 1959  bacon and his colleagues demonstrated a practical five-kilowatt unit capable of powering a welding machine  in the 1960s  pratt and whitney licensed bacon s u s  patents for use in the u s  space program to supply electricity and drinking water  hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks   in 1991  the first hydrogen fuel cell automobile was developed by roger billings  11][12   utc power was the first company to manufacture and commercialize a large  stationary fuel cell system for use as a co-generation power plant in hospitals  universities and large office buildings  13   in recognition of the fuel cell industry and america u2019s role in fuel cell development  the us senate recognized october 8  2015 as national hydrogen and fuel cell day  passing s  res 217  the date was chosen in recognition of the atomic weight of hydrogen (1.008).[14   fuel cells come in many varieties  however  they all work in the same general manner  they are made up of three adjacent segments  the anode  the electrolyte  and the cathode  two chemical reactions occur at the interfaces of the three different segments  the net result of the two reactions is that fuel is consumed  water or carbon dioxide is created  and an electric current is created  which can be used to power electrical devices  normally referred to as the load   at the anode a catalyst oxidizes the fuel  usually hydrogen  turning the fuel into a positively charged ion and a negatively charged electron  the electrolyte is a substance specifically designed so ions can pass through it  but the electrons cannot  the freed electrons travel through a wire creating the electric current  the ions travel through the electrolyte to the cathode  once reaching the cathode  the ions are reunited with the electrons and the two react with a third chemical  usually oxygen  to create water or carbon dioxide   the most important design features in a fuel cell are citation needed    a typical fuel cell produces a voltage from 0.6 v to 0.7 v at full rated load  voltage decreases as current increases  due to several factors   to deliver the desired amount of energy  the fuel cells can be combined in series to yield higher voltage  and in parallel to allow a higher current to be supplied  such a design is called a fuel cell stack  the cell surface area can also be increased  to allow higher current from each cell  within the stack  reactant gases must be distributed uniformly over each of the cells to maximize the power output  16][17][18   in the archetypical hydrogen u2013oxide proton exchange membrane fuel cell design  a proton-conducting polymer membrane  typically nafion  contains the electrolyte solution that separates the anode and cathode sides  19][20  this was called a  solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell   spefc  in the early 1970s  before the proton exchange mechanism was well-understood   notice that the synonyms  polymer electrolyte membrane  and  proton exchange mechanism  result in the same acronym    on the anode side  hydrogen diffuses to the anode catalyst where it later dissociates into protons and electrons  these protons often react with oxidants causing them to become what are commonly referred to as multi-facilitated proton membranes  the protons are conducted through the membrane to the cathode  but the electrons are forced to travel in an external circuit  supplying power  because the membrane is electrically insulating  on the cathode catalyst  oxygen molecules react with the electrons  which have traveled through the external circuit  and protons to form water   in addition to this pure hydrogen type  there are hydrocarbon fuels for fuel cells  including diesel  methanol  see  direct-methanol fuel cells and indirect methanol fuel cells  and chemical hydrides  the waste products with these types of fuel are carbon dioxide and water  when hydrogen is used  the co2 is released when methane from natural gas is combined with steam  in a process called steam methane reforming  to produce the hydrogen  this can take place in a different location to the fuel cell  potentially allowing the hydrogen fuel cell to be used indoors u2014for example  in fork lifts   the different components of a pemfc are  the materials used for different parts of the fuel cells differ by type  the bipolar plates may be made of different types of materials  such as  metal  coated metal  graphite  flexible graphite  c u2013c composite  carbon u2013polymer composites etc  24  the membrane electrode assembly  mea  is referred as the heart of the pemfc and is usually made of a proton exchange membrane sandwiched between two catalyst-coated carbon papers  platinum and or similar type of noble metals are usually used as the catalyst for pemfc  the electrolyte could be a polymer membrane   phosphoric acid fuel cells  pafc  were first designed and introduced in 1961 by g  v  elmore and h  a  tanner  in these cells phosphoric acid is used as a non-conductive electrolyte to pass positive hydrogen ions from the anode to the cathode  these cells commonly work in temperatures of 150 to 200 degrees celsius  this high temperature will cause heat and energy loss if the heat is not removed and used properly  this heat can be used to produce steam for air conditioning systems or any other thermal energy consuming system  33  using this heat in cogeneration can enhance the efficiency of phosphoric acid fuel cells from 40\u201350  to about 80%.[33  phosphoric acid  the electrolyte used in pafcs  is a non-conductive liquid acid which forces electrons to travel from anode to cathode through an external electrical circuit  since the hydrogen ion production rate on the anode is small  platinum is used as catalyst to increase this ionization rate  a key disadvantage of these cells is the use of an acidic electrolyte  this increases the corrosion or oxidation of components exposed to phosphoric acid  34   solid acid fuel cells  safcs  are characterized by the use of a solid acid material as the electrolyte  at low temperatures  solid acids have an ordered molecular structure like most salts  at warmer temperatures  between 140 and 150 degrees celsius for cshso4   some solid acids undergo a phase transition to become highly disordered  superprotonic  structures  which increases conductivity by several orders of magnitude  the first proof-of-concept safcs were developed in 2000 using cesium hydrogen sulfate (cshso4).[35  current safc systems use cesium dihydrogen phosphate (csh2po4  and have demonstrated lifetimes in the thousands of hours  36   the alkaline fuel cell or hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell was designed and first demonstrated publicly by francis thomas bacon in 1959  it was used as a primary source of electrical energy in the apollo space program  37  the cell consists of two porous carbon electrodes impregnated with a suitable catalyst such as pt  ag  coo  etc  the space between the two electrodes is filled with a concentrated solution of koh or naoh which serves as an electrolyte  h2 gas and o2 gas are bubbled into the electrolyte through the porous carbon electrodes  thus the overall reaction involves the combination of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to form water  the cell runs continuously until the reactant s supply is exhausted  this type of cell operates efficiently in the temperature range 343 k to 413 k and provides a potential of about 0.9 v  38   solid oxide fuel cells  sofcs  use a solid material  most commonly a ceramic material called yttria-stabilized zirconia  ysz   as the electrolyte  because sofcs are made entirely of solid materials  they are not limited to the flat plane configuration of other types of fuel cells and are often designed as rolled tubes  they require high operating temperatures (800\u20131000\xa0\xb0c  and can be run on a variety of fuels including natural gas  39   sofcs are unique since in those  negatively charged oxygen ions travel from the cathode  positive side of the fuel cell  to the anode  negative side of the fuel cell  instead of positively charged hydrogen ions travelling from the anode to the cathode  as is the case in all other types of fuel cells  oxygen gas is fed through the cathode  where it absorbs electrons to create oxygen ions  the oxygen ions then travel through the electrolyte to react with hydrogen gas at the anode  the reaction at the anode produces electricity and water as by-products  carbon dioxide may also be a by-product depending on the fuel  but the carbon emissions from an sofc system are less than those from a fossil fuel combustion plant  40  the chemical reactions for the sofc system can be expressed as follows  41   sofc systems can run on fuels other than pure hydrogen gas  however  since hydrogen is necessary for the reactions listed above  the fuel selected must contain hydrogen atoms  for the fuel cell to operate  the fuel must be converted into pure hydrogen gas  sofcs are capable of internally reforming light hydrocarbons such as methane  natural gas   42  propane and butane  43  these fuel cells are at an early stage of development  44   challenges exist in sofc systems due to their high operating temperatures  one such challenge is the potential for carbon dust to build up on the anode  which slows down the internal reforming process  research to address this  carbon coking  issue at the university of pennsylvania has shown that the use of copper-based cermet  heat-resistant materials made of ceramic and metal  can reduce coking and the loss of performance  45  another disadvantage of sofc systems is slow start-up time  making sofcs less useful for mobile applications  despite these disadvantages  a high operating temperature provides an advantage by removing the need for a precious metal catalyst like platinum  thereby reducing cost  additionally  waste heat from sofc systems may be captured and reused  increasing the theoretical overall efficiency to as high as 80%\u201385%.[39   the high operating temperature is largely due to the physical properties of the ysz electrolyte  as temperature decreases  so does the ionic conductivity of ysz  therefore  to obtain optimum performance of the fuel cell  a high operating temperature is required  according to their website  ceres power  a uk sofc fuel cell manufacturer  has developed a method of reducing the operating temperature of their sofc system to 500\u2013600 degrees celsius  they replaced the commonly used ysz electrolyte with a cgo  cerium gadolinium oxide  electrolyte  the lower operating temperature allows them to use stainless steel instead of ceramic as the cell substrate  which reduces cost and start-up time of the system  46   molten carbonate fuel cells  mcfcs  require a high operating temperature  650\xa0\xb0c (1,200\xa0\xb0f   similar to sofcs  mcfcs use lithium potassium carbonate salt as an electrolyte  and this salt liquefies at high temperatures  allowing for the movement of charge within the cell \u2013 in this case  negative carbonate ions  47   like sofcs  mcfcs are capable of converting fossil fuel to a hydrogen-rich gas in the anode  eliminating the need to produce hydrogen externally  the reforming process creates co2 emissions  mcfc-compatible fuels include natural gas  biogas and gas produced from coal  the hydrogen in the gas reacts with carbonate ions from the electrolyte to produce water  carbon dioxide  electrons and small amounts of other chemicals  the electrons travel through an external circuit creating electricity and return to the cathode  there  oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide recycled from the anode react with the electrons to form carbonate ions that replenish the electrolyte  completing the circuit  47  the chemical reactions for an mcfc system can be expressed as follows  48   as with sofcs  mcfc disadvantages include slow start-up times because of their high operating temperature  this makes mcfc systems not suitable for mobile applications  and this technology will most likely be used for stationary fuel cell purposes  the main challenge of mcfc technology is the cells  short life span  the high-temperature and carbonate electrolyte lead to corrosion of the anode and cathode  these factors accelerate the degradation of mcfc components  decreasing the durability and cell life  researchers are addressing this problem by exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that may increase cell life without decreasing performance  39   mcfcs hold several advantages over other fuel cell technologies  including their resistance to impurities  they are not prone to  carbon coking   which refers to carbon build-up on the anode that results in reduced performance by slowing down the internal fuel reforming process  therefore  carbon-rich fuels like gases made from coal are compatible with the system  the department of energy claims that coal  itself  might even be a fuel option in the future  assuming the system can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal into hydrogen  39  mcfcs also have relatively high efficiencies  they can reach a fuel-to-electricity efficiency of 50   considerably higher than the 37\u201342  efficiency of a phosphoric acid fuel cell plant  efficiencies can be as high as 65  when the fuel cell is paired with a turbine  and 85  if heat is captured and used in a combined heat and power  chp  system  47   fuelcell energy  a connecticut-based fuel cell manufacturer  develops and sells mcfc fuel cells  the company says that their mcfc products range from 300\xa0kw to 2.8\xa0mw systems that achieve 47  electrical efficiency and can utilize chp technology to obtain higher overall efficiencies  one product  the dfc-erg  is combined with a gas turbine and  according to the company  it achieves an electrical efficiency of 65%.[49   glossary of terms in table   for more information see glossary of fuel cell terms  the energy efficiency of a system or device that converts energy is measured by the ratio of the amount of useful energy put out by the system   output energy   to the total amount of energy that is put in   input energy   or by useful output energy as a percentage of the total input energy  in the case of fuel cells  useful output energy is measured in electrical energy produced by the system  input energy is the energy stored in the fuel  according to the u s  department of energy  fuel cells are generally between 40\u201360  energy efficient  57  this is higher than some other systems for energy generation  for example  the typical internal combustion engine of a car is about 25  energy efficient  58  in combined heat and power  chp  systems  the heat produced by the fuel cell is captured and put to use  increasing the efficiency of the system to up to 85\u201390%.[39   the theoretical maximum efficiency of any type of power generation system is never reached in practice  and it does not consider other steps in power generation  such as production  transportation and storage of fuel and conversion of the electricity into mechanical power  however  this calculation allows the comparison of different types of power generation  the maximum theoretical energy efficiency of a fuel cell is 83   operating at low power density and using pure hydrogen and oxygen as reactants  assuming no heat recapture  59  according to the world energy council  this compares with a maximum theoretical efficiency of 58  for internal combustion engines  59  while these efficiencies are not approached in most real world applications  high-temperature fuel cells  solid oxide fuel cells or molten carbonate fuel cells  can theoretically be combined with gas turbines to allow stationary fuel cells to come closer to the theoretical limit  a gas turbine would capture heat from the fuel cell and turn it into mechanical energy to increase the fuel cell s operational efficiency  this solution has been predicted to increase total efficiency to as much as 80%.[60   in a fuel-cell vehicle the tank-to-wheel efficiency is greater than 45  at low loads 61  and shows average values of about 36  when a driving cycle like the nedc  new european driving cycle  is used as test procedure  62  the comparable nedc value for a diesel vehicle is 22   in 2008 honda released a demonstration fuel cell electric vehicle  the honda fcx clarity  with fuel stack claiming a 60  tank-to-wheel efficiency  63   it is also important to take losses due to fuel production  transportation  and storage into account  fuel cell vehicles running on compressed hydrogen may have a power-plant-to-wheel efficiency of 22  if the hydrogen is stored as high-pressure gas  and 17  if it is stored as liquid hydrogen  64  fuel cells cannot store energy like a battery  65  except as hydrogen  but in some applications  such as stand-alone power plants based on discontinuous sources such as solar or wind power  they are combined with electrolyzers and storage systems to form an energy storage system  most hydrogen  however  is produced by steam methane reforming  and so most hydrogen production emits carbon dioxide  66  the overall efficiency  electricity to hydrogen and back to electricity  of such plants  known as round-trip efficiency   using pure hydrogen and pure oxygen can be  from 35 up to 50 percent   depending on gas density and other conditions  67  while a much cheaper lead u2013acid battery might return about 90   the electrolyzer fuel cell system can store indefinite quantities of hydrogen  and is therefore better suited for long-term storage   solid-oxide fuel cells produce heat from the recombination of the oxygen and hydrogen  the ceramic can run as hot as 800 degrees celsius  this heat can be captured and used to heat water in a micro combined heat and power  m-chp  application  when the heat is captured  total efficiency can reach 80\u201390  at the unit  but does not consider production and distribution losses  chp units are being developed today for the european home market   professor jeremy p  meyers  in the electrochemical society journal interface in 2008  wrote   while fuel cells are efficient relative to combustion engines  they are not as efficient as batteries  due primarily to the inefficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction  and     the oxygen evolution reaction  should the hydrogen be formed by electrolysis of water       t hey make the most sense for operation disconnected from the grid  or when fuel can be provided continuously  for applications that require frequent and relatively rapid start-ups     where zero emissions are a requirement  as in enclosed spaces such as warehouses  and where hydrogen is considered an acceptable reactant  a  pem fuel cell  is becoming an increasingly attractive choice  if exchanging batteries is inconvenient    68  in 2013 military organisations are evaluating fuel cells to significantly reduce the battery weight carried by soldiers  69   stationary fuel cells are used for commercial  industrial and residential primary and backup power generation  fuel cells are very useful as power sources in remote locations  such as spacecraft  remote weather stations  large parks  communications centers  rural locations including research stations  and in certain military applications  a fuel cell system running on hydrogen can be compact and lightweight  and have no major moving parts  because fuel cells have no moving parts and do not involve combustion  in ideal conditions they can achieve up to 99.9999  reliability  70  this equates to less than one minute of downtime in a six-year period  70   since fuel cell electrolyzer systems do not store fuel in themselves  but rather rely on external storage units  they can be successfully applied in large-scale energy storage  rural areas being one example  71  there are many different types of stationary fuel cells so efficiencies vary  but most are between 40  and 60  energy efficient  39  however  when the fuel cell s waste heat is used to heat a building in a cogeneration system this efficiency can increase to 85%.[39  this is significantly more efficient than traditional coal power plants  which are only about one third energy efficient  72  assuming production at scale  fuel cells could save 20\u201340  on energy costs when used in cogeneration systems  73  fuel cells are also much cleaner than traditional power generation  a fuel cell power plant using natural gas as a hydrogen source would create less than one ounce of pollution  other than co2  for every 1,000\xa0kw xb7h produced  compared to 25 pounds of pollutants generated by conventional combustion systems  74  fuel cells also produce 97  less nitrogen oxide emissions than conventional coal-fired power plants   one such pilot program is operating on stuart island in washington state  there the stuart island energy initiative 75  has built a complete  closed-loop system  solar panels power an electrolyzer  which makes hydrogen  the hydrogen is stored in a 500-u s -gallon (1,900\xa0l  tank at 200 pounds per square inch (1,400\xa0kpa   and runs a relion fuel cell to provide full electric back-up to the off-the-grid residence  another closed system loop was unveiled in late 2011 in hempstead  ny  76   fuel cells can be used with low-quality gas from landfills or waste-water treatment plants to generate power and lower methane emissions  a 2.8 mw fuel cell plant in california is said to be the largest of the type  77   combined heat and power  chp  fuel cell systems  including micro combined heat and power  microchp  systems are used to generate both electricity and heat for homes  see home fuel cell   office building and factories  the system generates constant electric power  selling excess power back to the grid when it is not consumed   and at the same time produces hot air and water from the waste heat  as the result chp systems have the potential to save primary energy as they can make use of waste heat which is generally rejected by thermal energy conversion systems  78  a typical capacity range of home fuel cell is 1\u20133\xa0kwel   4\u20138\xa0kwth  79][80  chp systems linked to absorption chillers use their waste heat for refrigeration  81   the waste heat from fuel cells can be diverted during the summer directly into the ground providing further cooling while the waste heat during winter can be pumped directly into the building  the university of minnesota owns the patent rights to this type of system 82][83   co-generation systems can reach 85  efficiency (40\u201360  electric   remainder as thermal   39  phosphoric-acid fuel cells  pafc  comprise the largest segment of existing chp products worldwide and can provide combined efficiencies close to 90%.[84][85  molten carbonate  mcfc  and solid oxide fuel cells  sofc  are also used for combined heat and power generation and have electrical energy efficiences around 60%.[86  disadvantages of co-generation systems include slow ramping up and down rates  high cost and short lifetime  87][88  also their need to have a hot water storage tank to smooth out the thermal heat production was a serious disadvantage in the domestic market place where space in domestic properties is at a great premium  89   delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64  of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012.[69  the japanese ene farm project will pass 100,000 fc mchp systems in 2014  34.213 pemfc and 2.224 sofc were installed in the period 2012-2014  30,000 units on lng and 6,000 on lpg  90   as of 2015  two fuel cell vehicles have been introduced for commercial lease and sale in limited quantities  the toyota mirai and the hyundai ix35 fcev  additional demonstration models include the honda fcx clarity  and mercedes-benz f-cell  91  as of june 2011 demonstration fcevs had driven more than 4,800,000\xa0km (3,000,000\xa0mi   with more than 27,000 refuelings  92  demonstration fuel cell vehicles have been produced with  a driving range of more than 400\xa0km (250\xa0mi  between refueling   93  they can be refueled in less than 5 minutes  94  the u s  department of energy s fuel cell technology program claims that  as of 2011  fuel cells achieved 53\u201359  efficiency at one-quarter power and 42\u201353  vehicle efficiency at full power  95  and a durability of over 120,000\xa0km (75,000\xa0mi  with less than 10  degradation  93  in a well-to-wheels simulation analysis that  did not address the economics and market constraints   general motors and its partners estimated that per mile traveled  a fuel cell electric vehicle running on compressed gaseous hydrogen produced from natural gas could use about 40  less energy and emit 45  less greenhouse gasses than an internal combustion vehicle  96  a lead engineer from the department of energy whose team is testing fuel cell cars said in 2011 that the potential appeal is that  these are full-function vehicles with no limitations on range or refueling rate so they are a direct replacement for any vehicle  for instance  if you drive a full sized suv and pull a boat up into the mountains  you can do that with this technology and you can t with current battery-only vehicles  which are more geared toward city driving   97   in 2014  toyota introduced its first fuel cell vehicle in japan  the mirai  at a price of less than us 100,000,[98  although former european parliament president pat cox estimates that toyota will initially lose about $100,000 on each mirai sold  99  hyundai introduced the limited production hyundai ix35 fcev  100  other manufacturers that have announced intentions to sell fuel cell electric vehicles commercially by 2016 include general motors  101  honda  102  mercedes-benz  103  and nissan  104   some experts believe that hydrogen fuel cell cars will never become economically competitive with other technologies 105][106][107][108  or that it will take decades for them to become profitable  68][109  elon musk stated in 2015 that fuel cells for use in cars will never be commercially viable because of the inefficiency of producing  transporting and storing hydrogen and the flammability of the gas  among other reasons  105  professor jeremy p  meyers estimated in 2008 that cost reductions over a production ramp-up period will take about 20 years after fuel-cell cars are introduced before they will be able to compete commercially with current market technologies  including gasoline internal combustion engines  68  in 2011  the chairman and ceo of general motors  daniel akerson  stated that while the cost of hydrogen fuel cell cars is decreasing   the car is still too expensive and probably won t be practical until the 2020-plus period  i don t know   110   in 2012  lux research  inc  issued a report that stated   the dream of a hydrogen economy     is no nearer   it concluded that  capital cost     will limit adoption to a mere 5.9 gw  by 2030  providing  a nearly insurmountable barrier to adoption  except in niche applications   the analysis concluded that  by 2030  pem stationary market will reach $1 billion  while the vehicle market  including forklifts  will reach a total of $2 billion  109  other analyses cite the lack of an extensive hydrogen infrastructure in the u s  as an ongoing challenge to fuel cell electric vehicle commercialization  in 2006  a study for the ieee showed that for hydrogen produced via electrolysis of water   only about 25  of the power generated from wind  water  or sun is converted to practical use   the study further noted that  electricity obtained from hydrogen fuel cells appears to be four times as expensive as electricity drawn from the electrical transmission grid      because of the high energy losses  hydrogen  cannot compete with electricity   111  furthermore  the study found   natural gas reforming is not a sustainable solution   111   the large amount of energy required to isolate hydrogen from natural compounds  water  natural gas  biomass   package the light gas by compression or liquefaction  transfer the energy carrier to the user  plus the energy lost when it is converted to useful electricity with fuel cells  leaves around 25  for practical use   61][68][112   joseph romm  the author of the hype about hydrogen (2005   devoted two articles in 2014 to updating his critique of the use of fuel cells in cars  he stated that fcvs still had not overcome the following issues  high cost of the vehicles  high fueling cost  and a lack of fuel-delivery infrastructure   it would take several miracles to overcome all of those problems simultaneously in the coming decades   113  most importantly  he said   fcvs aren t green  because of escaping methane during natural gas extraction and when hydrogen is produced  as 95  of it is  using the steam reforming process  he concluded that renewable energy cannot economically be used to make hydrogen for an fcv fleet  either now or in the future   106  greentech media s analyst reached similar conclusions in 2014.[114  in 2015  clean technica listed some of the disadvantages of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles  115  so did car throttle  116  another clean technica writer concluded   while hydrogen may have a part to play in the world of energy storage  especially seasonal storage   it looks like a dead end when it comes to mainstream vehicles   117   as of august 2011
