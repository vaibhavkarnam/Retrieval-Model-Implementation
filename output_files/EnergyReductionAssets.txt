EnergyReductionAssets
  nthe reduction of expected energy use is a potential revenue source that may be manipulated to improve business performance and reduce waste and environmental impacts  in 2011  the world economic forum reported that personal  digital data is a new asset class  generating a new wave of opportunity for economic and societal value creation  1  due to dramatic advances in web-based monitoring  real-time data analytics and utilities using peak pricing  energy reduction is now becoming a tangible asset that companies can measure  manage  procure and sell  for energy reduction  capturing data is the means to tap into energy savings  which  over time  become an asset  in order to implement efficiency measures and generate revenue streams  it is important to determine areas of least efficiency  this will provide the platform for accurately focusing efforts to achieve the greatest returns on investment  2  energy reduction assets  eras  are revenue streams that are created by tracking the unspent portion of traditional energy usage  clarification needed       there are two ways to generate an energy reduction asset  through an energy efficiency project or by participating in a demand response program  energy efficiency results in long-term savings  while demand response programs produce immediate earnings revenue streams   energy efficiency projects have proven to be valuable to organizations in cost savings  as well as in reducing the carbon footprint  conservation and other positive environmental impacts  energy efficiency measures include building control upgrades  updating hvac  lighting and mechanical systems that use less energy per unit of service they provide  essentially  these measures aim to reduce the amount of energy needed to supply a particular service  which means less energy is used and less money is spent  companies consumers can use the money saved over time through energy efficiency  as assets to sell and invest in the market   demand response programs are similar to energy efficiency projects  however  they result in immediate short-term energy reduction  along with immediate earnings from the energy saved  demand response is the process of curtailing an energy load  load shedding  during peak energy demand hours  historically  demand response has played a vital role in emergency situations that create an imbalance on the energy grid  resulting in power outages and extreme costs  in recent years however  the market for demand response has been transforming into a demand management system whereby automated energy management systems  known as automated demand response  and market developments make it possible for companies to earn money for modifying their electricity usage year-round  3   these \u201cearnings u201d are the eras generated through reduced energy usage during peak demand hours  in essence  the market for demand response stems from the end users ability to \u201csell u201d the energy not used when they curtail usage u2014at the same prices as real megawatts of generated electricity  this process of selling a theoretical unit of power u2014the negawatt u2014that represents the amount of energy saved during a demand response program  when the electricity provider does not have to provide x amount of megawatts to their customer  then that customer essentially gets paid for that as if they sold it to someone else in the market  thus  revenue streams are generated through this process of curtailing an energy load at peak demand hours   utilizing new technologies to gather data and implement energy efficiency measures is key to generating eras  the environmental and economic benefits of reducing energy usage are becoming increasingly apparent throughout the country  energy service companies  escos  have grown the market for energy efficiency from $500 million in 1990 to over $5 billion in 2011  according to the lawrence berkeley national laboratory  revenues will continue to increase u2014doubling or even tripling to $15.3 billion by the end of the decade  4  these growing revenues are a significant representation of the improving energy efficiency market  however  energy efficiency remains critically underutilized in the nation u2019s energy portfolio  it is time to take advantage of the data and programs available to capture the savings that energy efficiency offers  5
