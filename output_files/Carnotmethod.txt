Carnotmethod
 the carnot method is an allocation procedure for dividing up fuel input  primary energy  end energy  in joint production processes that generate two or more energy products in one process  e g  cogeneration or trigeneration   it is also suited to allocate other streams such as co2-emissions or variable costs  the potential to generate mechanical or electrical work  exergy  is used as the distribution key  for heat this potential can be assessed the carnot efficiency  thus  the carnot method is a form of an exergetic allocation method  it uses mean heat grid temperatures at the output of the process as a calculation basis  the main application area of this method is cogeneration  but it can also be applied to other processes generating a joint products  such as a chiller generating cold and producing waste heat which could be used for low temperature heat demand  the carnot method s advantage is that no external reference values are required to allocate the input to the different output streams  only endogenous process parameters are needed  thus  the allocation results remain unbiased of assumptions or external reference values that are open for discussion       the fuel share ael which is needed to generate the combined product electrical energy w  work  and ath for the thermal energy h  useful heat  respectively  can be calculated accordingly to the first and

 exergy declines  exergy does not only consider energy but also energy quality  it can be considered a product of both  therefore any energy transformation should also be assessed according to its exergetic efficiciency or loss ratios  the quality of the product  thermal energy  is fundamentally determined by the mean temperature level at which this heat is delivered  hence  the exergetic
