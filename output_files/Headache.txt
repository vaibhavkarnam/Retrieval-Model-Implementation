Headache
 headache is the symptom of pain anywhere in the region of the head or neck  it occurs in migraines  tension-type headaches  and cluster headaches  1  frequent headaches can affect relationships and employment  1  there is also an increased risk of depression in those with severe headaches  1   headaches can occur as a result of many conditions whether serious or not  there are a number of different classification systems for headaches  the most well-recognized is that of the international headache society  causes of headaches may include fatigue  sleep deprivation  stress  the effects of medications  the effects of recreational drugs  viral infections  loud noises  common colds  head injury  rapid ingestion of a very cold food or beverage  and dental or sinus issues   treatment of a headache depends on the underlying cause  but commonly involves pain medication  some form of headache is one of the most commonly experienced of all physical discomforts   about half of adults have a headache in a given year  1  tension headaches are the most common affecting about 1.6\xa0billion people (21.8  of the population  followed by migraine headaches which affect about 848 million (11.7%).[2   there are more than two hundred types of headaches  some are harmless and some are life-threatening  the description of the headache and findings on neurological examination  determine whether additional tests are needed and what treatment is best  3   headaches are broadly classified as  primary  or "secondary   4  primary headaches are benign  recurrent headaches not caused by underlying disease or structural problems  for example  migraine is a type of primary headache  while primary headaches may cause significant daily pain and disability  they are not dangerous  secondary headaches are caused by an underlying disease  like an infection  head injury  vascular disorders  brain bleed or tumors  secondary headaches can be harmless or dangerous  certain  red flags  or warning signs indicate a secondary headache may be dangerous  5   90  of all headaches are primary headaches  primary headaches usually first start when people are between 20 and 40 years old .[6  the most common types of primary headaches are migraines and tension-type headaches  6  they have different characteristics  migraines typically present with pulsing head pain  nausea  photophobia  sensitivity to light  and phonophobia  sensitivity to sound   tension-type headaches usually present with non-pulsing  bandlike  pressure on both sides of the head  not accompanied by other symptoms  7  other very rare types of primary headaches include  5   headaches may be caused by problems elsewhere in the head or neck  some of these are not harmful  such as cervicogenic headache  pain arising from the neck muscles   medication overuse headache may occur in those using excessive painkillers for headaches  paradoxically causing worsening headaches  3   more serious causes of secondary headaches include  5   the brain itself is not sensitive to pain  because it lacks pain receptors  however  several areas of the head and neck do have pain receptors and can thus sense pain  these include the extracranial arteries  middle meningeal artery  large veins  venous sinuses  cranial and spinal nerves  head and neck muscles  the meninges  falx cerebri  parts of the brainstem  eyes  ears  teeth and lining of the mouth  8][9  pial arteries  rather than pial veins are responsible for pain production  5   headaches often result from traction to or irritation of the meninges and blood vessels  the nociceptors may be stimulated by head trauma or tumors and cause headaches  blood vessel spasms  dilated blood vessels  inflammation or infection of meninges and muscular tension can also stimulate nociceptors and cause pain  9  once stimulated  a nociceptor sends a message up the length of the nerve fiber to the nerve cells in the brain  signaling that a part of the body hurts   primary headaches are more difficult to understand than secondary headaches  the exact mechanisms which cause migraines  tension headaches and cluster headaches are not known  there have been different theories over time which attempt to explain what happens in the brain to cause these headaches   migraines are currently thought to be caused by dysfunction of the nerves in the brain  10  previously  migraines were thought to be caused by a primary problem with the blood vessels in the brain  11  this vascular theory  which was developed in the 20th century by wolff  suggested that the aura in migraines is caused by constriction of intracranial vessels  vessels inside the brain   and the headache itself is caused by rebound dilation of extracranial vessels  vessels just outside the brain   dilation of these extracranial blood vessels activates the pain receptors in the surrounding nerves  causing a headache  the vascular theory is no longer accepted  10][12  studies have shown migraine head pain is not accompanied by extracranial vasodilation  but rather only has some mild intracranial vasodilation  13   currently  most specialists think migraines are due to a primary problem with the nerves in the brain  10  auras are thought to be caused by a wave of increased activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex  a part of the brain  known as cortical spreading depression 14  followed by a period of depressed activity  15  some people think headaches are caused by the activation of sensory nerves which release peptides  such as serotonin  causing inflammation in arteries  dura and meninges and also cause some vasodilation  triptans  medications which treat migraines  block serotonin receptors and constrict blood vessels  16   people who are more susceptible to experience migraines without headache are those who have a family history of migraines  women  and women who are experiencing hormonal changes or are taking birth control pills or are prescribed hormone replacement therapy  17   tension headaches are thought to be caused by activation of peripheral nerves in the head and neck muscles [18   cluster headaches involve overactivation of the trigeminal nerve and hypothalamus in the brain  but the exact cause is unknown  19   most headaches can be diagnosed by the clinical history alone  5  if the symptoms described by the person sound dangerous  further testing with neuroimaging and or lumbar puncture may be necessary  electroencephalography  eeg  is not useful for headache diagnosis  21   the first step to diagnosing a headache is to determine if the headache is old or new  22  a  new headache  can be a headache that has started recently  or a chronic headache that has changed character  22  for example  if a person has chronic weekly headaches with pressure on both sides of his head  and then develops a sudden severe throbbing headache on one side of his head  he has a new headache   it can be challenging to differentiate between low-risk  benign headaches and high-risk  dangerous headaches since symptoms are often similar  23  headaches that are possibly dangerous require further lab tests and imaging to diagnose   the american college for emergency physicians published criteria for low-risk headaches  they are as follows  24   a number of characteristics make it more likely that the headache is due to potentially dangerous secondary causes which may be life-threatening or cause long-term damage  these  red flag  symptoms means that a headache warrants further investigation with neuroimaging and lab tests  6   in general  people complaining of their  first  or  worst  headache warrant imaging and further workup  6  people with progressively worsening headache also warrant imaging  as they may have a mass or a bleed that is gradually growing  pressing on surrounding structures and causing worsening pain  23  people with neurological findings on exam  such as weakness  also need further workup  23   the american headache society recommends using  ssnoop   a mnemonic to remember the red flags for identifying a secondary headache  22   other red flag symptoms include  6][22][23][25   old headaches are usually primary headaches and are not dangerous  they are most often caused by migraines or tension headaches  migraines are often unilateral  pulsing headaches accompanied by nausea and or vomiting  there may be an aura  visual symptoms  numbness or tingling  30\u201360 minutes before the headache  warning the person of a headache  migraines may also not have auras  25  tension type headaches usually have bilateral  bandlike  pressure on both sides of the head usually without nausea or vomiting  however  some symptoms from both headache groups may overlap  it is important to distinguish between the two because the treatments are different  25   the mnemonic  pound  helps distinguish between migraines and tension type headaches  pound stands for pulsatile quality  4\u201372 hours in length  unilateral location  nausea or vomiting  disabling intensity  7  one review article found that if 4\u20135 of the pound characteristics are present  migraine is 24 times as likely a diagnosis than tension type headache  likelihood ratio 24   if 3 characteristics of pound are present  migraine is 3 times more likely a diagnosis than tension type headache  likelihood ratio 3).[7  if only 2 pound characteristics are present  tension type headaches are 60  more likely  likelihood ratio 0.41   another study found the following factors independently each increase the chance of migraine over tension type headache  nausea  photophobia  phonophobia  exacerbation by physical activity  unilateral  throbbing quality  chocolate as headache trigger  cheese as headache trigger  26   cluster headaches are relatively rare (1\u20133 in 10,000 people  and are more common in men than women  they present with sudden onset explosive pain around one eye and are accompanied by autonomic symptoms  tearing  runny nose and red eye   5   temporomandibular jaw pain  chronic pain in the jaw joint   and cervicogenic headache  headache caused by pain in muscles of the neck  are also possible diagnoses  22   for chronic  unexplained headaches  keeping a headache diary can be useful for tracking symptoms and identifying triggers  such as association with menstrual cycle  exercise and food  the national migraine center has free headache diaries to download at their website  27  while mobile electronic diaries for smartphones are becoming increasingly common  a recent review found most are developed with a lack of evidence base and scientific expertise  28   new headaches are more likely to be dangerous secondary headaches  they can  however  simply be the first presentation of a chronic headache syndrome  like migraine or tension-type headaches   one recommended diagnostic approach is as follows  29  if any urgent red flags are present such as visual loss  new seizures  new weakness  new confusion  further workup with imaging and possibly a lumbar puncture should be done  see red flags section for more details   if the headache is sudden onset  thunderclap headache   a computed tomography test to look for a brain bleed  subarachnoid hemorrhage  should be done  if the ct scan does not show a bleed  a lumbar puncture should be done to look for blood in the csf  as the ct scan can be falsely negative and subarachnoid hemorrhages can be fatal  if there are signs of infection such as fever  rash  or stiff neck  a lumbar puncture to look for meningitis should be considered  if there is jaw claudication and scalp tenderness in an older person  a temporal artery biopsy to look for temporal arteritis should be performed and immediate treatment should be started   the us headache consortium has guidelines for neuroimaging of non-acute headaches  30  most old  chronic headaches do not require neuroimaging  if a person has the characteristic symptoms of a migraine  neuroimaging is not needed as it is very unlikely the person has an intracranial abnormality  31  if the person has neurological findings  such as weakness  on exam  neuroimaging may be considered   all people who present with red flags indicating a dangerous secondary headache should receive neuroimaging  25  the best form of neuroimaging for these headaches is controversial  6  non-contrast computerized tomography  ct  scan is usually the first step in head imaging as it is readily available in emergency departments and hospitals and is cheaper than mri  non-contrast ct is best for identifying an acute head bleed  magnetic resonance imaging  mri  is best for brain tumors and problems in the posterior fossa  or back of the brain  6  mri is more sensitive for identifying intracranial problems  however it can pick up brain abnormalities that are not relevant to the person s headaches  6   the american college of radiology recommends the following imaging tests for different specific situations  32   a lumbar puncture is a procedure in which cerebral spinal fluid is removed from the spine with a needle  a lumbar puncture is necessary to look for infection or blood in the spinal fluid  a lumbar puncture can also evaluate the pressure in the spinal column  which can be useful for people with idiopathic intracranial hypertension  usually young  obese women who have increased intracranial pressure   or other causes of increased intracranial pressure  in most cases  a ct scan should be done first  5   headaches are most thoroughly classified by the international headache society s international classification of headache disorders  ichd   which published the second edition in 2004.[33  the third edition of the international headache classification was published in 2013 in a beta version ahead of the final version  34  this classification is accepted by the who  35   other classification systems exist  one of the first published attempts was in 1951.[36  the us national institutes of health developed a classification system in 1962.[37   the international classification of headache disorders  ichd  is an in-depth hierarchical classification of headaches published by the international headache society  it contains explicit  operational  diagnostic criteria for headache disorders  the first version of the classification  ichd-1  was published in 1988  the current revision  ichd-2  was published in 2004.[38   the classification uses numeric codes  the top  one-digit diagnostic level includes 14 headache groups  the first four of these are classified as primary headaches  groups 5-12 as secondary headaches  cranial neuralgia  central and primary facial pain and other headaches for the last two groups  39   the ichd-2 classification defines migraines  tension-types headaches  cluster headache and other trigeminal autonomic headache as the main types of primary headaches  33  also  according to the same classification  stabbing headaches and headaches due to cough  exertion and sexual activity  sexual headache  are classified as primary headaches  the daily-persistent headaches along with the hypnic headache and thunderclap headaches are considered primary headaches as well   secondary headaches are classified based on their etiology and not on their symptoms  33  according to the ichd-2 classification  the main types of secondary headaches include those that are due to head or neck trauma such as whiplash injury  intracranial hematoma  post craniotomy or other head or neck injury  headaches caused by cranial or cervical vascular disorders such as ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack  non-traumatic intracranial hemorrhage  vascular malformations or arteritis are also defined as secondary headaches  this type of headaches may also be caused by cerebral venous thrombosis or different intracranial vascular disorders  other secondary headaches are those due to intracranial disorders that are not vascular such as low or high pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid pressure  non-infectious inflammatory disease  intracranial neoplasm  epileptic seizure or other types of disorders or diseases that are intracranial but that are not associated with the vasculature of the central nervous system  ichd-2 classifies headaches that are caused by the ingestion of a certain substance or by its withdrawal as secondary headaches as well  this type of headache may result from the overuse of some medications or by exposure to some substances  hiv aids  intracranial infections and systemic infections may also cause secondary headaches  the ichd-2 system of classification includes the headaches associated with homeostasis disorders in the category of secondary headaches  this means that headaches caused by dialysis  high blood pressure  hypothyroidism  and cephalalgia and even fasting are considered secondary headaches  secondary headaches  according to the same classification system  can also be due to the injury of any of the facial structures including teeth  jaws  or temporomandibular joint  headaches caused by psychiatric disorders such as somatization or psychotic disorders are also classified as secondary headaches   the ichd-2 classification puts cranial neuralgias and other types of neuralgia in a different category  according to this system  there are 19 types of neuralgias and headaches due to different central causes of facial pain  moreover  the ichd-2 includes a category that contains all the headaches that cannot be classified   although the ichd-2 is the most complete headache classification there is and it includes frequency in the diagnostic criteria of some types of headaches  primarily primary headaches   it does not specifically code frequency or severity which are left at the discretion of the examiner  33   the nih classification consists of brief definitions of a limited number of headaches  40   the nih system of classification is more succinct and only describes five categories of headaches  in this case  primary headaches are those that do not show organic or structural etiology  according to this classification  headaches can only be vascular  myogenic  cervicogenic  traction and inflammatory   primary headache syndromes have many different possible treatments  in those with chronic headaches the long term use of opioids appears to result in greater harm than benefit  41   migraine can be somewhat improved by lifestyle changes  but most people require medicines to control their symptoms  5  medications are either to prevent getting migraines  or to reduce symptoms once a migraine starts   preventive medications are generally recommended when people have more than four attacks of migraine per month  headaches last longer than 12 hours or the headaches are very disabling  5][42  possible therapies include beta blockers  antidepressants  anticonvulsants and nsaids  42  the type of preventive medicine is usually chosen based on the other symptoms the person has  for example  if the person also has depression  an antidepressant is a good choice   abortive therapies for migraines may be oral  if the migraine is mild to moderate  or may require stronger medicine given intravenously or intramuscularly  mild to moderate headaches should first be treated with nsaids  like ibuprofen  and or acetaminophen  if accompanied by nausea or vomiting  an antiemitic such as metoclopramide  reglan  can be given orally or rectally  moderate to severe attacks should be treated first with an oral triptan  a medication which mimics serotonin  an agonist  and causes mild vasoconstriction  if accompanied by nausea and vomiting  parenteral  through a needle in the skin  triptans and antiemetics can be given   several complementary and alternative strategies can help with migraines  the american academy of neurology guidelines for migraine treatment in 2000 stated relaxation training  electromyographic feedback and cognitive behavioral therapy may be considered for migraine treatment  along with medications  43   tension-type headaches can usually be managed with nsaids  ibuprofen  naproxen   acetaminophen or aspirin  5  triptans are not helpful in tension-type headaches unless the person also has migraines  for chronic tension type headaches  amitriptyline is the only medication proven to help  5][44][45  amitriptyline is a medication which treats depression and also independently treats pain  it works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine  and also reduces muscle tenderness by a separate mechanism  44  studies evaluating acupuncture for tension-type headaches have been mixed  46][47][48][49][50  overall  they show that acupuncture is probably not helpful for tension-type headaches   abortive therapy for cluster headaches includes subcutaneous sumatriptan  injected under the skin  and triptan nasal sprays  high flow oxygen therapy also helps with relief  5   for people with extended periods of cluster headaches  preventive therapy can be necessary  verapamil is recommended as first line treatment  lithium can also be useful  for people with shorter bouts  a short course of prednisone (10 days  can be helpful  ergotamine is useful if given 1\u20132 hours before an attack  5  see cluster headaches for more detailed information   treatment of secondary headaches involves treating the underlying cause  for example  a person with meningitis will require antibiotics  a person with a brain tumor may require surgery  chemotherapy and or brain radiation   peripheral neuromodulation has tentative benefits in primary headaches including cluster headaches and chronic migraine  51  how it may work is still being looked into  51   approximately 64\u201377  of people have a headache at some point in their lives  during each year  on average  46\u201353  of people have headaches  52][53  most of these headaches are not dangerous  only approximately 1\u20135  of people who seek emergency treatment for headaches have a serious underlying cause  54   more than 90  of headaches are primary headaches  55  most of these primary headaches are tension headaches  53  most people with tension headaches have  episodic  tension headaches that come and go  only 3.3  of adults have chronic tension headaches  with headaches for more than 15 days in a month  53   approximately 12\u201318  of people in the world have migraines  53  more women than men experience migraines  in europe and north america  5\u20139  of men experience migraines  while 12\u201325  of women experience migraines  52   cluster headaches are very rare  they affect only 1\u20133 per thousand people in the world  cluster headaches affect approximately three times as many men as women  53   the first recorded classification system was published by aretaeus of cappadocia  a medical scholar of greco-roman antiquity  he made a distinction between three different types of headache  i  cephalalgia  by which he indicates a shortlasting  mild headache  ii  cephalea  referring to a chronic type of headache  and iii  heterocrania  a paroxysmal headache on one side of the head  another classification system that resembles the modern ones was published by thomas willis  in de cephalalgia in 1672  in 1787 christian baur generally divided headaches into idiopathic  primary headaches  and symptomatic  secondary ones   and defined 84 categories  40   in general  children suffer from the same types of headaches as adults do  but their symptoms may be slightly different  the diagnostic approach to headache in children is similar to that of adults  however  young children may not be able to verbalize pain well  56  if a young child is fussy  they may have a headache  57   approximately 1  of emergency department visits for children are for headache  58][59  most of these headaches are not dangerous  the most common type of headache seen in pediatric emergency rooms is headache caused by a cold (28.5    other headaches diagnosed in the emergency department include post-traumatic headache (20    headache related to a problem with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt  a device put into the brain to remove excess csf and reduce pressure in the brain  (11.5   and migraine (8.5%).[59][60  the most common serious headaches found in children include brain bleeds  subdural hematoma  epidural hematoma   brain abscesses  meningitis and ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction  only 4\u20136.9  of kids with a headache have a serious cause  57   just as in adults  most headaches are benign  but when head pain is accompanied with other symptoms such as speech problems  muscle weakness  and loss of vision  a more serious underlying cause may exist  hydrocephalus  meningitis  encephalitis  abscess  hemorrhage  tumor  blood clots  or head trauma  in these cases  the headache evaluation may include ct scan or mri in order to look for possible structural disorders of the central nervous system  61  if a child with a recurrent headache has a normal physical exam  neuroimaging is not recommended  guidelines state children with abnormal neurologic exams  confusion  seizures and recent onset of worst headache of life  change in headache type or anything suggesting neurologic problems should receive neuroimaging  57   when children complain of headaches  many parents are concerned about a brain tumor  generally  headaches caused by brain masses are incapacitating and accompanied by vomiting  57  one study found characteristics associated with brain tumor in children are  headache for greater than 6 months  headache related to sleep  vomiting  confusion  no visual symptoms  no family history of migraine and abnormal neurologic exam  62   some measures can help prevent headaches in children  drinking plenty of water throughout the day  avoiding caffeine  getting enough and regular sleep  eating balanced meals at the proper times  and reducing stress and excess of activities may prevent headaches  63  treatments for children are similar to those for adults  however certain medications such as narcotics should not be given to children  57   children who have headaches will not necessarily have headaches as adults  in one study of 100 children with headache  eight years later 44  of those with tension headache and 28  of those with migraines were headache free  64  in another study of people with chronic daily headache  75  did not have chronic daily headaches two years later  and 88  did not have chronic daily headaches eight years later  65
