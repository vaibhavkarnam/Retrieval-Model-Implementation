Biochar
 biochar is charcoal used as a soil amendment  biochar is a stable solid  rich in carbon  and can endure in soil for thousands of years  1  like most charcoal  biochar is made from biomass via pyrolysis  biochar is under investigation as an approach to carbon sequestration  1  biochar thus has the potential to help mitigate climate change via carbon sequestration  2][3  independently  biochar can increase soil fertility of acidic soils  low ph soils   increase agricultural productivity  and provide protection against some foliar and soil-borne diseases  4  its potential benefits have at times been oversold  5       pre-columbian amazonians are believed to have used biochar to enhance soil productivity  they seem to have produced it by smoldering agricultural waste  i e   covering burning biomass with soil  6  in pits or trenches  7  european settlers called it terra preta de indio  8  following observations and experiments  a research team working in french guiana hypothesized that the amazonian earthworm pontoscolex corethrurus was the main agent of fine powdering and incorporation of charcoal debris to the mineral soil  9   the term \u201cbiochar u201d was coined by peter read to describe charcoal used as a soil improvement  10   biochar is a high-carbon  fine-grained residue that today is produced through modern pyrolysis processes  it is the direct thermal decomposition of biomass in the absence of oxygen  preventing combustion   which produces a mixture of solids  the biochar proper   liquid  bio-oil   and gas  syngas  products  the specific yield from the pyrolysis is dependent on process conditions  such as temperature  and can be optimized to produce either energy or biochar  11  temperatures of 400\u2013500\xa0\xb0c (752\u2013932\xa0\xb0f  produce more char  while temperatures above 700\xa0\xb0c (1,292\xa0\xb0f  favor the yield of liquid and gas fuel components  12  pyrolysis occurs more quickly at the higher temperatures  typically requiring seconds instead of hours  high temperature pyrolysis is also known as gasification  and produces primarily syngas  which has been used as vehicle fuel in some times and places  12  typical yields are 60  bio-oil  20  biochar  and 20  syngas  by comparison  slow pyrolysis can produce substantially more char (~50    it is this which contributes to the observed soil fertility of terra preta  once initialized  both processes produce net energy  for typical inputs  the energy required to run a \u201cfast u201d pyrolyzer is approximately 15  of the energy that it outputs  13  modern pyrolysis plants can use the syngas created by the pyrolysis process and output 3\u20139 times the amount of energy required to run  7   the amazonian pit trench method 7  harvests neither bio-oil nor syngas  and releases a large amount of co2  black carbon  and other greenhouse gases  ghg s  and potentially  toxins  into the air  commercial-scale systems process agricultural waste  paper byproducts  and even municipal waste and typically eliminate these side effects by capturing and using the liquid and gas products  the production of biochar as an output is not a priority in most cases   in a centralized system  all biomass in a region is brought to a central plant for processing  alternatively  each farmer or group of farmers can operate a lower-tech kiln  finally  a truck equipped with a pyrolyzer can move from place to place to pyrolyze biomass  vehicle power comes from the syngas stream  while the biochar remains on the farm  the biofuel is sent to a refinery or storage site  factors that influence the choice of system type include the cost of transportation of the liquid and solid byproducts  the amount of material to be processed  and the ability to feed directly into the power grid   for crops that are not exclusively for biochar production  the residue-to-product ratio  rpr  and the collection factor  cf  the percent of the residue not used for other things  measure the approximate amount of feedstock that can be obtained for pyrolysis after harvesting the primary product  for instance  brazil harvests approximately 460 million tons  mt  of sugarcane annually  14  with an rpr of 0.30  and a cf of 0.70 for the sugarcane tops  which normally are burned in the field  15  this translates into approximately 100 mt of residue annually  which could be pyrolyzed to create energy and soil additives  adding in the bagasse  sugarcane waste  (rpr 0.29 cf 1.0   which is otherwise burned  inefficiently  in boilers  raises the total to 230 mt of pyrolysis feedstock  some plant residue  however  must remain on the soil to avoid increased costs and emissions from nitrogen fertilizers  16   pyrolysis technologies for processing loose and leafy biomass produce both biochar and syngas  17   alternatively   thermo-catalytic depolymerization   which utilizes microwaves  has recently been used to efficiently convert organic matter to biochar on an industrial scale  producing ~50  char  18][19   the burning and natural decomposition of biomass and in particular agricultural waste adds large amounts of co n2 to the atmosphere  biochar that is stable  fixed  and  recalcitrant  carbon can store large amounts of greenhouse gases in the ground for centuries  potentially reducing or stalling the growth in atmospheric greenhouse gas levels  at the same time its presence in the earth can improve water quality  increase soil fertility  raise agricultural productivity  and reduce pressure on old-growth forests  20   biochar can sequester carbon in the soil for hundreds to thousands of years  like coal  21][22][23][24][25  such a carbon-negative technology would lead to a net withdrawal of co2 from the atmosphere  while producing and consuming energy  this technique is advocated by prominent scientists such as james hansen  head of the nasa goddard institute for space studies  26  and james lovelock  creator of the gaia hypothesis  for mitigation of global warming by greenhouse gas remediation  27   researchers have estimated that sustainable use of biocharring could reduce the global net emissions of carbon dioxide (co n2   methane  and nitrous oxide by up to 1.8\u2009pg co n2-c equivalent (co n2-ce  per year (12  of current anthropogenic co n2-ce emissions  1\u2009pg 1\u2009gt   and total net emissions over the course of the next century by 130\u2009pg co n2-ce  without endangering food security  habitat  or soil conservation  28   biochar is recognised as offering a number of benefits for soil health  many benefits are related to the extremely porous nature of biochar  this structure is found to be very effective at retaining both water and water-soluble nutrients  soil biologist elaine ingham indicates 29  the extreme suitability of biochar as a habitat for many beneficial soil micro organisms  she points out that when pre charged with these beneficial organisms biochar becomes an extremely effective soil amendment promoting good soil  and in turn plant  health   biochar has also been shown to reduce leaching of e-coli through sandy soils depending on application rate  feedstock  pyrolysis temperature  soil moisture content  soil texture  and surface properties of the bacteria  30][31][32   for plants that require high potash and elevated ph  33  biochar can be used as a soil amendment to improve yield   biochar can improve water quality  reduce soil emissions of greenhouse gases  reduce nutrient leaching  reduce soil acidity  and reduce irrigation and fertilizer requirements  34  biochar was also found under certain circumstances to induce plant systemic responses to foliar fungal diseases and to improve plant responses to diseases caused by soilborne pathogens  35][36][37   the various impacts of biochar can be dependent on the properties of the biochar  38  as well as the amount applied  37  and there is still a lack of knowledge about the important mechanisms and properties  39  biochar impact may depend on regional conditions including soil type  soil condition  depleted or healthy   temperature  and humidity  40  modest additions of biochar to soil reduce nitrous oxide n n2o emissions by up to 80  and eliminate methane emissions  which are both more potent greenhouse gases than co2.[41   studies have reported positive effects from biochar on crop production in degraded and nutrient u2013poor soils  42  biochar can be designed with specific qualities to target distinct properties of soils  43  in an columbian savanna soil  biochar reduced leaching of critical nutrients  created a higher crop uptake of nutrients  and provided greater soil availability of nutrients  44  at 10  levels biochar reduced contaminant levels in plants by up to 80   while reducing total chlordane and ddx content in the plants by 68 and 79   respectively  45  on the other hand  because of its high adsorption capacity  biochar may reduce the efficacy of soil applied pesticides that are needed for weed and pest control  46][47  high-surface-area biochars may be particularly problematic in this regard  more research into the long-term effects of biochar addition to soil is needed  46   switching from slash-and-burn to slash-and-char farming techniques in brazil can decrease both deforestation of the amazon basin and carbon dioxide emission  as well as increase crop yields  slash-and-burn leaves only 3  of the carbon from the organic material in the soil  48   slash-and-char can keep up to 50  of the carbon in a highly stable form  49  returning the biochar into the soil rather than removing it all for energy production reduces the need for nitrogen fertilizers  thereby reducing cost and emissions from fertilizer production and transport  50  additionally  by improving the soil s ability to be tilled  fertility  and productivity  biochar u2013enhanced soils can indefinitely sustain agricultural production  whereas non-enriched soils quickly become depleted of nutrients  forcing farmers to abandon the fields  producing a continuous slash and burn cycle and the continued loss of tropical rainforest  using pyrolysis to produce bio-energy also has the added benefit of not requiring infrastructure changes the way processing biomass for cellulosic ethanol does  additionally  the biochar produced can be applied by the currently used machinery for tilling the soil or equipment used to apply fertilizer  51   biochar is a desirable soil material in many locations due to its ability to attract and retain water  this is possible because of its porous structure and high surface area  52  as a result  nutrients  phosphorus  and agrochemicals are retained for the plants benefit  plants are therefore healthier  and less fertilizer leaches into surface or groundwater   mobile pyrolysis units can be used to lower the costs of transportation of the biomass if the biochar is returned to the soil and the syngas stream is used to power the process  53][54  bio-oil contains organic acids that are corrosive to steel containers  has a high water vapor content that is detrimental to ignition  and  unless carefully cleaned  contains some biochar particles which can block injectors  55  currently  it is less suitable for use as a kind of biodiesel than other sources   if biochar is used for the production of energy rather than as a soil amendment  it can be directly substituted for any application that uses coal  pyrolysis also may be the most cost-effective way of electricity generation from biomaterial  56   intensive research into manifold aspects involving the pyrolysis biochar platform is underway around the world  from 2005 to 2012  there were 1,038 articles that included the word \u201cbiochar u201d or \u201cbio-char u201d in the topic that had been indexed in the isi web of science  58  further research is in progress by such diverse institutions around the world as cornell university  the university of edinburgh  which has a dedicated research unit   59  the agricultural research organization  aro  of israel  volcani center  where a network of researchers involved in biochar research  ibrn  israel biochar researchers network  was established as early as 2009  and the university of delaware   students at stevens institute of technology in new jersey are developing supercapacitors that use electrodes made of biochar  60  a process developed by university of florida researchers that removes phosphate from water  also yields methane gas usable as fuel and phosphate-laden carbon suitable for enriching soil  61   if biomass is burned to biochar and put back into the soil  rather than being completely burned  this may reduce carbon emissions  potentially  the bioenergy industry might even be made to sequester net carbon  62  pyrolysis might be cost-effective for a combination of sequestration and energy production when the cost of a co n2 ton reaches $37.[62  as of mid-february 2010  co n2 was trading at $16.82 ton on the european climate exchange  ecx   so using pyrolysis for bioenergy production may be feasible even if it is more expensive than fossil fuel  this awaits the development of carbon trading credits for biochar  not available as of 2011.[63   current biochar projects make no significant impact on the overall global carbon budget  although expansion of this technique has been advocated as a geoengineering approach  64  in may 2009  the biochar fund received a grant from the congo basin forest fund for a project in central africa to simultaneously slow down deforestation  increase the food security of rural communities  provide renewable energy and sequester carbon  though some farmers did report better maize crops  the project ended early without significant results and with promises to the farmers not kept  65   application rates of 2.5\u201320 tonnes per hectare (1.0\u20138.1\xa0t acre  appear to be required to produce significant improvements in plant yields  biochar costs in developed countries vary from $300\u20137000 tonne  generally too high for the farmer horticulturalist and prohibitive for low-input field crops  in developing countries  constraints on agricultural biochar relate more to biomass availability and production time  an alternative is to use small amounts of biochar in lower cost biochar-fertilizer complexes  66   various companies in north america  australia  and england sell biochar or biochar production units  citation needed  in sweden the  stockholm solution  is an urban tree planting system that uses 30  biochar to support healthy growth of the urban forest  the qatar aspire park now uses biochar to help trees cope with the intense heat of their summers   at the 2009 international biochar conference  a mobile pyrolysis unit with a specified intake of 1,000 pounds (450\xa0kg  was introduced for agricultural applications  the unit had a length of 12 feet and height of 7 feet (3.6 m by 2.1m   67   a production unit in dunlap  tennessee by mantria corporation opened in august 2009 after testing and an initial run  was later shut down as part of a ponzi scheme investigation  68
