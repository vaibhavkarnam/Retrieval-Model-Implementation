Gasoline
 gasoline /\u02c8\u0261\xe6s u0259li u02d0n   known as petrol /\u02c8p u025btr u0259l  outside north america  is a transparent  petroleum-derived liquid that is used primarily as a fuel in internal combustion engines  it consists mostly of organic compounds obtained by the fractional distillation of petroleum  enhanced with a variety of additives   on average  a 42-gallon barrel of crude oil (159 l  yields about 19 us gallons (72\xa0l  of gasoline when processed in an oil refinery  though this varies based on the crude oil source s assay   the characteristic of a particular gasoline blend to resist igniting too early  which causes knocking and reduces efficiency in reciprocating engines  is measured by its octane rating  gasoline is produced in several grades of octane rating  tetraethyllead and other lead compounds are no longer used in most areas to regulate and increase octane-rating  but many other additives are put into gasoline to improve its chemical stability  control corrosiveness and provide fuel system  cleaning   and determine performance characteristics under intended use  sometimes  gasoline also contains ethanol as an alternative fuel  for economic or environmental reasons   gasoline  as used worldwide in the vast number of internal combustion engines used in transport and industry  has a significant impact on the environment  both in local effects  e g   smog  and in global effects  e g   effect on the climate   gasoline may also enter the environment uncombusted  as liquid and as vapors  from leakage and handling during production  transport and delivery  from storage tanks  from spills  etc  as an example of efforts to control such leakage  many  underground  storage tanks are required to have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent such leaks  citation needed  gasoline contains benzene and other known carcinogens  1][better xa0source xa0needed  gasoline inhalation can produce an intense high  however the practice is thought to cause severe organ damage  including mental retardation  2][3][4       the first automotive combustion engines  so-called otto engines  were developed in the last quarter of the 19th century in germany  the fuel was a relatively volatile hydrocarbon obtained from coal gas  with a boiling point near 85\xa0\xb0c  octanes boil about 40\xa0\xb0c higher   it was well suited for early carburetors  evaporators   the development of a  spray nozzle  carburetor enabled the use of less volatile fuels  further improvements in engine efficiency were attempted at higher compression ratios  but early attempts were blocked by knocking  premature explosion of fuel   in the 1920s  antiknock compounds were introduced by thomas midgley jr  and boyd  specifically tetraethyllead  tel   this innovation started a cycle of improvements in fuel efficiency that coincided with the large-scale development of oil refining to provide more products in the boiling range of gasoline  in the 1950s oil refineries started to focus on high octane fuels  and then detergents were added to gasoline to clean the jets in carburetors  the 1970s witnessed greater attention to the environmental consequences of burning gasoline  these considerations led to the phasing out of tel and its replacement by other antiknock compounds  subsequently  low-sulfur gasoline was introduced  in part to preserve the catalysts in modern exhaust systems  5    gasoline  is the term that is used in north america to refer to the most popular automobile fuel  the oxford english dictionary dates the first use to 1863  when it was spelled  gasolene   it was never a trademark  although it may have been derived from older trademarks such as  cazeline  and "gazeline   6  variant spellings of  gasoline  had been used to refer to raw petroleum since the 16th century  6    petrol  is the preferred term in most commonwealth countries   petrol  was first used as the name of a refined petroleum product around 1870 by british wholesaler carless  capel  amp  leonard  who marketed it as a solvent  7  when the product later found a new use as a motor fuel  frederick simms  an associate of gottlieb daimler  suggested to carless that they register the trade mark "petrol   8  but by this time the word was already in general use  possibly inspired by the french p xe9trole  6  and the registration was not allowed  carless registered a number of alternative names for the product  but  petrol  became the common term for the fuel in the british commonwealth  9][10   british refiners originally used  motor spirit  as a generic name for the automotive fuel  when carless was denied a trademark on  petrol  in the 1930s  its competitors also adopted the more popular name  however   motor spirit  had already made its way into laws and regulations  so the term remains in use as a formal name for petrol  11][12  the term is used most widely in nigeria  where the largest petroleum companies call their product  premium motor spirit   13  although  petrol  has made inroads into nigerian english   premium motor spirit  remains the formal name that is used in scientific publications  government reports  and newspapers  14   the use of the word gasoline instead of petrol outside north america can often be confusing  shortening gasoline to gas  which happens often  causes confusion with various forms of gas used as car fuel  compressed natural gas  cng   liquefied natural gas  lng  and liquefied petroleum gas  lpg    in many countries  gasoline has a colloquial name derived from that of the chemical benzene  e g   german benzin  czech benz xedn  dutch benzine  italian benzina  russian \u0431\u0435\u043d u0437\u0438\u043d benzin  polish benzyna  chilean spanish bencina  thai \u0e40\u0e1a

and paraguay use the colloquial name nafta derived from that of the chemical naphtha  15   spark ignition engines are designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration  however  the unburned mixture may autoignite by detonating from pressure and heat alone  rather than ignite from the spark plug at exactly the right time  this causes a rapid pressure rise which can damage the engine  this is often referred to as engine knocking or end-gas knock  knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline s resistance to autoignition  which is expressed by its octane rating   octane rating is measured relative to a mixture of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane  an isomer of octane  and n-heptane  there are different conventions for expressing octane ratings  so the same physical fuel may have several different octane ratings based on the measure used  one of the best known is the research octane number  ron    the octane rating of typical commercially available gasoline varies by country  in finland  sweden  and norway  95 ron is the standard for regular unleaded gasoline and 98 ron is also available as a more expensive option  in the uk  ordinary regular unleaded gasoline is 95 ron  commonly available   premium unleaded gasoline is always 97 ron  and super unleaded is usually 97\u201398 ron  citation needed  however  both shell and bp produce fuel at 102 ron for cars with high-performance engines and in 2006 the supermarket chain tesco began to sell super unleaded gasoline rated at 99 ron  in the us  octane ratings in unleaded fuels can vary between 85[16  and 87 aki (91\u201392 ron  for regular  through 89\u201390 aki (94\u201395 ron  for mid-grade  equivalent to european regular   up to 90\u201394 aki (95\u201399 ron  for premium  european premium    south africa s largest city  johannesburg  is located on the highveld at 1,753 metres (5,751\xa0ft  above sea level  so the south african aa recommends 95 octane gasoline  petrol  at low altitude and 93 octane for use in johannesburg because  the higher the altitude the lower the air pressure  and the lower the need for a high octane fuel as there is no real performance gain   17   the octane rating became important as the military sought higher output for aircraft engines in the late 1930s and the 1940s  a higher octane rating allows a higher compression ratio or supercharger boost  and thus higher temperatures and pressures  which translate to higher power output  some scientists even predicted that a nation with a good supply of high octane gasoline would have the advantage in air power  in 1943  the rolls-royce merlin aero engine produced 1,320 horsepower (984\xa0kw  using 100 ron fuel from a modest 27 liter displacement  by the time of operation overlord during world war ii both the raf and usaaf were conducting some operations in europe using 150 ron fuel (100/150 avgas   obtained by adding 2.5  aniline to 100 octane avgas  18  by this time the rolls-royce merlin 66 was developing 2,000\xa0hp using this fuel   quality gasoline should be stable for six months if stored properly but gasoline will break down slowly over time due to the separation of the components  gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble but the effects of long term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever-increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up  if left undiluted  improper operation will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring and or the lack of proper action of the fuel within a fuel injection system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate  if applicable to the vehicle   storage should be in an airtight container  to prevent oxidation or water vapors mixing in with the gas  that can withstand the vapor pressure of the gasoline without venting  to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions  at a stable cool temperature  to reduce the excess pressure from liquid expansion  and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions   when gasoline is not stored correctly  gums and solids may be created  which can corrode system components and accumulate on wetted surfaces  resulting in a condition called  stale fuel   gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture  then forming gums  solids  or two phases  a hydrocarbon phase floating on top of a water-alcohol phase    the presence of these degradation products in the fuel tank  fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components makes it harder to start the engine or causes reduced engine performance  on resumption of regular engine use  the buildup may or may not be eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline  the addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle  some typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing mineral spirits  isopropyl alcohol  1,2,4-trimethylbenzene  or other additives  fuel stabilizer is commonly used for small engines  such as lawnmower and tractor engines  especially when their use is seasonal  low to no use for one or more seasons of the year   users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure  to avoid storage at high temperatures  to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage  and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor  5   gasoline stability requirements are set in standard astm d4814-14b  the standard describes the various characteristics and requirements of automotive fuels for use over a wide range of operating conditions in ground vehicles equipped with spark-ignition engines   energy is obtained from the combustion of gasoline by the conversion of a hydrocarbon to carbon dioxide and water  the combustion of octane follows this reaction   gasoline contains about 46.7 mj kg (127 mj us gal  35.3 kwh us gal  13.0 kwh kg  120,405 btu us gal  quoting the lower heating value  [19  gasoline blends differ  and therefore actual energy content varies according to the season and producer by up to 1.75  more or less than the average  20  on average  about 74 l of gasoline (19.5 us gal  16.3 imp gal  are available from a barrel of crude oil  about 46  by volume   varying due to quality of crude and grade of gasoline  the remainder are products ranging from tar to naphtha  21   a high-octane-rated fuel  such as liquefied petroleum gas  lpg  has an overall lower power output at the typical 10:1 compression ratio of a gasoline engine  however  with an engine tuned to the use of lpg  i e  via higher compression ratios  such as 12:1 instead of 10:1   the power output can be improved  this is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking  resulting in a higher cylinder temperature  which improves efficiency  also  increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke  which is by far the greater effect  the higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process  an atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages  chiefly detonation  of a high compression ratio  a high expansion ratio is also one of the two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines  along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow   the lower energy content  per liter  of lpg in comparison to gasoline is due mainly to its lower density  energy content per kilogram is higher than for gasoline  higher hydrogen to carbon ratio  for an example see standard enthalpy of formation    molecular weights of the above reagents are c8h18 114  o2 32  co2 44  h2o 18  therefore 1\xa0kg of fuel reacts with 3.51\xa0kg of oxygen to produce 3.09\xa0kg of carbon dioxide and 1.42\xa0kg of water   the density of gasoline ranges from 0.71\u20130.77\xa0kg l (719.7 kg m3\xa0  0.026 lb in3  6.073\xa0lb us gal  7.29\xa0lb imp gal   higher densities having a greater volume of aromatics  22  since gasoline floats on water  water cannot generally be used to extinguish a gasoline fire unless used in a fine mist  finished marketable gasoline is traded with a standard reference of 0.755\xa0kg

of crude oil  material separated from crude oil via distillation  called virgin or straight-run gasoline  does not meet specifications for modern engines  particularly the octane rating  see below   but can be pooled to the gasoline blend   the bulk of a typical gasoline consists of hydrocarbons with between 4 and 12 carbon atoms per molecule  commonly referred to as c4-c12).[5  it is a mixture of paraffins  alkanes   cycloalkanes  naphthenes   and olefins  alkenes   where the usage of the terms paraffin and olefin is particular to the oil industry  the actual ratio depends on   the various refinery streams blended to make gasoline have different characteristics  some important streams are   the terms above are the jargon used in the oil industry and terminology varies   currently  many countries set limits on gasoline aromatics in general  benzene in particular  and olefin  alkene  content  such regulations led to increasing preference for high octane pure paraffin  alkane  components  such as alkylate  and is forcing refineries to add processing units to reduce benzene content  in the eu the benzene limit is set at 1  volume for all grade of automotive gasoline   gasoline can also contain other organic compounds  such as organic ethers  deliberately added   plus small levels of contaminants  in particular organosulfur compounds  but these are usually removed at the refinery   almost all countries in the world have phased out automotive leaded fuel  in 2011 six countries 23  were still using leaded gasoline  afghanistan  myanmar  north korea  algeria  iraq and yemen  it was expected that by the end of 2013 those countries would ban leaded gasoline  24  but it has not occurred  algeria will replace leaded with unleaded automotive fuel only in 2015  clarification needed  different additives have replaced the lead compounds  the most popular additives include aromatic hydrocarbons  ethers and alcohol  usually ethanol or methanol   for technical reasons the use of leaded additives is still permitted worldwide for the formulation of some grades of aviation gasoline such as 100ll  because the required octane rating would be technically infeasible to reach without the use of leaded additives   gasoline  when used in high-compression internal combustion engines  tends to autoignite  detonate  causing damaging  engine knocking   also called  pinging  or  pinking    to address this problem  tetraethyllead  tel  was widely adopted as an additive for gasoline in the 1920s  with the discovery of the extent of environmental and health damage caused by the lead  however  and the incompatibility of lead with catalytic converters  leaded gasoline was phased out in the usa beginning in 1973  by 1995  leaded fuel accounted for only 0.6  of total gasoline sales and under 2000 short tons (1814 t  of lead per year in the usa  from 1 january 1996  the u s  clean air act banned the sale of leaded fuel for use in on-road vehicles in the usa  the use of tel also necessitated other additives  such as dibromoethane  first european countries started replacing lead by the end of the 1980s and by the end of the 1990s leaded gasoline was banned within the entire european union  reduction in the average blood lead level is believed to have been a major cause for falling violent crime rates in the united states 25  and south africa  26  a statistically significant correlation has been found between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime  taking into account a 22-year time lag  the violent crime curve virtually tracks the lead exposure curve  27][28   lead replacement petrol  lrp  was developed for vehicles designed to run on leaded fuel and incompatible with unleaded  rather than tetraethyl lead it contains other metal such as potassium compounds or methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl  mmt   these are purported to buffer soft exhaust valves and seats so that they do not suffer recession due to the use of unleaded fuel   lrp was marketed during and after the phaseout of leaded motor fuels in the united kingdom  australia  south africa and some other countries vague   consumer confusion led to widespread mistaken preference for lrp rather than unleaded  29  and lrp was phased out 8 to 10 years after the introduction of unleaded  30   leaded petrol was withdrawn from sale in britain after 31 december 1999  seven years after eec regulations signalled the end of production for cars using leaded petrol in member states  at this stage  a large percentage of cars from the 1980s and early 1990s which ran on leaded petrol were still in use  along with cars which could run on unleaded fuel  including later versions of the 1981-1990 volkswagen polo mk2   however  the declining number of such cars on british roads saw many petrol stations withdrawing lrp from sale by 2003.[31   methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl  mmt  is used in canada and in australia to boost octane  32  it also helps old cars designed for leaded fuel run on unleaded fuel without need for additives to prevent valve problems  citation needed  its use in the us has been restricted by regulations  33  its use in the eu is restricted by article 8a of the fuel quality directive 34  following its testing under the protocol for the evaluation of effects of metallic fuel-additives on the emissions performance of vehicles  35   gummy  sticky resin deposits result from oxidative degradation of gasoline upon long term storage  these harmful deposits arise from the oxidation of alkenes and other minor components in gasoline  see drying oils   improvements in refinery techniques have generally reduced the susceptibility of gasolines to these problems  previously  catalytically or thermally cracked gasolines are most susceptible to oxidation  the formation of these gums is accelerated by copper salts  which can be neutralized by additives called metal deactivators   this degradation can be prevented through the addition of 5\u2013100 ppm of antioxidants  such as phenylenediamines and other amines  5  hydrocarbons with a bromine number of 10 or above can be protected with the combination of unhindered or partially hindered phenols and oil-soluble strong amine bases  such as hindered phenols   stale  gasoline can be detected by a colorimetric enzymatic test for organic peroxides produced by oxidation of the gasoline  36   gasolines are also treated with metal deactivators  which are compounds that sequester  deactivate  metal salts that otherwise accelerate the formation of gummy residues  the metal impurities might arise from the engine itself or as contaminants in the fuel   gasoline  as delivered at the pump  also contains additives to reduce internal engine carbon buildups  improve combustion  and to allow easier starting in cold climates  high levels of detergent can be found in top tier detergent gasolines  the specification for top tier detergent gasolines was developed by four automakers  gm  honda  toyota and bmw  according to the bulletin  the minimal epa requirement is not sufficient to keep engines clean  37  typical detergents include alkylamines and alkyl phosphates at the level of 50\u2013100 ppm  5   in the eu  5  ethanol can be added within the common gasoline spec  en 228   discussions are ongoing to allow 10  blending of ethanol  available in finnish  french and german gas stations   in finland most gasoline stations sell 95e10  which is 10  of ethanol  and 98e5  which is 5  ethanol  most gasoline sold in sweden has 5\u201315  ethanol added   in brazil  the brazilian national agency of petroleum  natural gas and biofuels  anp  requires gasoline for automobile use to have 27.5  of ethanol added to its composition  38  pure hydrated ethanol is also available as a fuel   legislation requires retailers to label fuels containing ethanol on the dispenser  and limits ethanol use to 10  of gasoline in australia  such gasoline is commonly called e10 by major brands  and it is cheaper than regular unleaded gasoline   the federal renewable fuel standard  rfs  effectively requires refiners and blenders to blend renewable biofuels  mostly ethanol  with gasoline  sufficient to meet a growing annual target of total gallons blended  although the mandate does not require a specific percentage of ethanol  annual increases in the target combined with declining gasoline consumption has caused the typical ethanol content in gasoline to approach 10   most fuel pumps display a sticker that states that the fuel may contain up to 10  ethanol  an intentional disparity that reflects the varying actual percentage  until late 2010  fuels retailers were only authorized to sell fuel containing up to 10 percent ethanol (e10   and most vehicle warranties  except for flexible fuel vehicles  authorize fuels that contain no more than 10 percent ethanol  citation needed  in parts of the united states  ethanol is sometimes added to gasoline without an indication that it is a component   the government of india in october 2007 decided to make 5  ethanol blending  with petrol  mandatory  currently  10  ethanol

gasoline  ron 91  is dyed a light shade of red orange and the medium grade  ron 95  is dyed yellow  42   in the united states  aviation gasoline  avgas  is dyed to identify its octane rating and to distinguish it from kerosene-based jet fuel  which is clear  43   in canada the gasoline for marine and farm use is dyed red and is not subject to road tax citation needed    oxygenate blending adds oxygen-bearing compounds such as mtbe  etbe  ethanol  and biobutanol  the presence of these oxygenates reduces the amount of carbon monoxide and unburned fuel in the exhaust gas  in many areas throughout the us  oxygenate blending is mandated by epa regulations to reduce smog and other airborne pollutants  for example  in southern california  fuel must contain 2  oxygen by weight  resulting in a mixture of 5.6  ethanol in gasoline  the resulting fuel is often known as reformulated gasoline  rfg  or oxygenated gasoline  or in the case of california  california reformulated gasoline  the federal requirement that rfg contain oxygen was dropped on 6 may 2006 because the industry had developed voc-controlled rfg that did not need additional oxygen  44   mtbe was phased out in the us due to ground water contamination and the resulting regulations and lawsuits  ethanol and  to a lesser extent  the ethanol-derived etbe are common replacements  a common ethanol-gasoline mix of 10  ethanol mixed with gasoline is called gasohol or e10  and an ethanol-gasoline mix of 85  ethanol mixed with gasoline is called e85  the most extensive use of ethanol takes place in brazil  where the ethanol is derived from sugarcane  in 2004  over 3.4 billion us gallons (2.8\xa0billion imp xa0gal 13 million m xb3  of ethanol was produced in the united states for fuel use  mostly from corn  and e85 is slowly becoming available in much of the united states  though many of the relatively few stations vending e85 are not open to the general public  45  the use of bioethanol  either directly or indirectly by conversion of such ethanol to bio-etbe  is encouraged by the european union directive on the promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport  since producing bioethanol from fermented sugars and starches involves distillation  though  ordinary people in much of europe cannot legally ferment and distill their own bioethanol at present  unlike in the us  where getting a batf distillation permit has been easy since the 1973 oil crisis    combustion of 1 u s  gallon (3.8\xa0l  of gasoline produces 8.74 kilograms (19.3\xa0lb  of carbon dioxide (2.3\xa0kg

people can be exposed to gasoline in the workplace by swallowing it  breathing in vapors  skin contact  and eye contact  the national institute for occupational safety and health  niosh  has designated gasoline as a carcinogen  51   inhaled  huffed  gasoline vapor is a common intoxicant that has become epidemic in some poorer communities and indigenous groups in australia  canada  new

53   like other hydrocarbons  gasoline burns in a limited range of its vapor phase and  coupled with its volatility  this makes leaks highly dangerous when sources of ignition are present  gasoline has a lower explosive limit of 1.4  by volume and an upper explosive limit of 7.6   if the concentration is below 1.4   the air-gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite  if the concentration is above 7.6   the mixture is too rich and also does not ignite  however  gasoline vapor rapidly mixes and spreads with air  making unconstrained gasoline quickly flammable   the united states

combustion are considered  then about 18.95 pounds of co2 are produced when a gallon of e10 is combusted  47  about 12.73 pounds of co2 are produced when a gallon of pure ethanol is combusted  47   biodiesel fuel is sold with various amounts of biodiesel content  b20 is a commonly sold biodiesel fuel  b20 contains 20  biodiesel and 80  petroleum diesel fuel  burning a gallon of b20 results in the emission of about 17.90 pounds of co2 that is emitted from the fossil fuel content  if the emissions from burning the biodiesel in b20 are included  then about 22.06 pounds of co2 are produced  about 20.77 pounds of co2 are produced from burning a gallon of b100 (100  biodiesel   47   volumetric and mass energy density of some fuels compared with gasoline  in the rows with gross and net
