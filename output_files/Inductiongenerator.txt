Inductiongenerator
 an induction generator or asynchronous generator is a type of alternating current  ac  electrical generator that uses the principles of induction motors to produce power  induction generators operate by mechanically turning their rotors faster than synchronous speed  a regular ac asynchronous motor usually can be used as a generator  without any internal modifications  induction generators are useful in applications such as mini hydro power plants  wind turbines  or in reducing high-pressure gas streams to lower pressure  because they can recover energy with relatively simple controls   an induction generator usually draws its excitation power from an electrical grid  sometimes  however  they are self-excited by using phase-correcting capacitors  because of this  induction generators cannot usually  black start  a de-energized distribution system       an induction generator produces electrical power when its rotor is turned faster than the synchronous speed  for a typical four-pole motor  two pairs of poles on stator  operating on a 60\xa0hz electrical grid  the synchronous speed is 1800 rotations per minute  rpm   the same four-pole motor operating on a 50\xa0hz grid will have a synchronous speed of 1500\xa0rpm  the motor normally turns slightly slower than the synchronous speed  the difference between synchronous and operating speed is called  slip  and is usually expressed as per cent of the synchronous speed  for example  a motor operating at 1450\xa0rpm that has a synchronous speed of 1500\xa0rpm is running at a slip of +3.3    in normal motor operation  the stator flux rotation is faster than the rotor rotation  this causes the stator flux to induce rotor currents  which create a rotor flux with magnetic polarity opposite to stator  in this way  the rotor is dragged along behind stator flux  with the currents in the rotor induced at the slip frequency   in generator operation  a prime mover  turbine or engine  drives the rotor above the synchronous speed  negative slip   the stator flux still induces currents in the rotor  but since the opposing rotor flux is now cutting the stator coils  an active current is produced in stator coils and the motor now operates as a generator  sending power back to the electrical grid   an induction machine requires externally supplied armature current  because the rotor field always lags behind the stator field  the induction machine always  consumes  reactive power  regardless of whether it is operating as a generator or a motor   a source of excitation current for magnetizing flux  reactive power  for the stator is still required  to induce rotor current  this can be supplied from the electrical grid or  once it starts producing power  from the generator itself   an induction machine can be started by charging the capacitors  with a dc source  while the generator is turning typically at or above generating speeds  once the dc source is removed the capacitors will provide the magnetization current required to begin producing voltage   an induction machine that has recently been operating may also spontaneously produce voltage and current due to residual magnetism left in the core   active power delivered to the line is proportional to slip above the synchronous speed  full rated power of the generator is reached at very small slip values  motor dependent  typically 3    at synchronous speed of 1800\xa0rpm  generator will produce no power  when the driving speed is increased to 1860\xa0rpm  typical example   full output power is produced  if the prime mover is unable to produce enough power to fully drive the generator  speed will remain somewhere between 1800 and 1860 rpm range   a capacitor bank must supply reactive power to the motor when used in stand-alone mode  the reactive power supplied should be equal or greater than the reactive power that the machine normally draws when operating as a motor   the basic fundamental of induction generators is the conversion between mechanical energy to electrical energy  this requires an external torque applied to the rotor to turn it faster than the synchronous speed  however  indefinitely increasing torque doesn t lead to an indefinite increase in power generation  the rotating magnetic field torque excited from the armature works to counter the motion of the rotor and prevent over speed because of induced motion in the opposite direction  as the speed of the motor increases the counter torque reaches a max value of torque  breakdown torque  that it can operate until before the operating conditions become unstable  ideally  induction generators work best in the stable region between the no-load condition and maximum torque region   in practice and without taking this notion into account  many users unsuccessfully apply these principles to the actual deployment  in almost every case  under the same active grid voltage  the power that the generator produces is greater than the power it consumes when it is at the motor  fully loaded state  its rated power  sometimes the differences are in multiple folds  a higher power will lead to a higher amperage   for prolonged operation  and implied in its guarantee  each motor has a \u201cmaximum pass-through current u201d  this amperage value  the current density  is derived from the maximum pass-through current property of the internal copper magnet wire and the combined configuration of their connections  without opening up the unit to examine the internal setting of the copper wires  a division of the wattage of its rated power by its rated voltage can give users some senses of its value   therefore  claims of making a unit generate more power than it s rated should be more closely examined   in induction generators  the reactive power required to establish the air gap magnetic flux is provided by a capacitor bank connected to the machine in case of stand-alone system and in case of grid connection it draws reactive power from the grid to maintain its air gap flux  for a grid-connected system  frequency and voltage at the machine will be dictated by the electric grid  since it is very small compared to the whole system  for stand-alone systems  frequency and voltage are complex function of machine parameters  capacitance used for excitation  and load value and type   an induction generator connected to a capacitor system can generate sufficient reactive power to operate on its own  when the load current exceeds the capability of the generator to supply both magnetization reactive power  and load power the generator will immediately cease to produce power  the load must be removed and the induction generator restarted with either a dc source  or if present  residual magnetism in the core   induction generators are often used in wind turbines and some micro hydro installations due to their ability to produce useful power at varying rotor speeds  induction generators are mechanically and electrically simpler than other generator types  they are also more rugged  requiring no brushes or commutators   induction generators are particularly suitable for wind generating stations as in this case speed is always a variable factor  unlike synchronous motors  induction generators are load-dependent and cannot be used alone for grid frequency control   as an example  consider the use of a 10\xa0hp  1760\xa0r min  440\xa0v  three-phase induction motor as an asynchronous generator  the full-load current of the motor is 10\xa0a and the full-load power factor is 0.8   required capacitance per phase if capacitors are connected in delta   for a machine to run as an asynchronous generator  capacitor bank must supply minimum 4567   3 phases   1523 var per phase  voltage per capacitor is 440\xa0v because capacitors are connected in delta   minimum capacitance per phase   if the load also absorbs reactive power  capacitor bank must be increased in size to compensate   prime mover speed should be used to generate frequency of 60\xa0hz   typically  slip should be similar to full-load value when machine is running as motor  but negative  generator
