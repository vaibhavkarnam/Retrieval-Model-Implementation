Conservationbiology
 conservation biology is the management of nature and of earth s biodiversity with the aim of protecting species  their habitats  and ecosystems from excessive rates of extinction and the erosion of biotic interactions  1][2][3  it is an interdisciplinary subject drawing on natural and social sciences  and the practice of natural resource management  4][5][6][7   the conservation ethic is based on the findings of conservation biology       the term conservation biology and its conception as a new field originated with the convening of  the first international conference on research in conservation biology  held at the university of california  san diego in la jolla  california in 1978 led by american biologists bruce a  wilcox and michael e  soul xe9 with a group of leading university and zoo researchers and conservationists including kurt benirschke  sir otto frankel  thomas e  lovejoy  and jared m  diamond  the meeting was prompted by the concern over tropical deforestation  disappearing species  eroding genetic diversity within species  8  the conference and proceedings that resulted 2  sought to initiate the bridging of a gap between theory in ecology and evolutionary genetics on the one hand and conservation policy and practice on the other  9  conservation biology and the concept of biological diversity  biodiversity  emerged together  helping crystallize the modern era of conservation science and policy  the inherent multidisciplinary basis for conservation biology has led to new subdisciplines including conservation social science  conservation behavior and conservation physiology  10  it stimulated further development of conservation genetics which otto frankel had originated first but is now often considered a subdiscipline as well   the rapid decline of established biological systems around the world means that conservation biology is often referred to as a  discipline with a deadline   11  conservation biology is tied closely to ecology in researching the population ecology  dispersal  migration  demographics  effective population size  inbreeding depression  and minimum population viability  of rare or endangered species  12][13  conservation biology is concerned with phenomena that affect the maintenance  loss  and restoration of biodiversity and the science of sustaining evolutionary processes that engender genetic  population  species  and ecosystem diversity  5][6][7][13  the concern stems from estimates suggesting that up to 50  of all species on the planet will disappear within the next 50 years  14  which has contributed to poverty  starvation  and will reset the course of evolution on this planet  15][16   conservation biologists research and educate on the trends and process of biodiversity loss  species extinctions  and the negative effect these are having on our capabilities to sustain the well-being of human society  conservation biologists work in the field and office  in government  universities  non-profit organizations and industry  the topics of their research are diverse  because this is an interdisciplinary network with professional alliances in the biological as well as social sciences  those dedicated to the cause and profession advocate for a global response to the current biodiversity crisis based on morals  ethics  and scientific reason  organizations and citizens are responding to the biodiversity crisis through conservation action plans that direct research  monitoring  and education programs that engage concerns at local through global scales  4][5][6][7   the conservation of natural resources is the fundamental problem  unless we solve that problem  it will avail us little to solve all others   conscious efforts to conserve and protect global biodiversity are a recent phenomenon  7][18  natural resource conservation  however  has a history that extends prior to the age of conservation  resource ethics grew out of necessity through direct relations with nature  regulation or communal restraint became necessary to prevent selfish motives from taking more than could be locally sustained  therefore compromising the long-term supply for the rest of the community  7  this social dilemma with respect to natural resource management is often called the  tragedy of the commons   19][20   from this principle  conservation biologists can trace communal resource based ethics throughout cultures as a solution to communal resource conflict  7  for example  the alaskan tlingit peoples and the haida of the pacific northwest had resource boundaries  rules  and restrictions among clans with respect to the fishing of sockeye salmon  these rules were guided by clan elders who knew lifelong details of each river and stream they managed  7][21  there are numerous examples in history where cultures have followed rules  rituals  and organized practice with respect to communal natural resource management  22][23   conservation ethics are also found in early religious and philosophical writings  there are examples in the tao  shinto  hindu  islamic and buddhist traditions  7][24  in greek philosophy  plato lamented about pasture land degradation   what is left now is  so to say  the skeleton of a body wasted by disease  the rich  soft soil has been carried off and only the bare framework of the district left   25  in the bible  through moses  god commanded to let the land rest from cultivation every seventh year  7][26  before the 18th century  however  much of european culture considered it a pagan view to admire nature  wilderness was denigrated while agricultural development was praised  27  however  as early as ad 680 a wildlife sanctuary was founded on the farne islands by st cuthbert in response to his religious beliefs  7   natural history was a major preoccupation in the 18th century  with grand expeditions and the opening of popular public displays in europe and north america  by 1900 there were 150 natural history museums in germany  250 in great britain  250 in the united states  and 300 in france  28  preservationist or conservationist sentiments are a development of the late 18th to early 20th centuries   before charles darwin set sail on the hms beagle  most people in the world  including darwin  believed in special creation and that all species were unchanged  29  george-louis leclerc was one of the first naturalist that questioned this belief  he proposed in his 44 volume natural history book that species evolve due to environmental influences  29  erasmus darwin was also a naturalist who also suggested that species evolved  erasmus darwin noted that some species have vestigial structures which are anatomical structures that have no apparent function in the species currently but would have been useful for the species  ancestors  29  the thinking of these early 18th century naturalist helped to change the mindset and thinking of the early 19th century naturalist   by the early 19th century biogeography was ignited through the efforts of alexander von humboldt  charles lyell and charles darwin  30  the 19th-century fascination with natural history engendered a fervor to be the first to collect rare specimens with the goal of doing so before they became extinct by other such collectors  27][28  although the work of many 18th and 19th century naturalists were to inspire nature enthusiasts and conservation organizations  their writings  by modern standards  showed insensitivity towards conservation as they would kill hundreds of specimens for their collections  28   the modern roots of conservation biology can be found in the late 18th-century enlightenment period particularly in england and scotland  27][31  a number of thinkers  among them notably lord monboddo  31  described the importance of  preserving nature   much of this early emphasis had its origins in christian theology   scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the forests of british india  the conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles  that human activity damaged the environment  that there was a civic duty to maintain the environment for future generations  and that scientific  empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out  sir james ranald martin was prominent in promoting this ideology  publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation  and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in british india through the establishment of forest departments  32   the madras board of revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842  headed by alexander gibson  a professional botanist who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles  this was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world  33  governor-general lord dalhousie introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855  a model that soon spread to other colonies  as well the united states  34][35][36  where yellowstone national park was opened in 1872 as the world u2019s first national park  37   the term conservation came into widespread use in the late 19th century and referred to the management  mainly for economic reasons  of such natural resources as timber  fish  game  topsoil  pastureland  and minerals  in addition it referred to the preservation of forests  forestry   wildlife  wildlife refuge   parkland  wilderness  and watersheds  this period also saw the passage of the first conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies  the sea birds preservation act of 1869 was passed in britain as the first nature protection law in the world 38  after extensive lobbying from the association for the protection of seabirds 39  and the respected ornithologist alfred newton  40  newton was also instrumental in the passage of the first game laws from 1872  which protected animals during their breeding season so as to prevent the stock from being brought close to extinction  41   one of the first conservation societies was the royal society for the protection of birds  founded in 1889 in manchester 42  as a protest group campaigning against the use of great crested grebe and kittiwake skins and feathers in fur clothing  originally known as  the plumage league   43  the group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the fur and feather league in croydon  and formed the rspb  44  the national trust formed in 1895 with the manifesto to     promote the permanent preservation  for the benefit of the nation  of lands     to preserve  so far practicable  their natural aspect    in the united states  the forest reserve act of 1891 gave the president power to set aside forest reserves from the land in the public domain  john muir founded the sierra club in 1892  and the new york zoological society was set up in 1895  a series of national forests and preserves were established by theodore roosevelt from 1901 to 1909.[45][46  the 1916 national parks act  included a  use without impairment  clause  sought by john muir  which eventually resulted in the removal of a proposal to build a dam in dinosaur national monument in 1959.[47   in the 20th century  canadian civil servants  including charles gordon hewitt [9  and james harkin spearheaded the movement toward wildlife conservation  48   in the mid-20th century  efforts arose to target individual species for conservation  notably efforts in big cat conservation in south america led by the new york zoological society  49][10  in the early 20th century the new york zoological society was instrumental in developing concepts of establishing preserves for particular species and conducting the necessary conservation studies to determine the suitability of locations that are most appropriate as conservation priorities  the work of henry fairfield osborn jr   carl e  akeley  archie carr and archie carr iii is notable in this era  50][51  citation needed  akeley for example  having led expeditions to the virunga mountains and observed the mountain gorilla in the wild  became convinced that the species and the area were conservation priorities  he was instrumental in persuading albert i of belgium to act in defense of the mountain gorilla and establish albert national park  since renamed virunga national park  in what is now democratic republic of congo  52   by the 1970s  led primarily by work in the united states under the endangered species act 53  along with the species at risk act  sara  of canada  biodiversity action plans developed in australia  sweden  the united kingdom  hundreds of species specific protection plans ensued  notably the united nations acted to conserve sites of outstanding cultural or natural importance to the common heritage of mankind  the programme was adopted by the general conference of unesco in 1972  as of 2006  a total of 830 sites are listed  644 cultural  162 natural  the first country to pursue aggressive biological conservation through national legislation was the united states  which passed back to back legislation in the endangered species act 54  (1966  and national environmental policy act (1970),[55  which together injected major funding and protection measures to large-scale habitat protection and threatened species research  other conservation developments  however  have taken hold throughout the world  india  for example  passed the wildlife protection act of 1972.[56   in 1980 a significant development was the emergence of the urban conservation movement  a local organization was established in birmingham  uk  a development followed in rapid succession in cities across the uk  then overseas  although perceived as a grassroots movement  its early development was driven by academic research into urban wildlife  initially perceived as radical  the movement s view of conservation being inextricably linked with other human activity has now become mainstream in conservation thought  considerable research effort is now directed at urban conservation biology  the society for conservation biology originated in 1985.[57   by 1992 most of the countries of the world had become committed to the principles of conservation of biological diversity with the convention on biological diversity  58  subsequently many countries began programmes of biodiversity action plans to identify and conserve threatened species within their borders  as well as protect associated habitats  the late 1990s saw increasing professionalism in the sector  with the maturing of organisations such as the institute of ecology and environmental management and the society for the environment   since 2000 the concept of landscape scale conservation has risen to prominence  with less emphasis being given to single-species or even single-habitat focused actions  instead an ecosystem approach is advocated by most mainstream conservationists  although concerns have been expressed by those working to protect some high-profile species   ecology has clarified the workings of the biosphere  i e   the complex interrelationships among humans  other species  and the physical environment  the burgeoning human population and associated agriculture  industry  and the ensuing pollution  have demonstrated how easily ecological relationships can be disrupted  59   extinction rates are measured in a variety of ways  conservation biologists measure and apply statistical measures of fossil records  1][60  rates of habitat loss  and a multitude of other variables such as loss of biodiversity as a function of the rate of habitat loss and site occupancy 61  to obtain such estimates  62  the theory of island biogeography 63  is possibly the most significant contribution toward the scientific understanding of both the process and how to measure the rate of species extinction  the current background extinction rate is estimated to be one species every few years  64   the measure of ongoing species loss is made more complex by the fact that most of the earth s species have not been described or evaluated  estimates vary greatly on how many species actually exist  estimated range  3,600,000-111,700,000)[65  to how many have received a species binomial  estimated range  1.5-8 million   65  less than 1  of all species that have been described have been studied beyond simply noting its existence  65  from these figures  the iucn reports that 23  of vertebrates  5  of invertebrates and 70  of plants that have been evaluated are designated as endangered or threatened  66][67  better knowledge is being constructed by the plant list for actual numbers of species   systematic conservation planning is an effective way to seek and identify efficient and effective types of reserve design to capture or sustain the highest priority biodiversity values and to work with communities in support of local ecosystems  margules and pressey identify six interlinked stages in the systematic planning approach  68   conservation biologists regularly prepare detailed conservation plans for grant proposals or to effectively coordinate their plan of action and to identify best management practices (e g  69    systematic strategies generally employ the services of geographic information systems to assist in the decision making process   conservation physiology was defined by steven j  cooke and colleagues as  \u2018an integrative scientific discipline applying physiological concepts  tools  and knowledge to characterizing biological diversity and its ecological implications  understanding and predicting how organisms  populations  and ecosystems respond to environmental change and stressors  and solving conservation problems across the broad range of taxa  i e  including microbes  plants  and animals   physiology is considered in the broadest possible terms to include functional and mechanistic responses at all scales  and conservation includes the development and refinement of strategies to rebuild populations  restore ecosystems  inform conservation policy  generate decision-support tools  and manage natural resources  u2019[10  conservation physiology is particularly relevant to practitioners in that it has the potential to generate cause-and-effect relationships and reveal the factors that contribute to population declines   the society for conservation biology is a global community of conservation professionals dedicated to advancing the science and practice of conserving biodiversity  conservation biology as a discipline reaches beyond biology  into subjects such as philosophy  law  economics  humanities  arts  anthropology  and education  5][6  within biology  conservation genetics and evolution are immense fields unto themselves  but these disciplines are of prime importance to the practice and profession of conservation biology   is conservation biology an objective science when biologists advocate for an inherent value in nature  do conservationists introduce bias when they support policies using qualitative description  such as habitat degradation  or healthy ecosystems  as all scientists hold values  so do conservation biologists  conservation biologists advocate for reasoned and sensible management of natural resources and do so with a disclosed combination of science  reason  logic  and values in their conservation management plans  5  this sort of advocacy is similar to the medical profession advocating for healthy lifestyle options  both are beneficial to human well-being yet remain scientific in their approach   there is a movement in conservation biology suggesting a new form of leadership is needed to mobilize conservation biology into a more effective discipline that is able to communicate the full scope of the problem to society at large  70  the movement proposes an adaptive leadership approach that parallels an adaptive management approach  the concept is based on a new philosophy or leadership theory steering away from historical notions of power  authority  and dominance  adaptive conservation leadership is reflective and more equitable as it applies to any member of society who can mobilize others toward meaningful change using communication techniques that are inspiring  purposeful  and collegial  adaptive conservation leadership and mentoring programs are being implemented by conservation biologists through organizations such as the aldo leopold leadership program 71   conservation may be classified as either in-situ conservation  which is protecting an endangered species in its natural habitat  or ex-situ conservation  which occurs outside the natural habitat  72  in-situ conservation involves protecting or restoring the habitat  ex-situ conservation  on the other hand  involves protection outside of an organism s natural habitat  such as on reservations or in gene banks  in circumstances where viable populations may not be present in the natural habitat  72   also  non-interference may be used  which is termed a preservationist method  preservationists advocate for giving areas of nature and species a protected existence that halts interference from the humans  5  in this regard  conservationists differ from preservationists in the social dimension  as conservation biology engages society and seeks equitable solutions for both society and ecosystems  some preservationists emphasize the potential of biodiversity in a world without humans   conservation biologists are interdisciplinary researchers that practice ethics in the biological and social sciences  chan states 73  that conservationists must advocate for biodiversity and can do so in a scientifically ethical manner by not promoting simultaneous advocacy against other competing values  a conservationist researches biodiversity and reasons through a resource conservation ethic [11   which identify what measures will deliver  the greatest good for the greatest number of people for the longest time   5]:13  some conservation biologists argue that nature has an intrinsic value that is independent of anthropocentric usefulness or utilitarianism  intrinsic value advocates that a gene  or species  be valued because they have a utility for the ecosystems they sustain  aldo leopold was a classical thinker and writer on such conservation ethics whose philosophy  ethics and writings are still valued and revisited by modern conservation biologists  his writing is often required reading for those in the profession   the international union for the conservation of nature  iucn  has organized a global assortment of scientists and research stations across the planet to monitor the changing state of nature in an effort to tackle the extinction crisis  the iucn provides annual updates on the status of species conservation through its red list  74  the iucn red list serves as an international conservation tool to identify those species most in need of conservation attention and by providing a global index on the status of biodiversity  75  more than the dramatic rates of species loss  however  conservation scientists note that the sixth mass extinction is a biodiversity crisis requiring far more action than a priority focus on rare  endemic or endangered species  concerns for biodiversity loss covers a broader conservation mandate that looks at ecological processes  such as migration  and a holistic examination of biodiversity at levels beyond the species  including genetic  population and ecosystem diversity  76  extensive  systematic  and rapid rates of biodiversity loss threatens the sustained well-being of humanity by limiting supply of ecosystem services that are otherwise regenerated by the complex and evolving holistic network of genetic and ecosystem diversity  while the conservation status of species is employed extensively in conservation management  75  some scientists highlight that it is the common species that are the primary source of exploitation and habitat alteration by humanity  moreover  common species are often undervalued despite their role as the primary source of ecosystem services  77][78   while most in the community of conservation science  stress the importance  of sustaining biodiversity  79  there is debate on how to prioritize genes  species  or ecosystems  which are all components of biodiversity  e g  bowen  1999   while the predominant approach to date has been to focus efforts on endangered species by conserving biodiversity hotspots  some scientists (e g  80  and conservation organizations  such as the nature conservancy  argue that it is more cost-effective  logical  and socially relevant to invest in biodiversity coldspots  81  the costs of discovering  naming  and mapping out the distribution of every species  they argue  is an ill-advised conservation venture  they reason it is better to understand the significance of the ecological roles of species  82   biodiversity hotspots and coldspots are a way of recognizing that the spatial concentration of genes  species  and ecosystems is not uniformly distributed on the earth s surface  for example         44  of all species of vascular plants and 35  of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4  of the land surface of the earth   83   those arguing in favor of setting priorities for coldspots point out that there are other measures to consider beyond biodiversity  they point out that emphasizing hotspots downplays the importance of the social and ecological connections to vast areas of the earth s ecosystems where biomass  not biodiversity  reigns supreme  84  it is estimated that 36  of the earth s surface  encompassing 38.9  of the worlds vertebrates  lacks the endemic species to qualify as biodiversity hotspot  85  moreover  measures show that maximizing protections for biodiversity does not capture ecosystem services any better than targeting randomly chosen regions  86  population level biodiversity  i e  coldspots  are disappearing at a rate that is ten times that at the species level  80][87  the level of importance in addressing biomass versus endemism as a concern for conservation biology is highlighted in literature measuring the level of threat to global ecosystem carbon stocks that do not necessarily reside in areas of endemism  88][89  a hotspot priority approach 90  would not invest so heavily in places such as steppes  the serengeti  the arctic  or taiga  these areas contribute a great abundance of population  not species  level biodiversity 87  and ecosystem services  including cultural value and planetary nutrient cycling  91   summary of 2006 iucn red list categories   those in favor of the hotspot approach point out that species are irreplaceable components of the global ecosystem  they are concentrated in places that are most threatened  and should therefore receive maximal strategic protections  92  the iucn red list categories  which appear on wikipedia species articles  is an example of the hotspot conservation approach in action  species that are not rare or endemic are listed the least concern and their wikipedia articles tend to be ranked low on the importance scale  dubious \u2013 discuss  this is a hotspot approach because the priority is set to target species level concerns over population level or biomass  87  not in citation given  species richness and genetic biodiversity contributes to and engenders ecosystem stability  ecosystem processes  evolutionary adaptability  and biomass  93  both sides agree  however  that conserving biodiversity is necessary to reduce the extinction rate and identify an inherent value in nature  the debate hinges on how to prioritize limited conservation resources in the most cost-effective way   conservation biologists have started to collaborate with leading global economists to determine how to measure the wealth and services of nature and to make these values apparent in global market transactions  94  this system of accounting is called natural capital and would  for example  register the value of an ecosystem before it is cleared to make way for development  95  the wwf publishes its living planet report and provides a global index of biodiversity by monitoring approximately 5,000\xa0populations in 1,686\xa0species of vertebrate  mammals  birds  fish  reptiles  and amphibians  and report on the trends in much the same way that the stock market is tracked  96   this method of measuring the global economic benefit of nature has been endorsed by the g8+5 leaders and the european commission  94  nature sustains many ecosystem services 97  that benefit humanity  98  many of the earths ecosystem services are public goods without a market and therefore no price or value  94  when the stock market registers a financial crisis  traders on wall street are not in the business of trading stocks for much of the planet s living natural capital stored in ecosystems  there is no natural stock market with investment portfolios into sea horses  amphibians  insects  and other creatures that provide a sustainable supply of ecosystem services that are valuable to society  98  the ecological footprint of society has exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity limits of the planet s ecosystems by about 30\xa0percent  which is the same percentage of vertebrate populations that have registered decline from 1970 through 2005.[96   the ecological credit crunch is a global challenge  the living planet report 2008 tells us that more than three-quarters of the world s people live in nations that are ecological debtors \u2013 their national consumption has outstripped their country s biocapacity  thus  most of us are propping up our current lifestyles  and our economic growth  by drawing  and increasingly overdrawing  upon the ecological capital of other parts of the world   the inherent natural economy plays an essential role in sustaining humanity  99  including the regulation of global atmospheric chemistry  pollinating crops  pest control  100  cycling soil nutrients  purifying our water supply  101  supplying medicines and health benefits  102  and unquantifiable quality of life improvements  there is a relationship  a correlation  between markets and natural capital  and social income inequity and biodiversity loss  this means that there are greater rates of biodiversity loss in places where the inequity of wealth is greatest 103   although a direct market comparison of natural capital is likely insufficient in terms of human value  one measure of ecosystem services suggests the contribution amounts to trillions of dollars yearly  104][105][106][107  for example  one segment of north american forests has been assigned an annual value of 250 billion dollars  108  as another example  honey-bee pollination is estimated to provide between 10 and 18 billion dollars of value yearly  109  the value of ecosystem services on one new zealand island has been imputed to be as great as the gdp of that region  110  this planetary wealth is being lost at an incredible rate as the demands of human society is exceeding the bio-regenerative capacity of the earth  while biodiversity and ecosystems are resilient  the danger of losing them is that humans cannot recreate many ecosystem functions through technological innovation   some species  called a keystone species form a central supporting hub unique to their the ecosystem  111  the loss of such a species results in a collapse in ecosystem function  as well as the loss of coexisting species  5  keystone species are usually predators due to their ability to control the population of prey in their ecosystem  111  the importance of a keystone species was shown by the extinction of the steller s sea cow  hydrodamalis gigas  through its interaction with sea otters  sea urchins  and kelp  kelp beds grow and form nurseries in shallow waters to shelter creatures that support the food chain  sea urchins feed on kelp  while sea otters feed on sea urchins  with the rapid decline of sea otters due to overhunting  sea urchin populations grazed unrestricted on the kelp beds and the ecosystem collapsed  left unchecked  the urchins destroyed the shallow water kelp communities that supported the steller s sea cow s diet and hastened their demise  112  the sea otter was thought to be a keystone species because the coexistence of many ecological associates in the kelp beds relied upon otters for their survival  however this was later questioned by turvey and risley  113  who showed that hunting alone would have driven the steller s sea cow extinct   an indicator species has a narrow set of ecological requirements  therefore they become useful targets for observing the health of an ecosystem  some animals  such as amphibians with their semi-permeable skin and linkages to wetlands  have an acute sensitivity to environmental harm and thus may serve as a miner s canary  indicator species are monitored in an effort to capture environmental degradation through pollution or some other link to proximate human activities  5  monitoring an indicator species is a measure to determine if there is a significant environmental impact that can serve to advise or modify practice  such as through different forest silviculture treatments and management scenarios  or to measure the degree of harm that a pesticide may impart on the health of an ecosystem   government regulators  consultants  or ngos regularly monitor indicator species  however  there are limitations coupled with many practical considerations that must be followed for the approach to be effective  114  it is generally recommended that multiple indicators  genes  populations  species  communities  and landscape  be monitored for effective conservation measurement that prevents harm to the complex  and often unpredictable  response from ecosystem dynamics  noss  1997[115]:88\u201389    an example of an umbrella species is the monarch butterfly  because of its lengthy migrations and aesthetic value  the monarch migrates across north america  covering multiple ecosystems and so requires a large area to exist  any protections afforded to the monarch butterfly will at the same time umbrella many other species and habitats  an umbrella species is often used as flagship species  which are species  such as the giant panda  the blue whale  the tiger  the mountain gorilla and the monarch butterfly  that capture the public s attention and attract support for conservation measures  5   conservation biologists study trends and process from the paleontological past to the ecological present as they gain an understanding of the context related to species extinction  1  it is generally accepted that there have been five major global mass extinctions that register in earth s history  these include  the ordovician (440 mya   devonian (370 mya   permian u2013triassic (245 mya   triassic u2013jurassic (200 mya   and cretaceous u2013paleogene extinction event (66 mya  extinction spasms  within the last 10,000 years  human influence over the earth s ecosystems has been so extensive that scientists have difficulty estimating the number of species lost  116  that is to say the rates of deforestation  reef destruction  wetland draining and other human acts are proceeding much faster than human assessment of species  the latest living planet report by the world wide fund for nature estimates that we have exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity of the planet  requiring 1.5 earths to support the demands placed on our natural resources  117   conservation biologists are dealing with and have published evidence from all corners of the planet indicating that humanity may be causing the sixth and fastest planetary extinction event  118][119][120  it has been suggested that we are living in an era of unprecedented numbers of species extinctions  also known as the holocene extinction event  121  the global extinction rate may be approximately 1,000 times higher than the natural background extinction rate  122  it is estimated that two-thirds of all mammal genera and one-half of all mammal species weighing at least 44 kilograms (97\xa0lb  have gone extinct in the last 50,000 years  113][123][124][125  the global amphibian assessment 126  reports that amphibians are declining on a global scale faster than any other vertebrate group  with over 32  of all surviving species being threatened with extinction  the surviving populations are in continual decline in 43  of those that are threatened  since the mid-1980s the actual rates of extinction have exceeded 211 times rates measured from the fossil record  127  however   the current amphibian extinction rate may range from 25,039 to 45,474 times the background extinction rate for amphibians   127  the global extinction trend occurs in every major vertebrate group that is being monitored  for example  23  of all mammals and 12  of all birds are red listed by the international union for conservation of nature  iucn   meaning they too are threatened with extinction  even though extinction is natural  the decline in species is happening at such an incredible rate that evolution can simply not match  therefore  leading to the greatest continual mass extinction on earth  128  humans have dominated the planet and our high consumption of resources  along with the pollution generated is affecting the environments in which other species live  128][129  there are a wide variety of species that humans are working to protect such as the hawaiian crow and the whooping crane of texas  130  people can also take action on preserving species by advocating and voting for policies that improve climate  the earth s oceans especially require attention  as climate change has altered ph levels making it inhabitable for organisms with shells  that are dissolving as a result  122   global assessments of coral reefs of the world continue to report drastic and rapid rates of decline  by 2000  27  of the world s coral reef ecosystems had effectively collapsed  the largest period of decline occurred in a dramatic  bleaching  event in 1998  where approximately 16  of all the coral reefs in the world disappeared in less than a year  coral bleaching is caused by a mixture of environmental stresses  including increases in ocean temperatures and acidity  causing both the release of symbiotic algae and death of corals  131  decline and extinction risk in coral reef biodiversity has risen dramatically in the past ten years  the loss of coral reefs  which are predicted to go extinct in the next century  threatens the balance of global biodiversity  will have huge economic impacts  and endangers food security for hundreds of millions of people  132  conservation biology plays an important role in international agreements covering the world s oceans 131   and other issues pertaining to biodiversity 133     these predictions will undoubtedly appear extreme  but it is difficult to imagine how such changes will not come to pass without fundamental changes in human behavior   the oceans are threatened by acidification due to an increase in co2 levels  this is a most serious threat to societies relying heavily upon oceanic natural resources  a concern is that the majority of all marine species will not be able to evolve or acclimate in response to the changes in the ocean chemistry  134   the prospects of averting mass extinction seems unlikely when        90  of all of the large  average approximately \u226550 kg   open ocean tuna  billfishes  and sharks in the ocean  16  are reportedly gone  given the scientific review of current trends  the ocean is predicted to have few surviving multi-cellular organisms with only microbes left to dominate marine ecosystems  16   serious concerns also being raised about taxonomic groups that do not receive the same degree of social attention or attract funds as the vertebrates  these include fungal  including lichen-forming species   135  invertebrate  particularly insect 14][136][137   and plant communities where the vast majority of biodiversity is represented  conservation of fungi and conservation of insects  in particular  are both of pivotal importance for conservation biology  as mycorrhizal symbionts  and as decomposers and recyclers  fungi are essential for sustainability of forests  135  the value of insects in the biosphere is enormous because they outnumber all other living groups in measure of species richness  the greatest bulk of biomass on land is found in plants  which is sustained by insect relations  this great ecological value of insects is countered by a society that often reacts negatively toward these aesthetically  unpleasant  creatures  138][139   one area of concern in the insect world that has caught the public eye is the mysterious case of missing honey bees  apis mellifera   honey bees provide an indispensable ecological services through their acts of pollination supporting a huge variety of agriculture crops  the use of honey and wax have become vastly used throughout the world  140  the sudden disappearance of bees leaving empty hives or colony collapse disorder  ccd  is not uncommon  however  in 16-month period from 2006 through 2007  29  of 577 beekeepers across the united states reported ccd losses in up to 76  of their colonies  this sudden demographic loss in bee numbers is placing a strain on the agricultural sector  the cause behind the massive declines is puzzling scientists  pests  pesticides  and global warming are all being considered as possible causes  141][142   another highlight that links conservation biology to insects  forests  and climate change is the mountain pine beetle  dendroctonus ponderosae  epidemic of british columbia  canada  which has infested 470,000\xa0km2 (180,000\xa0sq xa0mi  of forested land since 1999.[88  an action plan has been prepared by the government of british columbia to address this problem  143   this impact  pine beetle epidemic  converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak  in the worst year  the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in british columbia were equivalent to 75  of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of canada during 1959\u20131999   a large proportion of parasite species are threatened by extinction  a few of them are being eradicated as pests of humans or domestic animals  however  most of them are harmless  threats include the decline or fragmentation of host populations  or the extinction of host species   today  many threats to biodiversity exist  an acronym that can be used to express the top threats of present-day h i p p o stands for habitat loss  invasive species  pollution  human population  and overharvesting  144  the primary threats to biodiversity are habitat destruction  such as deforestation  agricultural expansion  urban development   and overexploitation  such as wildlife trade   116][145][146][147][148][149  habitat fragmentation also poses challenges  because the global network of protected areas only covers 11.5  of the earth s surface  150  a significant consequence of fragmentation and lack of linked protected areas is the reduction of animal migration on a global scale  considering that billions of tonnes of biomass are responsible for nutrient cycling across the earth  the reduction of migration is a serious matter for conservation biology  151][152   human activities are associated directly or indirectly with nearly every aspect of the current extinction spasm   however  human activities need not necessarily cause irreparable harm to the biosphere  with conservation management and planning for biodiversity at all levels  from genes to ecosystems  there are examples where humans mutually coexist in a sustainable way with nature  153  even with the current threats to biodiversity there are ways we can improve the current condition and start anew   many of the threats to biodiversity  including disease and climate change  are reaching inside borders of protected areas  leaving them  not-so protected   e g  yellowstone national park   154  climate change  for example  is often cited as a serious threat in this regard  because there is a feedback loop between species extinction and the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere  88][89  ecosystems store and cycle large amounts of carbon which regulates global conditions  155  in present day  there have been major climate shifts with temperature changes making survival of some species difficult  144  the effects of global warming add a catastrophic threat toward a mass extinction of global biological diversity  156  conservationists have claimed that not all the species can be saved  and they have to decide which their efforts should be used to protect  this concept is known as the conservation triage  144  the extinction threat is estimated to range from 15 to 37 percent of all species by 2050,[156  or 50 percent of all species over the next 50 years  14  the current extinction rate is 100-100,000 times more rapid today than the last several billion years  144
