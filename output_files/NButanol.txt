NButanol
[butanol n1-butanol nbutyl alcohol nbutyl hydrate nbutylic alcohol nbutyralcohol nbutyric alcohol nbutyryl alcohol nn-butyl alcohol n1-hydroxybutane  n-butanol or n-butyl alcohol or normal butanol is a primary alcohol with a 4-carbon structure and the chemical formula c4h9oh  its isomers include isobutanol  2-butanol  and tert-butanol  butanol is one of the group of  fusel alcohols   from the german for  bad liquor    which have more than two carbon atoms and have significant solubility in water   n-butanol occurs naturally as a minor product of the fermentation of sugars and other carbohydrates  6  and is present in many foods and beverages  7][8  it is also a permitted artificial flavorant in the united states  9  used in butter  cream  fruit  rum  whiskey  ice cream and ices  candy  baked goods and cordials  10  it is also used in a wide range of consumer products  7   the largest use of n-butanol is as an industrial intermediate  particularly for the manufacture of butyl acetate  itself an artificial flavorant and industrial solvent   it is a petrochemical  manufactured from propylene and usually used close to the point of manufacture  estimated production figures for 1997 are  united states 784,000\xa0tonnes  western europe 575,000\xa0tonnes  japan 225,000\xa0tonnes  8       n-butanol is produced industrially from the petrochemical feedstock propylene  propylene is hydroformylated to butyraldehyde  oxo process  in the presence of a rhodium-based homogeneous catalyst similar to wilkinson s catalyst  the butyraldehyde is then hydrogenated to produce n-butanol  8   n-butanol is an intermediate in the production of butyl acrylate  butyl acetate  dibutyl phthalate  dibutyl sebacate  and other butyl esters  11][12  butyl ethers such as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether  di- and triethylene glycol monobutyl ether  and the corresponding butyl ether acetates  other industrial uses include the manufacture of pharmaceuticals  polymers  pyroxylin plastics  herbicide esters  printing  e g   2,4-d  2,4,5-t  13  and butyl xanthate  it is also used as a diluent reactant in the manufacture of urea u2013formaldehyde and melamine u2013formaldehyde resins  8   n-butanol is used as an ingredient in perfumes and as a solvent for the extraction of essential oils  11  n-butanol is also used as an extractant in the manufacture of antibiotics  hormones  and vitamins  11][12  a solvent for paints  coatings  natural resins  gums  synthetic resins  dyes  alkaloids  and camphor  11][12  other miscellaneous applications of n-butanol are as a swelling agent in textiles  as a component of hydraulic brake fluids  cleaning formulations  degreasers  and repellents  7  and as a component of ore floation agents  13  and of wood-treating systems  14   n-butanol has been proposed as a substitute for diesel fuel and gasoline  it is produced in small quantities in nearly all fermentations  see fusel oil   but species of clostridium produce much higher yields of butanol  and research is currently underway to increase the ultimate yield of biobutanol from biomass   the production or  in some cases  use of the following substances may result in exposure to n-butanol  artificial leather  butyl esters  rubber cement  dyes  fruit essences  lacquers  motion picture  and photographic films  raincoats  perfumes  pyroxylin plastics  rayon  safety glass  shellac varnish  and waterproofed cloth  7   honey bees use n-butanol as an alarm pheromone   n-butanol occurs naturally as a result of carbohydrate fermentation in a number of alcoholic beverages  including beer  15  grape brandies  16  wine  17  and whisky  18  it has been detected in the volatiles of hops  19  jack fruit  20  heat-treated milks  21  musk melon  22  cheese  23  southern pea seed  24  and cooked rice  25  n-butanol is also formed during deep frying of corn oil  cottonseed oil  trilinolein  and triolein  26   n-butanol is used as an ingredient in processed and artificial flavourings  11  and for the extraction of lipid-free protein from egg yolk  27  natural flavouring materials and vegetable oils  the manufacture of hop extract for beermaking  and as a solvent in removing pigments from moist curd leaf protein concentrate  28   n-butanol is readily absorbed through the intestinal tract and lungs  and also to some extent through the skin  29  it is metabolized completely in vertebrates in a manner similar to ethanol  alcohol dehydrogenase converts n-butanol to butyraldehyde  this is then converted to butyric acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase  butyric acid can be fully metabolized to carbon dioxide and water by the \u03b2-oxidation pathway  in the rat  only 0.03  of an oral dose of 2,000\xa0mg kg was excreted in the urine  30   the acute toxicity of n-butanol is relatively low  with oral ld50 values of 790\u20134,360\xa0mg kg  rat  comparable values for ethanol are 7,000\u201315,000\xa0mg kg   8][31  no deaths were reported at an inhaled concentration of 8,000\xa0ppm (4-hour exposure  rats   at sub-lethal doses  n-butanol acts as a depressant of the central nervous system  similar to ethanol  one study in rats indicated that the intoxicating potency of n-butanol is some six times higher than that of ethanol  possibly because of its slower transformation by alcohol dehydrogenase  32   n-butanol is a natural component of many alcoholic beverages  albeit in low  but variable  concentrations  33][34  it  along with similar fusel alcohols  is reputed to be responsible for severe  hangovers   although experiments in animal models show no evidence for this  35  an unknown dose n-butanol was consumed by a 47-year-old male with no previous medical history  leading to a range of adverse health effects  clarification needed  36   liquid n-butanol  as is common with most organic solvents  is extremely irritating to the eyes  repeated contact with the skin can also cause irritation  8  this is believed to be a generic effect of  defatting   no skin sensitization has been observed  irritation of the respiratory pathways occurs only at very high concentrations (&gt 2,400\xa0ppm   37   with a flash point of 35\xa0\xb0c  n-butanol presents a moderate fire hazard  it is slightly more flammable than kerosene or diesel fuel but less flammable than many other common organic solvents  the depressant effect on the central nervous system  similar to ethanol intoxication  is a potential hazard when working with n-butanol in enclosed spaces  although the odour threshold (0.2\u201330\xa0ppm  is far below the concentration which would have any neurological effect  37][38   n-butanol is of low toxicity to aquatic vertebrates and invertebrates  it is rapidly biodegraded in water  although an estimated 83  partitions to air where it is degraded by hydroxyl radicals with a half-life of 1.2\u20132.3\xa0days  it has low potential to bioaccumulate  8  a potential hazard of significant discharges to watercourses is the rise in chemical oxygen demand  c o d   associated with its biodegradation
