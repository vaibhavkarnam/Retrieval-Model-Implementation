later in his career  gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors  donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the bill  amp  melinda gates foundation  established in 2000   gates stepped down as chief executive officer of microsoft in january 2000  he remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect

ancestry includes english  german  irish  and scots-irish  16][17  his father was a prominent lawyer  and his mother served on the board of directors for first interstate bancsystem and the united way  gates  maternal grandfather was jw maxwell  a national bank president  gates has one elder sister  kristi  kristianne   and one younger sister  libby  he is the fourth of his name in his family  but is known as william gates iii or  trey  because his father had the  ii  suffix  18  early on in his life  gates  parents had a law career in mind for him  19  when gates was young  his family regularly attended a church of the congregational christian churches  a protestant reformed denomination  20][21][22  the family encouraged competition  one visitor reported that  it didn t matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock     there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing   23   at 13  he enrolled in the lakeside school  a private preparatory school  24  when he was in the eighth grade  the mothers club at the school used proceeds from lakeside school s rummage sale to buy a teletype model 33 asr terminal and a block of computer time on a general electric  ge  computer for the school s students  25  gates took an interest in programming the ge system in basic  and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest  he wrote his first computer program on this machine  an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer  gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly  when he reflected back on that moment  he said   there was just something neat about the machine   26  after the mothers club donation was exhausted  he and other students sought time on systems including dec pdp minicomputers  one of these systems was a pdp-10 belonging to computer center corporation  ccc   which banned four lakeside students xa0\u2013 gates  paul allen  ric weiland  and kent evans xa0\u2013 for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time  27][28   at the end of the ban  the four students offered to find bugs in ccc s software in exchange for computer time  rather than use the system via teletype  gates went to ccc s offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system  including programs in fortran  lisp  and machine language  the arrangement with ccc continued until 1970  when the company went out of business  the following year  information sciences  inc  hired the four lakeside students to write a payroll program in cobol  providing them computer time and royalties  after his administrators became aware of his programming abilities  gates wrote the school s computer program to schedule students in classes  he modified the code so that he was placed in classes with  a disproportionate number of interesting girls   29  he later stated that  it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which i could so unambiguously demonstrate success   26  at age 17  gates formed a venture with allen  called traf-o-data  to make traffic counters based on the intel 8008 processor  30  in early 1973  bill gates served as a congressional page in the u s  house of representatives  31   gates graduated from lakeside school in 1973  and was a national merit scholar  32  he scored 1590 out of 1600 on the scholastic aptitude tests 33  and enrolled at harvard college in the autumn of 1973.[34  he chose a pre-law major but took rigorous mathematics and graduate level computer science courses  35  while at harvard  he met fellow student steve ballmer  gates left harvard after two years while ballmer would stay and graduate magna cum laude  years later  ballmer succeeded gates as ceo of microsoft before resigning from the company in 2014.[36   in his second year  gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems 37  presented in a combinatorics class by harry lewis  one of his professors  gates  solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years  37][38  its successor is faster by only one percent  37  his solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with harvard computer scientist christos papadimitriou  39   gates did not have a definite study plan while a student at harvard 40  and spent a lot of time using the school s computers  gates remained in contact with paul allen  and he joined him at honeywell during the summer of 1974.[41  the following year saw the release of the mits altair 8800 based on the intel 8080 cpu  and gates and allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company  42  gates dropped out of harvard at this time  he had talked this decision over with his parents  who were supportive of him after seeing how much gates wanted to start his own company  40  gates explained his official status with harvard that      if things  microsoft  hadn t worked out  i could always go back to school  i was officially on  a  leave  of absence    43   after reading the january 1975 issue of popular electronics that demonstrated the altair 8800  gates contacted micro instrumentation and telemetry systems  mits   the creators of the new microcomputer  to inform them that he and others were working on a basic interpreter for the platform  44  in reality  gates and allen did not have an altair and had not written code for it  they merely wanted to gauge mits s interest  mits president ed roberts agreed to meet them for a demo  and over the course of a few weeks they developed an altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer  and then the basic interpreter  the demonstration  held at mits s offices in albuquerque  was a success and resulted in a deal with mits to distribute the interpreter as altair basic  paul allen was hired into mits  45  and gates took a leave of absence from harvard to work with allen at mits in albuquerque in november 1975  they named their partnership  micro-soft  and had their first office located in albuquerque  45  within a year  the hyphen was dropped  and on november 26  1976  the trade name  microsoft  was registered with the office of the secretary of the state of new mexico  45  gates never returned to harvard to complete his studies   microsoft s altair basic was popular with computer hobbyists  but gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed  in february 1976  gates wrote an open letter to hobbyists in the mits newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90  of the users of microsoft altair basic had not paid microsoft for it and by doing so the altair  hobby market  was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce  distribute  and maintain high-quality software  46  this letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists  but gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment  microsoft became independent of mits in late 1976  and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems  45  the company moved from albuquerque to its new home in bellevue  washington  on january 1  1979.[44   during microsoft s early years  all employees had broad responsibility for the company s business  gates oversaw the business details  but continued to write code as well  in the first five years  gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped  and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit  47  unreliable source    ibm approached microsoft in july 1980 regarding its upcoming personal computer  the ibm pc  48  the computer company first proposed that microsoft write the basic interpreter  when ibm s representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system  gates referred them to digital research  dri   makers of the widely used cp m operating system  49  ibm s discussions with digital research went poorly  and they did not reach a licensing agreement  ibm representative jack sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system  a few weeks later  gates proposed using 86-dos  qdos   an operating system similar to cp m that tim paterson of seattle computer products  scp  had made for hardware similar to the pc  microsoft made a deal with scp to become the exclusive licensing agent  and later the full owner  of 86-dos  after adapting the operating system for the pc  microsoft delivered it to ibm as pc dos in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.[50   gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating system  because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone ibm s system  50  they did  and the sales of ms-dos made microsoft a major player in the industry  51  despite ibm s name on the operating system the press quickly identified microsoft as being very influential on the new computer  pc magazine asked if gates were  the man behind the machine    48  and infoworld quoted an expert as stating  it s gates  computer   52  gates oversaw microsoft s company restructuring on june 25  1981  which re-incorporated the company in washington state and made gates the president of microsoft and its board chairman  44   microsoft launched its first retail version of microsoft windows on november 20  1985  and in august  the company struck a deal with ibm to develop a separate operating system called os 2  although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system  mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate  53   from microsoft s founding in 1975 until 2006  gates had primary responsibility for the company s product strategy  he aggressively broadened the company s range of products  and wherever microsoft achieved a dominant position he vigorously defended it  citation needed  he gained a reputation for being distant to others  as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that  gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls   54  another executive recalled that after he showed gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times  when they met again a month later gates  won or tied every game  he had studied the game until he solved it  that is a competitor   55   as an executive  gates met regularly with microsoft s senior managers and program managers  firsthand accounts of these meetings describe him as verbally combative  berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company s long-term interests at risk  56][57  he interrupted presentations with such comments  that s the stupidest thing i ve ever heard   58  and  why don t you just give up your options and join the peace corps   59  the target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until  hopefully  gates was fully convinced  58  when subordinates appeared to be procrastinating  he was known to remark sarcastically   i ll do it over the weekend   60][61][62   gates was an active software developer in microsoft s early history  particularly on the company s programming language products  but his role most of its history was primarily as management and executive  gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the trs-80 model 100,[63  but wrote code as late as 1989 that shipped in the company s products  61  he remained interested in technical details  jerry pournelle wrote in 1985 that when watching gates announcing microsoft excel   something else impressed me  bill gates likes the program  not because it s going to make him a lot of money  although i m sure it will do that   but because it s a neat hack   64  on june 15  2006  gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy  he divided his responsibilities between two successors  placing ray ozzie in charge of day-to-day management and craig mundie in charge of long-term product strategy  65   many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over microsoft s business practices have had gates  approval  in the 1998 united states v  microsoft case  gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive  he argued with examiner david boies over the contextual meaning of words such as   compete    concerned   and  we   the judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition  66  businessweek reported   early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying  i don t recall   so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle  worse  many of the technology chief s denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that gates both sent and received  67   gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by boies to mischaracterize his words and actions  as to his demeanor during the deposition  he said   did i fence with boies      i plead guilty  whatever that penalty is should be levied against me  rudeness to boies in the first degree   68  despite gates  denials  the judge ruled that microsoft had committed monopolization and tying  and blocking competition  both in violation of the sherman antitrust act  68   gates appeared in a series of ads to promote microsoft in 2008  the first commercial  co-starring jerry seinfeld  is a 90-second talk between strangers as seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store  shoe circus  in a mall and notices gates buying shoes inside  the salesman is trying to sell mr  gates shoes that are a size too big  as gates is buying the shoes  he holds up his discount card  which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in new mexico in 1977  for a traffic violation  69  as they are walking out of the mall  seinfeld asks gates if he has melded his mind to other developers  after getting a  yes   he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible  again getting a  yes   some say that this is an homage to seinfeld s own show about  nothing  (seinfeld   70  in a second commercial in the series  gates and seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people  71   since leaving day-to-day operations at microsoft  gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects   according to the bloomberg billionaires index  gates was the world s highest-earning billionaire in 2013  as his fortune increased

seasons hotels and resorts  and corbis corp  72  on february 4  2014  gates stepped down as chairman of microsoft to become technology advisor alongside satya nadella  15][73   in a substantial interview with rolling stone magazine  published in march 27  2014 issue  gates provided his perspective on a range of issues  such as climate change  his charitable activities  various tech companies and people involved in them  and the state of america  in response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future  gates stated       there ll be some really bad things that ll happen in the next 50 or 100 years  but hopefully none of them on the scale of  say  a million people that you didn t expect to die from a pandemic  or nuclear or bioterrorism   gates also identified innovation as the  real driver of progress  and pronounced that  america s way better today than it s ever been   74  gates  days are planned for him  similar to the us president s schedule

an interview with rolling stone  gates stated in regard to his faith   the moral systems of religion  i think  are super important  we ve raised our kids in a religious way  they ve gone to the catholic church that melinda goes to and i participate in  i ve been very lucky  and therefore i owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world  and that s kind of a religious belief  i mean  it s at least a moral belief  77   in the same interview  gates said   i agree with people like richard dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths  before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that  we sought false explanations for them  now science has filled in some of the realm xa0\u2013 not all xa0\u2013 that religion used to fill  but the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing  and there s no scientific explanation of how it came about  to say that it was generated by random numbers  that does seem  you know  sort of an uncharitable view  laughs   i think it makes sense to believe in god  but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it  i don t know   77   among gates  private acquisitions

  82  despite his wealth and extensive business travel gates usually flew coach until 1997  when he bought a private jet  83  since 2000  the nominal value of his microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in microsoft s stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations  in a may 2006 interview  gates commented that he
