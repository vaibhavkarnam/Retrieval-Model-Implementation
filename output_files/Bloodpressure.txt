Bloodpressure
 blood pressure  bp  is the pressure of circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels  when used without further specification   blood pressure  usually refers to the pressure in large arteries of the systemic circulation  blood pressure is usually expressed in terms of the systolic pressure  maximum during one heart beat  pressure over diastolic pressure  minimum in between two heart beats  and is measured in millimeters of mercury  mmhg   above the surrounding atmospheric pressure  considered to be zero for convenience    it is one of the vital signs  along with respiratory rate  heart rate  oxygen saturation  and body temperature  normal resting blood pressure in an adult is approximately 120\xa0mmhg systolic  and 80\xa0mmhg diastolic  abbreviated "120/80\xa0mmhg    traditionally  blood pressure was measured non-invasively using a mercury manometer and this is still generally considered the gold standard  1  more recently other semi-automated methods have become common  largely due to concerns about potential mercury toxicity  2  although cost and ease of use have also influenced this trend  1  early alternatives to mercury sphygmomanometers were often inaccurate  but more modern validated devices have similar accuracy to mercury devices  1   blood pressure is influenced by cardiac output  total peripheral resistance and arterial stiffness and varies depending on situation  emotional state  activity  and relative health disease states  in the short term it is regulated by baroreceptors which act via the brain to influence nervous and endocrine systems   blood pressure that is low due to a disease state is called hypotension  and pressure that is consistently high is hypertension  both have many causes and may be of sudden onset or of long duration  long term hypertension is a risk factor for many diseases  including heart disease  stroke and kidney failure  long term hypertension is more common than long term hypotension  long term hypertension often goes undetected because of infrequent monitoring and the absence of symptoms   the risk of cardiovascular disease increases progressively above 115/75\xa0mmhg  6  in practice blood pressure is considered too low only if noticeable symptoms are present  4   observational studies demonstrate that people who maintain arterial pressures at the low end of these pressure ranges have much better long term cardiovascular health  there is an ongoing medical debate over what is the optimal level of blood pressure to target when using drugs to lower blood pressure with hypertension  particularly in older people  7   the table shows the classification of blood pressure adopted by the american heart association for adults who are 18 years and older  3  it assumes the values are a result of averaging resting blood pressure readings measured at two or more visits to the doctor  8][9   in the uk  clinic blood pressures are usually categorized into three groups  low (90/60 or lower   normal  between 90/60 and 139/89   and high (140/90 or higher   10][11   blood pressure fluctuates from minute to minute and normally shows a circadian rhythm over a 24-hour period  with highest readings in the early morning and evenings and lowest readings at night  12][13  loss of the normal fall in blood pressure at night is associated with a greater future risk of cardiovascular disease and there is evidence that night-time blood pressure is a stronger predictor of cardiovascular events than day-time blood pressure  14  also  an individual s blood pressure varies with exercise  emotional reactions  sleep  digestion and time of day  circadian rhythm    various other factors  such as age and sex  also influence a person s blood pressure  in children  the normal ranges are lower than for adults and depend on height  15  reference blood pressure values have been developed for children in different countries  based on the distribution of blood pressure in children of these countries  16  as adults age  systolic pressure tends to rise and diastolic pressure tends to fall  17  consequently  in the elderly  systolic blood pressure often exceeds the normal adult range  18  this is thought to be due to increased stiffness of the arteries  19   differences between left and right arm blood pressure measurements tend to be small  however  occasionally there is a consistent difference greater than 10\xa0mmhg which may need further investigation  e g  for obstructive arterial disease  20][21   the mean arterial pressure  map  is the average over a cardiac cycle and is determined by the cardiac output  co   systemic vascular resistance  svr   and central venous pressure (cvp   23   in practice the contribution of cvp  which is small  is generally ignored and so  map can be estimated from measurements of the systolic pressure  n n n n n np n nsys n n n n n   displaystyle \\!p    text sys    n n xa0 and the diastolic pressure  n n n n n np n ndias n n n n n

results from the pulsatile nature of the cardiac output  i e  the heartbeat  pulse pressure is determined by the interaction of the stroke volume of the heart  the compliance  ability to expand  of the arterial system u2014largely attributable to the aorta and large elastic arteries u2014and the resistance to flow in the arterial tree  by expanding under pressure  the aorta absorbs some of the force of the blood surge from the heart during a heartbeat  in this way  the pulse pressure is reduced from what it would be if the aorta were not compliant  24  the loss of arterial compliance that occurs with aging explains the elevated pulse pressures found in elderly patients   pulmonary capillary wedge pressure  blood pressure generally refers to the arterial pressure in the systemic circulation  however  measurement of pressures in the venous system and the pulmonary vessels plays an important role in intensive care medicine but requires invasive measurement of pressure using a catheter   venous pressure is the vascular pressure in a vein or in the atria of the heart  it is much less than arterial pressure  with common values of 5\xa0mmhg in the right atrium and 8\xa0mmhg in the left atrium   variants of venous pressure include   normally  the pressure in the pulmonary artery is about 15\xa0mmhg at rest  29   increased blood pressure in the capillaries of the lung cause pulmonary hypertension  leading to interstitial edema if the pressure increases to above 20\xa0mmhg  and to pulmonary edema at pressures above 25\xa0mmhg  30   disorders of blood pressure control include  high blood pressure  low blood pressure  and blood pressure that shows excessive or maladaptive fluctuation   arterial hypertension can be an indicator of other problems and may have long-term adverse effects  sometimes it can be an acute problem  for example hypertensive emergency   levels of arterial pressure put mechanical stress on the arterial walls  higher pressures increase heart workload and progression of unhealthy tissue growth  atheroma  that develops within the walls of arteries  the higher the pressure  the more stress that is present and the more atheroma tend to progress and the heart muscle tends to thicken  enlarge and become weaker over time   persistent hypertension is one of the risk factors for strokes  heart attacks  heart failure and arterial aneurysms  and is the leading cause of chronic kidney failure  even moderate elevation of arterial pressure leads to shortened life expectancy  at severely high pressures  mean arterial pressures 50  or more above average  a person can expect to live no more than a few years unless appropriately treated  31   in the past  most attention was paid to diastolic pressure  but nowadays it is recognised that both high systolic pressure and high pulse pressure  the numerical difference between systolic and diastolic pressures  are also risk factors  in some cases  it appears that a decrease in excessive diastolic pressure can actually increase risk  due probably to the increased difference between systolic and diastolic pressures  see the article on pulse pressure   if systolic blood pressure is elevated (&gt 140\xa0mmhg  with a normal diastolic blood pressure (&lt 90\xa0mmhg   it is called  isolated systolic hypertension  and may present a health concern  32][33   for those with heart valve regurgitation  a change in its severity may be associated with a change in diastolic pressure  in a study of people with heart valve regurgitation that compared measurements 2 weeks apart for each person  there was an increased severity of aortic and mitral regurgitation when diastolic blood pressure increased  whereas when diastolic blood pressure decreased  there was a decreased severity  34   blood pressure that is too low is known as hypotension  hypotension is a medical concern if it causes signs or symptoms  such as dizziness  fainting  or in extreme cases  shock  9   when arterial pressure and blood flow decrease beyond a certain point  the perfusion of the brain becomes critically decreased  i e   the blood supply is not sufficient   causing lightheadedness  dizziness  weakness or fainting  35   sometimes the arterial pressure drops significantly when a patient stands up from sitting  this is known as orthostatic hypotension  postural hypotension   gravity reduces the rate of blood return from the body veins below the heart back to the heart  thus reducing stroke volume and cardiac output  citation needed   when people are healthy  the veins below their heart quickly constrict and the heart rate increases to minimize and compensate for the gravity effect  this is carried out involuntarily by the autonomic nervous system  the system usually requires a few seconds to fully adjust and if the compensations are too slow or inadequate  the individual will suffer reduced blood flow to the brain  dizziness and potential blackout  increases in g-loading  such as routinely experienced by aerobatic or combat pilots  pulling gs   greatly increases this effect  repositioning the body perpendicular to gravity largely eliminates the problem  citation needed   other causes of low arterial pressure include  citation needed   shock is a complex condition which leads to critically decreased perfusion  the usual mechanisms are loss of blood volume  pooling of blood within the veins reducing adequate return to the heart and or low effective heart pumping  low arterial pressure  especially low pulse pressure  is a sign of shock and contributes to and reflects decreased perfusion   if there is a significant difference in the pressure from one arm to the other  that may indicate a narrowing  for example  due to aortic coarctation  aortic dissection  thrombosis or embolism  of an artery  citation needed   normal fluctuation in blood pressure is adaptive and necessary  fluctuations in pressure that are significantly greater than the norm are associated with greater white matter hyperintensity  a finding consistent with reduced local cerebral blood flow 36  and a heightened risk of cerebrovascular disease  37  within both high and low blood pressure groups  a greater degree of fluctuation was found to correlate with an increase in cerebrovascular disease compared to those with less variability  suggesting the consideration of the clinical management of blood pressure fluctuations  even among normotensive older adults  37  older individuals and those who had received blood pressure medications were more likely to exhibit larger fluctuations in pressure  37   during each heartbeat  blood pressure varies between a maximum  systolic  and a minimum  diastolic  pressure  38  the blood pressure in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart  39  differences in mean blood pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation  the rate of mean blood flow depends on both blood pressure and the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels  mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood moves away from the heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy  mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation  although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles  40  gravity affects blood pressure via hydrostatic forces  e g   during standing   and valves in veins  breathing  and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence blood pressure in veins  39   most influences on blood pressure can be understood in terms of their effect on cardiac output and resistance  the determinants of mean arterial pressure   41   some factors are   in practice  each individual s autonomic nervous system and other systems regulating blood pressure respond to and regulate all these factors so that  although the above issues are important  they rarely act in isolation and the actual arterial pressure response of a given individual can vary widely in the short and long-term   the endogenous regulation of arterial pressure is not completely understood  but the following mechanisms of regulating arterial pressure have been well-characterized   these different mechanisms are not necessarily independent of each other  as indicated by the link between the ras and aldosterone release  when blood pressure falls many physiological cascades commence in order to return the blood pressure to a more appropriate level   currently  the ras is targeted pharmacologically by ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor antagonists  the aldosterone system is directly targeted by spironolactone  an aldosterone antagonist  the fluid retention may be targeted by diuretics  the antihypertensive effect of diuretics is due to its effect on blood volume  generally  the baroreceptor reflex is not targeted in hypertension because if blocked  individuals may suffer from orthostatic hypotension and fainting   arterial pressure is most commonly measured via a sphygmomanometer  which historically used the height of a column of mercury to reflect the circulating pressure  49  blood pressure values are generally reported in millimetres of mercury  mmhg   though aneroid and electronic devices do not contain mercury   for each heartbeat  blood pressure varies between systolic and diastolic pressures  systolic pressure is peak pressure in the arteries  which occurs near the end of the cardiac cycle when the ventricles are contracting  diastolic pressure is minimum pressure in the arteries  which occurs near the beginning of the cardiac cycle when the ventricles are filled with blood  an example of normal measured values for a resting  healthy adult human is 120\xa0mmhg systolic and 80\xa0mmhg diastolic  written as 120/80\xa0mmhg  and spoken as  one-twenty over eighty     systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures are not static but undergo natural variations from one heartbeat to another and throughout the day  in a circadian rhythm   they also change in response to stress  nutritional factors  drugs  disease  exercise  and momentarily from standing up  sometimes the variations are large  hypertension refers to arterial pressure being abnormally high  as opposed to hypotension  when it is abnormally low  along with body temperature  respiratory rate  and pulse rate  blood pressure is one of the four main vital signs routinely monitored by medical professionals and healthcare providers  50   measuring pressure invasively  by penetrating the arterial wall to take the measurement  is much less common and usually restricted to a hospital setting   in pregnancy  it is the fetal heart and not the mother s heart that builds up the fetal blood pressure to drive blood through the fetal circulation  the blood pressure in the fetal aorta is approximately 30\xa0mmhg at 20 weeks of gestation  and increases to approximately 45\xa0mmhg at 40 weeks of gestation  51   the average blood pressure for full-term infants  52
