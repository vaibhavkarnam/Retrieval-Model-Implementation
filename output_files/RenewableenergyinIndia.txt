 renewable energy in india comes under the purview of the ministry of new and renewable energy  mnre   newer renewable electricity sources are targeted to grow massively by 2022  including a more than doubling of india s large wind power capacity and an almost 15 fold increase in solar power from april 2016 levels  such ambitious targets would place india amongst the world leaders in renewable energy use and place india at the centre of its international solar alliance project promoting the growth and development of solar power internationally to over 120 countries   india was the first country in the world to set up a ministry of non-conventional energy resources  in early 1980s  as of september 30  2016 india s cumulative grid interactive or grid tied renewable energy capacity  excluding large hydro  reached about 44.24 gw  1][2][3  61  of the renewable power came from wind  while solar contributed nearly 19%.[4][5  large hydro installed capacity was 43.11 gw 1  as of september 30  2016 and is administered separately by the ministry of power and not included in mnre targets   from 2015 onwards the mnre began laying down actionable plans for the renewable energy sector under its ambit to make a quantum jump  building on strong foundations already established in the country  6  mnre renewable electrictricity targets have been upscaled to grow from just under 43 gw in april 2016 to 175 gw by the year 2022  including 100 gw from solar power  60 gw from wind power  10 gw from bio power and 5 gw from small hydro power  6  the ambitious targets would see india quickly becoming one of the leading green energy producers in the world and surpassing numerous developed countries  the government intends to achieve 40  cumulative electric power capacity from non fossil fuel sources by 2030.[6         the target is given for  bio-power  which includes biomass power and waste to power generation   the figures above refer to newer and fast developing renewable energy sources and are managed by the ministry for new and renewable energy  mnre   in addition as of dec 31  2016 india had 50,017.97 mw of installed large hydro capacity  which comes under the ambit of ministry of power  1   in terms of meeting its ambitious 2022 targets  as of april 30  2016  wind power was almost half way towards its goal  whilst solar power was below 7  of its highly ambitious target  although expansion is expected to be dramatic in the near future  bio energy was also at just under half way towards its target whilst small hydro  power was already 85  of the way to meeting its target  overall india was 24.5  towards meeting its final 2022 renewable power installed power capacitiy of 175 gw  the total breakdown of installed grid connected capacity from all sources including large hydro was as follows   the first figure at the top of the table refers to the fast growing renewable energy sources under the responsibility of the ministry for new and renewable energy and slightly exceeded the installed capacity of large hydro installations  this figure is targeted to reach 175 gw by 2022  coal power currently represents the largest share of installed capacity at just under 186 gw  total installed capacity as of april 30  2016  for grid connected power in india stood at a little under 303 gw  1   -rural  -industrial  18.15  164.24  in addition to grid connected renewable electricity india had 1,347.29 mw eq  of off grid renewable energy sources as well as 48.6 lakhs of family biogas plants by 31 july 2016.[3   the development of wind power in india began in the 1990s  and has significantly increased in the last few years  although a relative newcomer to the wind industry compared with denmark or the us  domestic policy support for wind power has led india to become the country with the fourth largest installed wind power capacity in the world  9   as of march 31  2016 the installed capacity of wind power in india was 26,769.05 mw  3  mainly spread across tamil nadu (7,269.50 mw   maharashtra (4,100.40 mw   gujarat (3,454.30 mw   rajasthan (2,784.90 mw   karnataka (2,318.20 mw   andhra pradesh (746.20 mw  and madhya pradesh (423.40 mw  10  wind power accounts for 14  of india s total installed power capacity  11  india has set an ambitious target to generate 60,000 mw of electricity from wind power by 2022.[12   some of india s largest wind farms are   india is densely populated and has high solar insolation  an ideal combination for using solar power in india  much of the country does not have an electrical grid  so one of the first applications of solar power has been for water pumping  to begin replacing india s four to five million diesel powered water pumps  each consuming about 3.5\xa0kilowatts  and off-grid lighting  some large projects have been proposed  and a 35,000\xa0km xb2 area of the thar desert has been set aside for solar power projects  sufficient to generate 700 to 2,100\xa0gigawatts   the indian solar loan programme  supported by the united nations environment programme has won the prestigious energy globe world award for sustainability for helping to establish a consumer financing program for solar home power systems  over the span of three years more than 16,000 solar home systems have been financed through 2,000 bank branches  particularly in rural areas of south india where the electricity grid does not yet extend  21][22   launched in 2003  the indian solar loan programme was a four-year partnership between unep  the unep risoe centre  and two of india s largest banks  the canara bank and syndicate bank  22   announced in november 2009  the government of india proposed to launch its jawaharlal nehru national solar mission under the national action plan on climate change with plans to generate 1,000\xa0mw of power by 2013 and up to 20,000\xa0mw grid-based solar power  2,000\xa0mw of off-grid solar power and cover 20 million sq metres with collectors by the end of the final phase of the mission in 2020.[23  the mission aims to achieve grid parity  electricity delivered at the same cost and quality as that delivered on the grid  by 2020  achieving this target would establish india as a global leader in solar power generation  24   indian electrical and electronics manufacturers association  ieema  plays a major role in renewable energy  every year  about 55 million tonnes of municipal solid waste  msw  and 38 billion litres of sewage are generated in the urban areas of india  in addition  large quantities of solid and liquid wastes are generated by industries  waste generation in india is expected to increase rapidly in the future  as more people migrate to urban areas and as incomes increase  consumption levels are likely to rise  as are rates of waste generation  it is estimated that the amount of waste generated in india will increase at a per capita rate of approximately 1-1.33  annually  this has significant impacts on the amount of land that is and will be needed for disposal  economic costs of collecting and transporting waste  and the environmental consequences of increased msw generation levels  waste energy in india 25   india has had a long involvement with anaerobic digestion and biogas technologies  waste water treatment plants in the country have been established which produce renewable energy from sewage gas  however there is significant un-tapped potential  26  also wastes from the distillery sector are on some sites converted into biogas to run in a gas engine to generate onsite power   types of waste waste can be broadly classified into  prominent companies in the waste to energy sector  [27    media related to renewable energy in india at wikimedia commons
