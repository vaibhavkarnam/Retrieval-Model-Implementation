Wasteheatrecoveryunit
 a waste heat recovery unit  whru  is an energy recovery heat exchanger that recovers heat from hot streams with potential high energy content  such as hot flue gases from a diesel generator or steam from cooling towers or even waste water from different cooling processes such as in steel cooling       waste heat found in the exhaust gas of various processes or even from the exhaust stream of a conditioning unit can be used to preheat the incoming gas  this is one of the basic methods for recovery of waste heat  many steel making plants use this process as an economic method to increase the production of the plant with lower fuel demand  nthere are many different commercial recovery units for the transferring of energy from hot medium space to lower one  1   particulate filters  dpf  to capture emission by maintaining higher temperatures adjacent to the converter and tail pipes to reduce the amount of emissions from the exhaust  according to a report done by energetics incorporated for the doe in november 2004 titled technology roadmap 2  and several others done by the european commission  the majority of energy production from conventional and renewable resources are lost to the atmosphere due to onsite  equipment inefficiency and losses due to waste heat  and offsite  cable and transformers losses  losses  that sums to be around 66  loss in electricity value  3  waste heat of different degrees could be found in final products of a certain process or as a by-product in industry such as the slag in steelmaking plants  units or devices that could recover the waste heat and transform it into electricity are called whrus or heat to power units  for example  an organic rankine cycle unit uses an organic fluid as the working fluid  the fluid has a lower boiling point than water to allow it to boil at low temperature  to form a superheated gas that could drive the blade of a turbine and thus a generator  thermoelectric  seebeck  peltier  thomson effects  units may also be called whru  since they use the heat differential between two plates to produce dc power   shape-memory alloys can also be used to recover low temperature waste heat and convert it to mechanical action or electricity  citation needed   a whrb is different from a heat recovery steam generator  hrsg  in the sense that the heated medium does not change phase   advantages   these systems have many benefits which could be direct or indirect   disadvantages   the cyclone waste heat engine is designed to generate electricity from recovered waste heat energy using a steam cycle  8   international wastewater systems is another company addressing waste heat recovery systems  focused on multi-unit residential  publicly shared buildings  industrial applications and district energy systems  their systems use the energy in waste water for domestic hot water production  building space heating and cooling  9   motorsport series formula one introduced waste heat recovery units in 2014 under the name mgu-h   waste heat recovery unit based on organic rankine cycle  enerbasque  http   www enerbasque com
