 george andrew olah  born ol xe1h gy xf6rgy  may 22  1927 \u2013 march 8  2017  was a hungarian and american chemist  his research involved the generation and reactivity of carbocations via superacids  for this research  olah was awarded a nobel prize in chemistry in 1994  for his contribution to carbocation chemistry   3  he was also awarded the priestley medal  the highest honor granted by the american chemical society and f a  cotton medal for excellence in chemical research of the american chemical society in 1996.[4][5][6][7       olah was born in budapest  hungary  on may 22  1927  to magda  krasznai  and gyula ol xe1h  a lawyer  8][9  after the high school of budapesti piarista gimnazium  scolopi fathers   he studied under organic chemist g xe9za zempl xe9n at the technical university of budapest  now the budapest university of technology and economics  where he earned m s  and ph d degrees in chemical engineering  10  from 1949 through 1954  he taught at the school as a professor of organic chemistry  11  in the subsequent two years  from 1954\u20131956  he worked at the research institute of the hungarian academy of sciences  where he was associate scientific director and head of the department of organic chemistry  11   as a result of the 1956 hungarian revolution  he and his family moved briefly to england and then to canada  where he joined dow chemical in sarnia  ontario  with another hungarian chemist  stephen j  kuhn  olah s pioneering work on carbocations started during his eight years with dow  12  in 1965  he returned to academia at case western reserve university in cleveland  ohio  chairing the department of chemistry from 1965 to 1969  and from 1967 through 1977 he was the c  f  maybery distinguished professor of research in chemistry  11  in 1971  olah became a naturalized citizen of the united states  10  he then moved to the university of southern california in 1977.[10   at usc  olah was a distinguished professor and the director of the loker hydrocarbon research institute  13  starting in 1980  he served as the distinguished donald p  and katherine b  loker professor of chemistry and later became a distinguished professor in usc s school of engineering  10  in 1994  olah was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry  for his contribution to carbocation chemistry   14  in particular  olah s search for stable nonclassical carbocations led to the discovery of protonated methane stabilized by superacids  like fso3h-sbf5   magic acid     because these cations were able to be stabilized  scientists could now use infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance  nmr  spectroscopy to study them in greater depth  as well as use them as catalysts in organic synthesis reactions  15   olah  with canadian chemist saul winstein  was also involved in a career-long battle with herbert c  brown of purdue over the existence of so-called  nonclassical  carbocations \u2013 such as the norbornyl cation  which can be depicted as cationic character delocalized over several bonds  16  olah s studies of the cation with nmr spectroscopy provided more evidence suggesting that winstein s model of the non-classical cation   featuring a pair of  delocalized  electrons smeared between three carbon atoms   was correct  17   in 1997  the olah family formed an endowment fund  the george a  olah endowment  which grants annual awards to outstanding chemists  including the george a  olah award in hydrocarbon or petroleum chemistry  formerly known as the acs award in petroleum chemistry  the awards are selected and administered by the american chemical society  18   later in his career  his research shifted from hydrocarbons and their transformation into fuel to the methanol economy  namely generating methanol from methane  19  he joined with robert zubrin  anne korin  and james woolsey in promoting a flexible-fuel mandate initiative  20][21][22  in 2005  olah wrote an essay promoting the methanol economy in which he suggested that methanol could be produced from hydrogen gas (h2  and industrially derived or atmospheric carbon dioxide (co2   using energy from renewable sources to power the production process  23   he married judith agnes lengyel in 1949  and they had two children  george  born in hungary in 1954  and ronald  born in the u s  in 1959.[10  olah died on march 8  2017  at his home in beverly hills  california  24][25  after his death  the hungarian government said that the  country has lost a great patriot and one of the most outstanding figures of hungarian scientific life   24
