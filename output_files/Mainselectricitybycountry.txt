 mains electricity by country includes a list of countries and territories  with the plugs  voltages and frequencies they use for providing electrical power to small appliances and some major appliances  every country has differing rules regarding distribution of electricity for portable appliances and lighting  voltage  frequency  and plug type vary widely  but large regions may use common standards  physical compatibility of receptacles may not ensure compatibility of voltage  frequency  or connection to earth ground   this article lists the plug type  voltage and frequency commonly expected for many territories  in some areas  older standards may still exist  foreign enclaves or buildings frequented by tourists may support plugs not otherwise used in a country  for the convenience of travellers       the international electrotechnical commission publishes a web microsite world plugs 1  unreliable source   which provides the main source for this page  except where other sources are indicated  world plugs includes some history  a description of plug types  and a list of countries giving the type s  used and the mains voltage and frequency   although useful for quick reference  especially for travellers  iec world plugs may not be regarded as totally accurate  as illustrated by the examples in the plugs section below  and errors may exist  such as indonesia being listed as using both 220 v and 110 v when the indonesian standard spln 1[2  clearly states the voltage as 230 v   a plug is defined in iec 60050 as an accessory having pins designed to engage with the contacts of a socket-outlet  also incorporating means for the electrical connection and mechanical retention of flexible cables or cords  a plug does not contain components which modify the electrical output from the electrical input  except where a switch and or fuse is provided as a means of disconnecting the output from input   informally  power conversion devices with incorporated plug pins may be also called  plugs   but iec 60050 refers to these as  direct plug-in equipment  defined as equipment in which the mains plug forms an integral part of the equipment enclosure so that the equipment is supported by the mains socket-outlet  in this article  the term  plug  is used in the sense defined by iec 60050   the types used in each country are set by national standards  some of which are listed in the iec technical report tr 60083  plugs and socket-outlets for domestic and similar general use standardized in member countries of iec  3   the international standard iec 60884-1 defines the general requirements for plugs and sockets intended for household and similar purposes  iec 60884-1 does not define specific plug and socket types  which are the subject of national standards in each country  iec 60884-1 para 9.2 does stipulate that  it shall not be possible  within a given system  to engage a plug with a socket-outlet having a higher voltage rating or a lower current rating  iec 60884-1 para 6.1 defines the preferred voltage ratings for single phase plugs and sockets as 130 v or 250 v  in the foreword of iec 60884-1 it states  in order to promote international uniformity  iec national committees undertake to apply iec publications transparently to the maximum extent possible in their national and regional publications  any divergence between any iec publication and the corresponding national or regional publication shall be clearly indicated in the latter  4   the lettering system used here is from world plugs  which defines the letter names and gives a  not always correct  list of what plug types are used where  type a makes specific reference to american and japanese plugs  as does type b  which is specifically rated at 15\xa0a  type c is specifically identified as the europlug  which is defined in en xa050075  and described as a plug which fits into any socket that accepts 4.0\u20134.8\xa0mm round contacts on xa019\xa0mm centres  type d is specifically rated at 5 a  type e  grounding pin in socket  and type f  grounding clips on both sides  are specifically rated at 16\xa0a and defined as having 4.8\xa0mm pins on 19\xa0mm centres  type g is identified as the fused british plug  the type h plug is described as unique to israel  type i  australian  is described as having both 10\xa0a and 15\xa0a ratings  type j  swiss  is rated at 10\xa0a and is differentiated from type n  the type k rating is not shown  the type l  italian  description includes both ratings and pin sizes  type m is described as looking similar to type d  but with much larger pins  the type n description is of the two variations of brazilian plug  brazilian national standard nbr 14136   however  the original plug and socket is defined in iec 60906-1 and has been adopted as a south african national standard  sans 164-2   the brazilian version is non-compliant with the iec standard  not all plugs are included in the letter system  for example  there is no designation for the plug defined by the thai national standard tis116-2549   iec world plugs is ambiguous in some areas  it does not reference national technical standards that define the dimensions and tolerances of devices  plugs will usually mate with sockets which are intended to accept plugs classified under the same letter type  but there is no guarantee of this  there is also an issue relating to type c  the en xa050075 europlug  which has no dedicated socket in the standard and is designed to fit sockets accepting "4.0\u20134.8\xa0mm round contacts on 19\xa0mm centres   implying that there must be usage of such sockets in the territories listed as using type c plugs  despite this  world plugs lists seven territories as using only type c  i e   no mention of specific plug types whose mating sockets also accept type c  and twenty-one territories using type c with no compatible types  5  this may be for a number of reasons  for instance the thai standard tis 166-2549 includes a socket which will also accept types a  b and c plugs as well as the thai plug  which does not have an iec classification letter   another possible reason is the use of so-called  universal sockets  in use in some countries  these accept multiple plug types but meet no standards and are not classified by the iec   the united states department of commerce published an earlier guide  6  which is now obsolescent and which has known inaccuracies   see history of similar guides section below    multi-standard sockets are sometimes used in china and some other asian countries  these are intended to accommodate plugs conforming to various different standards  they do not normally have earthing  grounding  connections for either cee 7/4  schuko   or cee 7/5  french   or their combination cee 7/7  in multi-standard sockets  the aperture size for nema plugs is often the same for both line  hot  and neutral  which allows a polarized plug to be inserted in either orientation  thus defeating the safety feature  also  in a socket designed to accept both nema and bs 1363 plugs  the polarization can only be correct for one type of plug  so only appliances which do not require specific polarization should be connected  7  multi-standard sockets made by lengon are amongst those classified as serious safety risks  because they allow the user to come into contact with live parts  8   thai socket which also accepts type a  b and c plugs   so-called  universal socket  which meets no standard but accepts a number of different plug types   adapters that allow insertion of otherwise mechanically incompatible plugs into sockets are useful for travellers  but  as with multi-standard sockets  may not ensure the grounding and polarization intended by a compatible system of plugs and sockets   plugs and power cords have a rated voltage  v  and rated current  a  assigned to them by the manufacturer  and these values are required to be marked on the plug  for a plug  the values are normally those specified in the relevant standard sheet  the international preferred rating for household plugs and sockets is either 130 v or 250 v  these are the values for normal use  and at which they are tested   plugs and power cords are also required to be tested at higher voltage for a brief period of 1 minute to test their electrical strength in case of fault conditions   9  the nema 1\u201315 u s  2 pin  type a  and nema 5\u201315 u s  3 pin  type b  plugs are rated at 125 v  10  similar plugs used in countries with higher mains voltages in the range 220\u2013250 v are rated at 250 v  11  using an appliance  plug or power cord which is not appropriate for the territory  e g  one rated for 125 v with a 230 v supply  may constitute a safety hazard   sockets connected to mains voltages above 125 v and which accept type a or b plugs may be suitable for chargers and power supplies incorporating type a pins  providing they have a suitable voltage rating   type i plugs also have differences in characteristics such as pin length  this means that the uninsulated pins of a chinese plug may become live while there is still a large enough gap between the faces of the plug and socket to allow a finger to touch the pin  argentinean connectors have the opposite polarity to those of other type i countries   national wiring regulations sometimes prohibit the use of sockets within certain areas adjacent to water taps etc  in such cases shaver supply units meeting iec xa061558-2-5 may be permissible  these include an isolation transformer and usually accept multiple two-pin plug types including europlug  type c   australian  type i  and bs xa04573  the isolation transformer often includes a 115\xa0v output accepting two-pin us plugs  type a   shaver supply units must also be current limited  iec xa061558-2-5 specifies a minimum rating of 20\xa0va and maximum of 50\xa0va  12  iec xa061558-2-5 requires sockets to be marked with the shaver symbol defined in iec xa060417-5225  the words  shavers only  are also often used but not required  iec xa061558-2-5 has been adopted as a european cenelec standard en xa061558-2-5 and also as a national standard in some countries  e g  uk (bs xa0en xa061558-2-5  and malaysia (ms xa0iec xa061558-2-5    voltages in this article are the nominal single-phase supply voltages  three-phase and industrial loads will have other voltages   all voltages are root mean square voltage  the peak ac voltage is greater by a factor of \u221a2  and the peak-to-peak voltage greater by a factor of 2\u221a2   in 1948 the us government printing office published world electric current characteristics  13  this contained information on voltages used in the cities of many countries  but no information on plugs  the guide was republished by the us department of commerce in 1954 as electric current abroad  this was updated from time to time and the 1967 version includes some information on plugs  14  however only 3 types were designated  type a  illustrated by a us style 2 pin plug  type b  illustrated by a sketch of a bs 546 type  and type c  illustrated by a sketch of a bs 1363 type  the 1984 edition 15  uses the letters a to g in the same manner as they are used today  the last printed edition  listing plugs from a to h  was that of 1998  reprinted in 2002,[6  it includes brief textual descriptions of each type illustrated by a sketch  only type f  described as a schuko  is specifically linked to a generally recognized type  the international trade administration of the us department of commerce now publishes a web version  electric current worldwide  which still does not include the full list of plug types  it does not describe type m or type n  there are sketches and photographs of each type  but no textual description or references to actual standards  examples of errors in the website include the failure to mention that brazil uses type n  although that has been the national standard in that country since 1998  stating that the uk uses type c  which is not permitted there  and claiming that china uses type h  the israeli plug  when the main chinese plug is actually type i   there are many web sites from unofficial sources which also purport to offer lists of voltages and plug types   except where other sources are indicated  the plug type  voltage and frequency in this table are sourced from an official web page of the iec world plugs 1  unreliable source    entries in the plug standard column refer to the national standards pertaining to the relevant territory  and unless otherwise stated are sourced from iec technical report 60083.[3
