RenewableenergyinAustralia
 renewable energy in australia deals with efforts being made in australia to quantify and expand renewable energy  which includes electricity  transport fuels and thermal energy  total renewable energy consumption in australia in 2015 was 346pj  representing 5.9  of australia s total energy consumption  1  this is an increase of 1.6  from 2011\u201312 levels (265pj   representing 4.3  of australia s total energy consumption  2  of all renewable energy consumption in 2015  in order of contribution  biomass  wood  woodwaste and bagasse  represents 53   hydroelectricity 19.2   wind 10.7   solar pv 5.1   biogas 4.7   solar hot water 3.8  and biofuels 3.6%.[3  bioenergy  the sum of all energy derived from plant matter  represented 61.3  (211.9pj  of australia s total renewable energy consumption in 2015.[3   renewable electricity has undergone substantial growth in australia in the 21st century  it is estimated that australia produced 35,007 gigawatt hours  gwh  of renewable electricity  or equivalent  over the year ending december 2015  representing 14.6  of the total production in australia  4  by way of comparison  in 2006  approximately 9,500\xa0gwh of electricity came from renewable sources  representing less than 4  of nationally generated electricity  5  citation needed   of all renewable electrical sources in 2012  hydroelectricity represented 57.8   wind 26   bioenergy 8.1   solar pv 8   large-scale solar 0.147   geothermal 0.002  and marine 0.001   additionally  solar hot water heating was estimated to replace a further 2,422\xa0gwh of electrical generation  6   similar to many other countries  development of renewable electricity in australia has been encouraged by government energy policy implemented in response to concerns about climate change  energy independence and economic stimulus  7  a key policy that has been in place since 2001 to encourage large-scale renewable energy development is a mandatory renewable energy target  which in 2010 was increased to 41,000\xa0gigawatt-hours of renewable generation from power stations  this was subsequently reduced to 33,000 gigawatt-hours by the abbott government with the agreement of the labor opposition  8  alongside this there is the small-scale renewable energy scheme  an uncapped scheme to support rooftop solar power and solar hot water 9  and several state schemes providing feed-in tariffs to encourage photovoltaics  in 2012  these policies were supplemented by a carbon price and a 10\xa0billion-dollar fund to finance renewable energy projects  10  although these initiatives were later withdrawn by the federal government  11   it has been suggested that with sufficient public and private sector investment and government policy certainty  australia could switch entirely to renewable energy within a decade by building additional large-scale solar and wind power developments  upgrading to transmission infrastructure and introduction of appropriate energy efficiency measures  7][12       australia has a very high potential for renewable energy  13  therefore  the transition to a renewable energy system is gaining momentum in the peer-reviewed scientific literature  14  among them several studies have examined the feasibility of a transition to a 100  renewable electricity systems  which was found both practicable as well as economically and environmentally beneficial to combat global warming  15][16][17   the snowy mountains scheme constructed between 1949 and 1974 consists of sixteen major dams and seven major power stations  and has a total generating capacity of 3,800\xa0mw  the scheme generates on average 4,500 gwh electricity per year  18   hydro tasmania operates thirty power stations and fifty dams  and has a total generating capacity of 2,600\xa0mw  each year an average of 9,000 gwh of hydro-electricity is generated by the company  19   in 2007\u201308 hydro-electricity represented 15  of renewable energy production in australia  20  in 2015 this had risen to 40  of renewable energy production  4   as of october 2010  around 22.9  of australia s renewable electricity  and 2  of australia s total electricity  was sourced from wind power  21  enough electricity to power more than 700,000 homes  22  this came from 52 operating wind farms containing a total of 1,052\xa0turbines producing approximately 5,000\xa0gwh of electricity per year  this figure represented approximately a 30  increase in wind power generation each year over the previous decade  or a total increase of more than 1,000  over that time  the total installed capacity as of october 2010 was 1,880\xa0mw  including only projects over 100\xa0kw   with a further 1,043\xa0mw under construction  22   wind power in south australia is a fast-growing industry as south australia is well suited for wind farms  consequently  more wind power is generated in south australia than any other australian state or territory  as of october 2010 south australia had an installed capacity of 907\xa0mw from 435\xa0turbines accounting for close to 20  of that state s electricity needs  considerably ahead of victoria with 428\xa0mw from 267\xa0turbines  and western australia with 202\xa0mw from 142\xa0turbines  22  by the end of 2011 wind power in south australia had risen to 26  of the state s electricity generation  edging out coal fired power for the first time  with only 7.2  of australia s population south australia had 54  of the nation s installed wind power capacity  23  adelaide s $a2.2\xa0billion desalination plant  capable of providing 50  of the city s water needs  is totally powered by renewable energy   the waubra wind farm near ballarat  victoria  completed in 2009  was the largest wind farm in the southern hemisphere  20  consisting of 128\xa0turbines spread over 173\xa0km2[22  and rated at 192\xa0mw  however  in terms of generating capacity lake bonney wind farm near millicent  south australia was the largest with 239.5\xa0mw  despite only having 99\xa0turbines  these figures have since been surpassed by the macarthur wind farm at macarthur  victoria  which opened in 2013 with a capacity of 420\xa0mw  22][24   solar photovoltaic  pv  technology generates electricity from sunlight  and it can be used in grid-connected and off-grid applications  they first become mass-produced in 2000  when german environmentalists and eurosolar succeeded in obtaining the government support for the 100,000 roofs program  25   the issue for the australian photovoltaics industry today is that there is enormous market potential  built up through a natural competitiveness in australian research and development  industry investment and government policy support  however  despite this  the industry is not yet self-sustaining and advantages gained to date could be lost  26  a 2004 market report suggested that a partnership between government and industry is necessary    the pv industry cannot continue to actively invest in strategic industry development unless the australian government is also committed to the journey  the industry     requires policy and program support to assist it in bridging the gap to mainstream commercial competitiveness   26   two recent projects which illustrate co-operation between industry and government are the solar power station planned for north-western victoria  and the development of new solar cells  queensland solar and lighting is a major importer of chinese and european solar products for the brisbane region in queensland  australia  27   many projects have demonstrated the feasibility of solar power in australia and a large new solar power station in victoria is planned   solar systems is to build the world s most advanced 28  photovoltaic  pv  heliostat solar concentrator power station in north-western victoria  the 154\xa0mw  a 420\xa0million project  will generate 270,000\xa0mwh per year  enough for more than 45,000 homes  it will aid in reducing salinity and create jobs during manufacture  construction and operation  it will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 400,000\xa0tonnes per year  29  full commissioning is expected in 2013  with the first stage to be completed in 2010.[30   the essential components of the power plant  developed by solar systems over the past 16\xa0years  are   the commercialisation of this technology has already seen four smaller solar power stations established in central australia  with support from the australian greenhouse office  31   sliver cell  tm  photovoltaic technology uses just one tenth of the costly and limited supply of silicon used in conventional solar panels while matching power  performance  and efficiency  32  professor andrew blakers  director of the australian national university centre for sustainable energy systems  invented the technology with colleague dr klaus weber and developed it with funding from energy supplier origin energy and the australian research council  blakers and weber won the australian institute of physics  walsh medal for their work  33  origin energy is presently developing sliver modules for commercialisation at its a 20m pilot plant in regency park  south australia  34   australia has developed world leading solar thermal technologies  but with only very low levels of actual use  domestic solar water heating is the most common solar thermal technology  35   during the 1950s  australia s commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation  csiro  carried out world leading research into flat plate solar water heaters  a solar water heater manufacturing industry was subsequently established in australia and a large proportion of the manufactured product was exported  four of the original companies are still in business and the manufacturing base has now expanded to 24 companies  despite an excellent solar resource  the penetration of solar water heaters in the australian domestic market was only about 5  in 2006  with new dwellings accounting for most sales  36  by 2014  around 14  of australian households had solar hot water installed [37   it is estimated that by installing a solar hot water system  it could reduce a family s co2 emissions up to 3\xa0tonnes per year while saving up to 80  of the energy costs for water heating  38   while solar water heating saves a significant amount of energy  they are generally omitted from measures of renewable energy production as they do not actually produce electricity  based on the installed base in australia as of october 2010  it was calculated that solar hot water units would account for about 7.4  of clean energy production if they were included in the overall figures  39   csiro s national solar energy centre in newcastle  nsw houses a 500\xa0kw  thermal  and a 1.5 mw  thermal  solar central receiver system  which are used as research and development facilities  40][41   the australian national university  anu  has worked on dish concentrator systems since the early 1970s and early work lead to the construction of the white cliffs solar thermal station  in 1994  the first  big dish  400\xa0m2 solar concentrator was completed on the anu campus  in 2005  wizard power pty ltd was established to commercialise the big dish technology to deployment  42  wizard power has built and demonstrated the 500m2 commercial big dish design in canberra and the whyalla solaroasis 43  will be the first commercial implementation of the technology  using 300 wizard power big dish solar thermal concentrators to deliver a 40mwe solar thermal power plant  44  construction is expected to commence in mid-late 2013   research activities at the university of sydney and university of new south wales have spun off into solar heat and power pty ltd  now ausra   which is currently building a major project at liddell power station in the hunter valley  the csiro division of energy technology has opened a major solar energy centre in newcastle that has a tower system purchased from solar heat and power and a prototype trough concentrator array developed in collaboration with the anu  42   cloncurry  a town in north-west queensland  has been chosen as the site for an innovative $31\xa0million  including a $7\xa0million government grant  solar thermal power station  the 10 mw solar thermal power station would deliver about 30\xa0million kilowatt hours of electricity a year  enough to power the whole town  ergon energy will develop the project which should be running by early 2010.[45][46   in august 2008 worley parsons  an australian engineering firm  announced plans to build world s biggest solar plant in australia within three years  backed by nine australian companies  including miners bhp billiton and rio tinto  they have launched a study into finding possible sites to host the $1\xa0billion plant  47   solar cities in australia is a $75\xa0million program which is designed to demonstrate how solar power  smart meters  energy conservation and new approaches to electricity pricing can combine to provide a sustainable energy future in urban locations throughout australia  it is a partnership approach that involves all levels of government  the private sector and the local community  adelaide  townsville  blacktown and alice springs are the first four solar cities announced in australia  48  consumers will be able to purchase solar photovoltaic panels using discounted loans  the project also plans to help low-income and rental households in the community share in the benefits of the project through other cost-saving initiatives  49   in australia  geothermal energy is a natural resource which is not utilised as a form of energy  however  there are known and potential locations near the centre of the country in which geothermal activity is detectable  exploratory geothermal wells have been drilled to test for the presence of high temperature geothermal activity and such high levels were detected  as a result  projects will eventuate in the coming years and more exploration is expected at potential locations   south australia has been described as  australia s hot rock haven  and this emissions free and renewable energy form could provide an estimated 6.8  of australia s base load power needs by 2030.[50  according to an estimate by the centre for international economics  australia has enough geothermal energy to contribute electricity for 450\xa0years  51   there are currently 19 companies australia-wide spending a 654\xa0million in exploration programmes in 141 areas  in south australia  which is expected to dominate the sector s growth  12 companies have already applied for 116 areas and can be expected to invest a 524\xa0million (us 435 m  in their projects by the next six years  ten projects are expected to achieve successful exploration and heat flows  by 2010  with at least three power generation demonstration projects coming on stream by 2012.[50   a geothermal power plant is generating 80\xa0kw of electricity at birdsville  in southwest queensland  52   several projects for harvesting the power of the ocean are under development   biofuels produced from food crops have become controversial as food prices increased significantly in mid-2008  leading to increased concerns about food vs fuel  ethanol fuel in australia can be produced from sugarcane or grains and there are currently three commercial producers of fuel ethanol in australia  all on the east coast   legislation imposes a 10  cap on the concentration of fuel ethanol blends  blends of 90  unleaded petrol and 10  fuel ethanol are commonly referred to as e10,[54  which is mainly available through service stations operating under the bp  caltex  shell  and united brands   in partnership with the queensland government  the canegrowers organisation launched a regional billboard campaign in march 2007 to promote the renewable fuels industry  over 100\xa0million litres of the new bp unleaded with renewable ethanol has now been sold to queensland motorists  54   biodiesel produced from oilseed crops or recycled cooking oil may be a better prospect than ethanol  given the nation s heavy reliance on road transport  and the growing popularity of fuel-efficient diesel cars  55  australian cities are some of the most car-dependent cities in the world  56  and legislations involving vehicle pollution within the country are considered relatively lax  57   biomass can be used directly for electricity generation  for example by burning sugar cane waste  bagasse  as a fuel for thermal power generation in sugar mills  it can also be used to produce steam for industrial uses  cooking and heating  it can also be converted into a liquid or gaseous biofuel  58   in 2015 bagasse accounted for 26.1  (90.2pj  of australia s renewable energy consumption  while wood and woodwaste for another 26.9  (92.9pj   3   biomass for energy production was the subject of a federal government report in 2004.[59   bp has been involved in solar power since 1973 and its subsidiary  bp solar  is now one of the world s largest solar power companies with production facilities in the united states  spain  india and australia  60  bp solar is involved in the commercialisation of a long life deep cycle lead acid battery  jointly developed by the csiro and battery energy  which is ideally suited to the storage of electricity for renewable remote area power systems (raps   61   edwards first began manufacturing water heaters in australia in 1963  edwards is now an international organisation which is a leader in producing hot water systems for both domestic and commercial purposes using solar technology  edwards exports to asia  the pacific  the americas  europe  africa and the middle east  62   eurosolar was first formed in 1993  with an aim of providing photovoltaic systems to the masses  it focuses on solar power in multiple australian capitals  in cooperation with the clean energy council they continue to install panels all around australia   origin energy is active in the renewable energy arena  and has spent a number of years developing several wind farms in south australia  a solar cell business using technology invented by a team led by professor andrew blakers at the australian national university  34  and geothermal power via a minority shareholding stake in geodynamics  63   pacific hydro is an australian company that specialises in electricity generation using renewable energy  its focus is on hydroelectricity and wind power  power stations owned by pacific hydro include wind farms  codrington wind farm  challicum hills wind

hydro-electric authority  manages the snowy mountains scheme which generates on average around 4500 gigawatt hours of renewable energy each year  which represented around 74  of all renewable energy in the national electricity market in 2005  the scheme also diverts water for irrigation from the snowy river catchment west to the murray and murrumbidgee river systems   solahart manufactured its first solar water heater in 1953  and products currently manufactured by solahart include thermosiphon and split system solar and heat pump water heaters  these are marketed in 90 countries around the world and overseas sales represent 40  of total business  solahart has a market share of 50  in australia  64   solar systems was a leader in high concentration solar photovoltaic applications  65][66  and the company built a photovoltaic mildura solar concentrator power station  australia  67][68  this project will use innovative concentrator dish technology to power 45,000 homes  providing 270,000 mwh year for a 420\xa0million  69   solar systems has already completed construction of three concentrator dish power stations in the northern territory  at hermannsburg  yuendumu  and lajamanu  which together generate 1,555 mwh year (260 homes  going by the energy home ratio above   this represents a saving of 420,000\xa0litres of diesel fuel and 1550\xa0tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year  the total cost of the solar power station was "a 7m  offset by a grant from the australian and northern territory governments under their renewable remote power generation program   70  the price of diesel in remote areas is high due to added transportation costs  in 2017  retail diesel prices in remote areas of the northern territory averaged $1.90 per litre  the 420,000 litres of diesel per year saved by these power stations in the first decade of operation would thus have cost approximately $8,000,000   wind prospect developed the 46 mw canunda wind farm in south australia  which was commissioned in march 2005  a second south australian wind farm  mount millar wind farm  was commissioned in january 2006 and this provides a further 70 mw of generation  more recently  a third wind farm has reached financial close for wind prospect in south australia  this is the 95 mw hallett wind farm which is expected to be fully commissioned late in 2008   there are a number of government policies in place in australia that influence the development of renewable energy   a key policy encouraging the development of renewable energy in australia includes mandatory renewable energy target  mret  schemes at both commonwealth and state levels  in 2001  the howard government introduced an mret of 9,500 gwh of new renewable energy generation by 2010  this target has since been revised with the gillard government introducing in january 2011 an expanded target of 45,000 gwh of additional renewable energy between 2001 and 2020.[71  this mret has been split into a small scale renewable energy scheme  sres  and large scale renewable energy target  lret  components to ensure that adequate incentive exists for large scale grid connected renewable energy  72   a number of states have also implemented their own renewable energy targets independent of the commonwealth  for example  the victorian renewable energy target scheme  vret  mandated an additional 5  of victoria s  load for renewable generation   although this has since been replaced by the new australian government lret and sres targets  72  south australia achieved its target of 20  of renewable supply by 2014 three years ahead of schedule  i e  in 2011  and has subsequently established a new target of 33  to be achieved by 2020.[73   the renewable energy certificates registry  rec-registry  is an internet based registry system that is required by the australian renewable energy  electricity  act 2000  the act   74  the rec-registry is dedicated to  maintaining various registers  as set in the act   and facilitating the creation  registration  transfer and surrender of renewable energy certificates  recs    in 2012  the gillard government implemented a carbon price of $23 per tonne to be paid by 300 liable entities representing the highest business emitters in australia  the carbon price will increase to $25.40 per tonne by 2014\u201315  and then will be set by the market from 1 july 2015 onwards  75  it is expected that in addition to encouraging efficient use of electricity  pricing carbon will encourage investment in cleaner renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power  treasury modelling has projected that with a carbon price  energy from the renewables sector is likely to reach 40 percent of supply by 2050.[76   analysis of the first 6\xa0months of operation of the carbon tax have shown that there has been a drop in carbon emissions by the electricity sector  it has been observed that there has been a change in the mix of energy over this period  with less electricity being sourced from coal and more being produced by renewables such as hydro and wind power  77  the government at the time presented this analysis as an indicator that their policies to promote cleaner energy are working  77   the carbon pricing legislation was repealed by the tony abbott-led australian government on 17 july 2014.[78  since then  carbon emissions from the electricity sector have increased  79   the australian government has announced the creation of the new 10\xa0billion dollar clean energy finance corporation which will commence business in july 2013  the goal of this intervention is to overcome barriers to the mobilisation of capital by the renewable energy sector  it will make available two billion dollars a year for five years for the financing of renewable energy  energy efficiency and low emissions technologies projects in the latter stages of development  the government has indicated that the fund is expected to be financially self-sufficient producing a positive return on investment comparable to the long term bond rate  10][80   feed-in tariffs have been enacted on a state by state basis in australia to encourage investment in renewable energy by providing above commercial rates for electricity generated from sources such as rooftop photovoltaic panels or wind turbines  7  the schemes in place focus on residential scale infrastructure by having limits that effectively exclude larger scale developments such as wind farms  feed-in tariffs schemes in australia started at a premium  but have mechanisms by which the price paid for electricity decreases over time to be equivalent or below the commercial rate  7  all the schemes now in place in australia are  net  schemes whereby the householder is only paid for surplus electricity over and above what is actually used  in the past  new south wales and the australian capital territory enacted  gross  schemes whereby householders were entitled to be paid for 100  of renewable electricity generated on the premises  however these programs have now expired  in 2008 the council of australian governments  coag  agreed to harmonise the various state schemes and developed a set of national principles to apply to new schemes  81  leader of the australian greens  christine milne  has advocated a uniform national  gross  feed-in tariff scheme  however this proposal has not been enacted  82   there is dispute about the level of subsidies paid to the fossil fuel industry in australia   the australian conservation foundation  acf  argues that according to the definitions of the organisation for economic co-operation and development  oecd   fossil fuel production and use is subsidised in australia by means of direct payments  favourable tax treatment  and other actions  it is suggested these measures act as impediments to investment in renewable energy resources  83  analysis by the acf indicates that these provisions add up to a total annual subsidy of a 7.7\xa0billion  with the most significant component being the fuel tax credits program that rebates diesel fuel excise to many business users  84   this analysis is disputed by the institute of public affairs  ipa  who argue that the acf s definition of a subsidy differs from that of the oecd and that the fuel tax rebate schemes are in place to ensure that all producers are treated equally from a tax point of view  however  the ipa acknowledges that regardless of perceived issues with the acf analysis  some level of fossil fuel subsidy is likely in existence  85   australia ratified the kyoto protocol in december 2007 under the then newly elected prime minister kevin rudd  evidence suggests australia will meet its targets required under this protocol  australia had not ratified the kyoto protocol until then  due to concerns over a loss of competitiveness with the us  which also rejects the treaty  86   survey results suggest that there is considerable public support for the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency in australia  in one recent survey  74  of respondents favoured a  greenhouse strategy based mainly on energy efficiency and renewable energy  and 19  favoured an  approach that focuses mainly on nuclear power and clean coal technologies   87   the australian results from the 1st annual world environment review  based on a survey of 1,007 people in 2007  found that  88   there is a considerable movement known as the transition decade to transition australia s entire energy system to renewable by 2020   voluntary uptake of greenpower  a government program initiated in 1997 whereby people can pay extra for electricity that is generated from renewable sources  increased from 132,300 customers in 2005 to 904,716 customers in 2009.[89   the percentage of renewable resources that could be achieved by 2020 has evolved from 25  in 2007 to 100  in 2010   david spratt and phillip sutton argue in their book climate code red that australia  as part of a concerted global effort  needs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions down to zero as quickly as possible so that carbon dioxide can be drawn down from the atmosphere and greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced to less than 325\xa0ppm co2-e  which they argue is the upper  safe climate  level at which we can continue developing infinitely  they outline a plan of action which would accomplish this  93   recently an uptake of third party ownership models for small to mid-scale solar photovoltaic systems has been seen in australia mirroring developments in the same direction in the us with over 70  of all new pv systems installed under such models in california  colorado and arizona  97  in australia the solar power purchase agreement approach is pursued under the term solar sponsoring 98    media related to renewable energy in australia at wikimedia commons
