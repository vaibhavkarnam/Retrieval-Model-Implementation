Energycrop
 an energy crop is a plant grown as a low-cost and low-maintenance harvest used to make biofuels  such as bioethanol  or combusted for its energy content to generate electricity or heat  energy crops are generally categorized as woody or herbaceous plants  many of the latter are grasses of the family graminaceae   commercial energy crops are typically densely planted  high-yielding crop species which are processed to bio-fuel and burnt to generate power  woody crops such as willow 1  or poplar are widely utilised  as well as temperate grasses such as miscanthus and pennisetum purpureum  both known as elephant grass   2  if carbohydrate content is desired for the production of biogas  whole-crops such as maize  sudan grass  millet  white sweet clover and many others  can be made into silage and then converted into biogas  3   through genetic modification and application of biotechnology plants can be manipulated to create greater yields  reduce associated costs and require less water  high energy yield can also be realized with existing cultivars  3]:250      energy generated by burning plants grown for the purpose  often after the dry matter is pelletized  energy crops are used for firing power plants  either alone or co-fired with other fuels  alternatively they may be used for heat or combined heat and power  chp  production   to cover the increasing requirements of woody biomass  short rotation coppice  src  were applied to agricultural sites  within this cropping systems fast growing tree species like willows and poplars are planted in growing cycles of three to five years  the cultivation of this cultures is dependent on wet soil conditions and could be an alternative for moist field sieds  however  an influence on local water conditions could not be excluded  this indicates that an establishment should exclude the vicinity to vulnarable wetland ecosystems  4][5][6   anaerobic digesters or biogas plants can be directly supplemented with energy crops once they have been ensiled into silage  the fastest growing sector of german biofarming has been in the area of  renewable energy crops  on nearly 500,000\xa0ha (1,200,000 acres  of land (2006).[7  energy crops can also be grown to boost gas yields where feedstocks have a low energy content  such as manures and spoiled grain  it is estimated that the energy yield presently of bioenergy crops converted via silage to methane is about 2\xa0gwh km2 (1.8\xd71010\xa0btu sq xa0mi   small mixed cropping enterprises with animals can use a portion of their acreage to grow and convert energy crops and sustain the entire farms energy requirements with about one fifth of the acreage  in europe and especially germany  however  this rapid growth has occurred only with substantial government support  as in the german bonus system for renewable energy  similar developments of integrating crop farming and bioenergy production via silage-methane have been almost entirely overlooked in n  america  where political and structural issues and a huge continued push to centralize energy production has overshadowed positive developments  citation needed   european production of biodiesel from energy crops has grown steadily in the last decade  principally focused on rapeseed used for oil and energy  production of oil biodiesel from rape covers more than 12,000\xa0km xb2 in germany alone  and has doubled in the past 15 years  8  typical yield of oil as pure biodiesel may be is 100,000\xa0l km2 (68,000\xa0us xa0gal sq xa0mi  57,000\xa0imp xa0gal sq xa0mi  or more  making biodiesel crops economically attractive  provided sustainable crop rotations exist that are nutrient-balanced and preventative of the spread of disease such as clubroot  biodiesel yield of soybeans is significantly lower than that of rape  citation needed   energy crops for biobutanol are grasses  two leading non-food crops for the production of cellulosic bioethanol are switchgrass and giant miscanthus  there has been a preoccupation with cellulosic bioethanol in america as the agricultural structure supporting biomethane is absent in many regions  with no credits or bonus system in place  citation needed  consequently  a lot of private money and investor hopes are being pinned on marketable and patentable innovations in enzyme hydrolysis and the like   bioethanol also refers to the technology of using principally corn  maize seed  to make ethanol directly through fermentation  a process that under certain field and process conditions can consume as much energy as is the energy value of the ethanol it produces  therefore being non-sustainable  new developments in converting grain stillage  referred to as distillers grain stillage or dgs  into biogas energy looks promising as a means to improve the poor energy ratio of this type of bioethanol process   dedicated energy crops are non-food energy crops as giant miscanthus  switchgrass  jatropha  fungi  and algae  dedicated energy crops are promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced in many regions of the united states  9   additionally  the green waste byproducts of food and non-food energy crops can be used to produce various biofuels
