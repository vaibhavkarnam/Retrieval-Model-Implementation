 carbon dioxide removal  cdr  methods refers to a number of technologies which reduce the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  1  among such technologies are bio-energy with carbon capture and storage  biochar  direct air capture  ocean fertilization and enhanced weathering  1  cdr is a different approach than removing co2 from the stack emissions of large fossil fuel point sources  such as power stations  the latter reduces emission to the atmosphere but cannot reduce the amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere  as cdr removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  it creates negative emissions  offsetting emissions from small and dispersed point sources such as domestic heating systems  airplanes and vehicle exhausts  2][3  it is regarded by some as a form of climate engineering  1  while other commentators describe it as a form of carbon capture and storage or extreme mitigation  4  whether cdr would satisfy common definitions of  climate engineering  or  geoengineering  usually depends upon the scale on which it would be undertaken   the likely need for cdr has been publicly expressed by a range of individuals and organizations involved with climate change issues  including ipcc chief rajendra pachauri  5  the unfccc executive secretary christiana figueres  6  and the world watch institute  7  institutions with major programs focusing on cdr include the lenfest center for sustainable energy at the earth institute  columbia university  8  and the climate decision making center  9  an international collaboration operated out of carnegie-mellon university s department of engineering and public policy   the mitigation effectiveness of air capture is limited by societal investment  land use  availability of geologic reservoirs  and leakage  the reservoirs are estimated to be sufficient to for storing at least 545 gtc  10  storing 771 gtc would cause an 186 ppm atmospheric reduction  11  in order to return the atmospheric co2 content to 350 ppm we need atmospheric reduction of 50 ppm plus an additional 2 ppm per year of current emissions       bio-energy with carbon capture and storage  or beccs  uses biomass to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  and carbon capture and storage technologies to concentrate and permanently store it in deep geological formations   beccs is currently  as of october 2012  the only cdr technology deployed at full industrial scale  with 550 000 tonnes co2 year in total capacity operating  divided between three different facilities  as of january 2012).[12][13][14][15][16   the imperial college london  the uk met office hadley centre for climate prediction and research  the tyndall centre for climate change research  the walker institute for climate system research  and the grantham institute for climate change issued a joint report on carbon dioxide removal technologies as part of the avoid  avoiding dangerous climate change research program  stating that  overall  of the technologies studied in this report  beccs has the greatest maturity and there are no major practical barriers to its introduction into today u2019s energy system  the presence of a primary product will support early deployment   17   according to the oecd   achieving lower concentration targets (450 ppm  depends significantly on the use of beccs   18   biochar is created by the pyrolysis of biomass  and is under investigation as a method of carbon sequestration  biochar is a charcoal that is used for agricultural purposes which also aids in carbon sequestration  the capture or hold of carbon  it is created using a process called pyrolysis  which is basically the act of high temperature heating biomass in an environment with low oxygen levels  what remains is a material known as char  similar to charcoal but is made through a sustainable process  thus the use of biomass  19  biomass is organic matter produced by living organisms or recently living organisms  most commonly plants or plant based material  20  the offset of ghg emission  if biochar were to be implemented  would be a maximum of 12   this equates to about 106 metric tons of co2 equivalents  on a medium conservative level  it would be 23  less than that  at 82 metric tons  21  a study done by the uk biochar research center has stated that  on a conservative level  biochar can store 1 gigaton of carbon per year  with greater effort in marketing and acceptance of biochar  the benefit would the storage of 5-9 gigatons per year of carbon in biochar soils  22   enhanced weathering refers to chemical approach to remove carbon dioxide involving land or ocean based techniques  examples of land based enhanced weathering techniques are in-situ carbonation of silicates  ultramafic rock  for example  has the potential to store thousands of years worth of co2 emissions according to one estimate  citation needed  ocean based techniques involve alkalinity enhancement  such as  grinding  dispersing and dissolving olivine  limestone  silicates  or calcium hydroxide to address ocean acidification and co2 sequestration  enhanced weathering is considered as one of the least expensive of geoengineering options  one example of a research project on the feasibility of enhanced weathering is the carbfix project in iceland  citation needed   carbon dioxide can be removed from ambient air through chemical processes  sequestered  and stored  one proposed method is by so-called artificial trees  23][24  this concept  proposed by climate scientist wallace s  broecker and science writer robert kunzig  25  imagines huge numbers of artificial trees around the world to remove ambient co2  the technology is now being pioneered by klaus lackner  a researcher at the earth institute  columbia university  26  whose artificial tree technology can suck up to 1,000 times more co2 from the air than real trees can  citation needed  at a rate of about one ton of carbon per day if the artificial tree is approximately the size of an actual tree  27][28  the co2 would be captured in a filter and then removed from the filter and stored    nthe chemistry used is a variant of that described below  as it is based on sodium hydroxide  however  in a more recent design proposed by klaus lackner  the process can be carried out at only 40\xa0\xb0c by using a polymer-based ion exchange resin  which takes advantage of changes in humidity to prompt the release of captured co2  instead of using a kiln  this reduces the energy required to operate the process  29   another substance which can be used are metal-organic frameworks  or mof s   30  a special mof has been made specifically for locking co2 by joeri denayer  31   in 2008  the discovery channel covered 32  the work of david keith  33  of university of calgary  who built a tower  4 feet wide and 20 feet tall (1.2\xd76.1 meters   with a fan at the bottom that sucks air in  which comes out again at the top  in the process  about half the co2 is removed from the air   this device uses the chemical process described in detail below  the system demonstrated on the discovery channel was a 1/90,000th scale test system of the capture section  the reagents are regenerated in a separate facility  the main costs of a full plant will be the cost to build it  and the energy input to regenerate the chemicals and produce a pure stream of co2   to put this into perspective  people in the u s  emit about 20 tonnes of co2 per person annually  citation needed  34  in other words  each person in the u s  would require a tower like the one featured by the discovery channel to remove this amount of co2 from the air  requiring an annual 2 megawatt-hours of electricity to operate it  by comparison  a refrigerator consumes about 1.2 megawatt-hours annually (2001 figures   35  but  by combining many small systems such as this into one large system  the construction costs and energy use can be reduced   it has been proposed that the solar updraft tower to generate electricity from thermal air currents also be used at the same time for amine gravity scrubbing of co2.[36  some heat would be required to regenerate the amine   a similar co2 scrubber has also been built by carbon engineering  besides simply focusing on capturing the co2  the company also puts emphasis on reuse of the co2  for example in the production of fuels  which would thus be carbon-neutral  37][38   direct air capture has been proposed as a way of generating carbon-neutral organic chemicals  by harvesting the atmospheric compounds and then using them in the production and synthesis of polymers and fuels   finally the swiss based climeworks is currently building the first industrial scale direct air capturing plant in hinwil  switzerland  starting in mai 2017  the plant is going to scrub about 900 metric tons of co2 per year using heat from a local waste incineration plant  the co2 should be sold to a local vegetable growing company  39   ocean fertilization or ocean nourishment is a type of climate engineering based on the purposeful introduction of nutrients to the upper ocean to increase marine food production and to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere  a number of techniques  including fertilization by iron  urea and phosphorus have been proposed   calcium oxide  quicklime  will absorb co2 from atmospheric air mixed with steam at 400\xa0\xb0c  forming calcium carbonate  and release it at 1,000\xa0\xb0c  this process  proposed by a  steinfeld  can be performed using renewable energy from thermal concentrated solar power  40  quicklime is made by heating limestone to release the co2 within it  quicklime is mixed with sand for brick building as mortar  where it hardens by absorption of co2   zeman and lackner outlined a specific method of air capture using sodium hydroxide  41  carbon engineering  a calgary  alberta firm founded in 2009 and partially funded by bill gates  is developing a process to capture carbon dioxide using a solution of potassium hydroxide mixed with some water at their pilot plant   they hope to create and sell synthetic fuels at a cost of $100 a ton  42   a crucial issue for cdr methods is their cost  which differs substantially among the different technologies  some of these are not sufficiently developed to perform cost assessments  the american physical society estimates the costs for direct air capture to be $600 tonne with optimistic assumptions  43  the iea greenhouse gas r amp d programme and ecofys provides an estimate that 3.5 billion tonnes could be removed annually from the atmosphere with beccs  bio-energy with carbon capture and storage  at carbon prices as low as \u20ac50 per tonne  44  while a report from biorecro and the global carbon capture and storage institute estimates costs  below \u20ac100  per tonne for large scale beccs deployment  4   cdr is slow to act  and requires a long-term political and engineering program to effect  45  cdr is even slower to take effect on acidified oceans  in a business as usual concentration pathway  the deep ocean will remain acidified for centuries  and as a consequence many marine species are in danger of extinction  46
