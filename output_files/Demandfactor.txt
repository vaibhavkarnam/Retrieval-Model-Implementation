Demandfactor
 in telecommunication  electronics and the electrical power industry  the term demand factor is used to refer to the fractional amount of some quantity being used relative to the maximum amount that could be used by the same system  the demand factor is always less than or equal to one  as the amount of demand is a time dependent quantity so is the demand factor    n n n n nf n nd ne nm na nn nd n n n  n n n nt n n  n  n n ndemand nmaximum possible demand n n n n n n n   displaystyle f  demand     it   t      frac    text demand     text maximum possible demand       n n  the demand factor is often implicitly averaged over time when the time period of demand is understood by the context   in electrical engineering the demand factor is taken as a time independent quantity where the numerator is taken as the maximum demand in the specified time period instead of the averaged or instantaneous demand  the possible   n n n n nf n nd ne nm na nn nd n n n  n n nmaximum load in given time period nmaximum possible load n n n n n   displaystyle f  demand     frac    text maximum load in given time period     text maximum possible load     n n  this is the peak in the load profile divided by the full load of the device   example  if a residence has equipment which would draw 6,000 w when all equipment was drawing a full load draw a maximum of 3,000 w in a specified time  then the demand factor   3,000 w   6,000 w   0.5   nthis quantity is relevant when trying to establish the amount of load a system should be rated for  in the above example it would be unlikely that the system would be rated to 6,000 w even though there may be a slight possibility that this amount of power can be drawn  this is closely related to the load factor which is the average load divided by the peak load in a specified time period    n n n n nf n nl no na nd n n n  n n naverage load nmaximum load in given time period n n n n n   displaystyle f  load     frac    text average load     text maximum load in given time period     n n
