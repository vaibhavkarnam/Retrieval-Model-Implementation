buffer state between imperial china and colonial india  13][14][15  in the 20th century  nepal ended its isolation and forged strong ties with regional powers  parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951  but was twice suspended by nepalese monarchs in 1960 and 2005  the nepalese civil war resulted in the proclamation of a republic in 2008  ending the reign of the world s last hindu monarchy  16   modern nepal is a federal secular parliamentary republic  it has seven states  nepal is a developing nation  ranking 145th on the human development index  hdi  in 2014  the country struggles with

particularly during the world wars  and has been a significant contributor to united nations peacekeeping operations       local legends have that a hindu sage named  ne  established himself in the valley of kathmandu in prehistoric times and that the word  nepal  came into existence as the place was protected   pala  in pali  by the sage  nemi   it is mentioned in vedic texts that this region was called nepal centuries ago  according to the skanda purana  a rishi called  nemi  used to live in the himalayas  21  in the pashupati purana  he is mentioned as a saint and a protector  22  he is said to have practised meditation at the bagmati and kesavati rivers 23  and to have taught there  24   the name of the country is also identical in origin to the name of the newar people  the terms "nep u0101l   "new u0101r   "new u0101l  and "nep u0101r  are phonetically different forms of the same word  and instances of the various forms appear in texts in different times in history  nepal is the learned sanskrit form and newar is the colloquial prakrit form  25  a sanskrit inscription dated 512 ce found in tistung  a valley to the west of kathmandu  contains the phrase  greetings to the nepals  indicating that the term  nepal  was used to refer to both the country and the people  26][27   it has been suggested that  nepal  may be a sanskritization of  newar   or  newar  may be a later form of "nepal   28  according to another explanation  the words  newar  and  newari  are vulgarisms arising from the mutation of p to v  and l to r  29   neolithic tools found in the kathmandu valley indicate that people have been living in the himalayan region for at least eleven thousand years  30  the oldest population layer is believed to be represented by the kusunda people  31   nepal is first mentioned in the late vedic atharvaveda pari u015bi u1e63\u1e6da as a place exporting blankets and in the post-vedic atharvashirsha upanishad  32  in samudragupta s allahabad pillar it is mentioned as a bordering country  the skanda purana has a separate chapter known as  nepal mahatmya  that explains in more details about the beauty and power of nepal  33  nepal is also mentioned in hindu texts such as the narayana puja  32   tibeto-burman-speaking people probably lived in nepal 2500 years ago  34  however  there is no archaeologic evidence of the gopal bansa or kirati rulers  only mention by the later licchavi and malla eras  35  the first inhabitants of nepal were properly of dravidian origin whose history predates the onset of the bronze age in south asia  around 3300 bce   before the coming of other ethnic groups like the tibeto-burmans and indo-aryans from across the border  30   around 500 bce  small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of nepal  from one of these  the shakya polity  arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life  founded buddhism  and came to be known as gautama buddha  traditionally dated 563\u2013483 bce    by 250 bce  the southern regions came under the influence of the maurya empire of north india and parts of nepal later on became a nominal vassal state under the gupta empire in the fourth century ce  beginning in the third century ce  the licchavi kingdom governed the kathmandu valley and the region surrounding central nepal   there is a quite detailed description of the kingdom of nepal in the account of the renowned chinese buddhist pilgrim monk xuanzang  dating from c  645 ce  36][37  stone inscriptions in the kathmandu valley are important sources for the history of nepal   the licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late eighth century  probably due to the tibetan empire  and was followed by a newar or thakuri era  from 879 ce  nepal sambat 1   although the extent of their control over the present-day country is uncertain  38  in the eleventh century it seems to have included the pokhara area  by the late eleventh century  southern nepal came under the influence of the chalukya dynasty of south india  under the chalukyas  nepal s religious establishment changed as the kings patronised hinduism instead of the buddhism prevailing at that time   in the early 12th century  leaders emerged in far western nepal whose names ended with the sanskrit suffix malla   wrestler    these kings consolidated their power and ruled over the next 200 years  until the kingdom splintered into two dozen petty states  another malla dynasty beginning with jayasthiti emerged in the kathmandu valley in the late 14th century  and much of central nepal again came under a unified rule  in 1482 the realm was divided into three kingdoms  kathmandu  patan  and bhaktapur   in the mid-18th century  prithvi narayan shah  a gorkha king  set out to put together what would become present-day nepal  he embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms  after several bloody battles and sieges  notably the battle of kirtipur  he managed to conquer the kathmandu valley in 1769  a detailed account of prithvi narayan shah s victory was written by father giuseppe  an eyewitness to the war  39   the gorkha dominion reached its height when the north indian territories of the kumaon and garhwal kingdoms in the west to sikkim in the east came under nepal rule  at its maximum extent  greater nepal extended from the teesta river in the east  to kangra  himachal pradesh  across the sutlej in the west as well as further south into the terai plains and north of the himalayas than at present  a dispute with tibet over the control of mountain passes and inner tingri valleys of tibet forced the qing emperor of china to start the sino-nepali war compelling the nepali to retreat and pay heavy reparations to peking   rivalry between kingdom of nepal and the east india company over the annexation of minor states bordering nepal eventually led to the anglo-nepali war (1815\u201316   at first the british underestimated the nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing  they were greatly impressed by the valour and competence of their adversaries  thus began the reputation of gurkhas as fierce and ruthless soldiers  the war ended in the sugauli treaty  under which nepal ceded recently captured portions of sikkim and lands in terai as well as the right to recruit soldiers  madhesis  having supported the east india company during the war  had their lands gifted to nepali  40   factionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability  in 1846 a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow jung bahadur kunwar  a fast-rising military leader  this led to the kot massacre  armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country  jung bahadur kunwar emerged victorious and founded the rana dynasty  later known as jung bahadur rana  the king was made a titular figure  and the post of prime minister was made powerful and hereditary  the ranas were staunchly pro-british and assisted them during the indian rebellion of 1857  and later in both world wars   some parts of the terai region populated with non-nepali peoples were gifted to nepal by the british as a friendly gesture because of her military help to sustain british control in india during the rebellion  in 1923  the united kingdom and nepal formally signed an agreement of friendship that superseded the sugauli treaty of 1816.[40   slavery was abolished in nepal in 1924.[41  nevertheless  debt bondage even involving debtors  children has been a persistent social problem in the terai  rana rule was marked by tyranny  debauchery  economic exploitation and religious persecution  42][43   in the late 1940s  newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in nepal were critical of the rana autocracy  meanwhile  with the invasion of tibet by china in the 1950s  india sought to counterbalance the perceived military threat from its northern neighbour by taking pre-emptive steps to assert more influence in nepal  india sponsored both king tribhuvan  ruled 1911\u201355  as nepal s new ruler in 1951 and a new government  mostly comprising the nepali congress  thus terminating rana hegemony in the kingdom  40   after years of power wrangling between the king and the government  king mahendra  ruled 1955\u201372  scrapped the democratic experiment in 1959  and a  partyless  panchayat system was made to govern nepal until 1989  when the  jan andolan   people s movement  forced king birendra  ruled 1972\u20132001  to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament that took seat in may 1991.[44  in 1991\u201392  bhutan expelled roughly 100,000 bhutanese citizens of nepali descent  most of whom have been living in seven refugee camps in eastern nepal ever since  45   in 1996  the communist party of nepal started a bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a people s republic by violent means  this led to the long nepali civil war and more than 12,000 deaths   on 1 june 2001  there was a massacre in the royal palace  king birendra  queen aishwarya and seven other members of the royal family were killed  the perpetrator was crown prince dipendra  who committed suicide  he died three days later  shortly thereafter  this outburst was alleged to have been dipendra s response to his parents  refusal to accept his choice of wife  nevertheless  there is speculation and doubts among nepali citizens about who was responsible   following the carnage  king birendra s brother gyanendra inherited the throne  on 1 february 2005  king gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers to quash the violent maoist movement  44  but this initiative was unsuccessful because a stalemate had developed in which the maoists were firmly entrenched in large expanses of countryside but could not yet dislodge the military from numerous towns and the largest cities  in september 2005  the maoists declared a three-month unilateral ceasefire to negotiate   in response to the 2006 democracy movement  king gyanendra agreed to relinquish sovereign power to the people  on 24 april 2006 the dissolved house of representatives was reinstated  using its newly acquired sovereign authority  on 18 may 2006 the house of representatives unanimously voted to curtail the power of the king and declared nepal a secular state  ending its time-honoured official status as a hindu kingdom  on 28 december 2007  a bill was passed in parliament to amend article 159 of the constitution xa0\u2013 replacing  provisions regarding the king  by  provisions of the head of the state  xa0\u2013 declaring nepal a federal republic  and thereby abolishing the monarchy  46  the bill came into force on 28 may 2008.[47   the unified communist party of nepal  maoist  won the largest number of seats in the constituent assembly election held on 10 april 2008  and formed a coalition government which included most of the parties in the ca  although acts of violence occurred during the pre-electoral period  election observers noted that the elections themselves were markedly peaceful and  well-carried out   48   the newly elected assembly met in kathmandu on 28 may 2008  and  after a polling of 564 constituent assembly members  560 voted to form a new government  47  with the monarchist rastriya prajatantra party  which had four members in the assembly  registering a dissenting note  at that point  it was declared that nepal had become a secular and inclusive democratic republic  49][50  with the government announcing a three-day public holiday from 28\u201330 may  the king was thereafter given 15 days to vacate narayanhity palace so it could reopen as a public museum  51   nonetheless  political tensions and consequent power-sharing battles have continued in nepal  in may 2009  the maoist-led government was toppled and another coalition government with all major political parties barring the maoists was formed  52  madhav kumar nepal of the communist party of nepal  unified marxist u2013leninist  was made the prime minister of the coalition government  53  in february 2011 the madhav kumar nepal government was toppled and jhala nath khanal of the communist party of nepal  unified marxist u2013leninist  was made the prime minister  54  in august 2011 the jhala nath khanal government was toppled and baburam bhattarai of the communist party of nepal  maoist  was made the prime minister  55   the political parties were unable to draft a constitution in the stipulated time  56  this led to dissolution of the constituent assembly to pave way for new elections to strive for a new political mandate  in opposition to the theory of separation of powers  then chief justice khil raj regmi was made the chairman of the caretaker government  under regmi  the nation saw peaceful elections for the constituent assembly  the major forces in the earlier constituent assembly  namely cpn maoists and madhesi parties  dropped to distant 3rd and even below  57][58   in february 2014  after consensus was reached between the two major parties in the constituent assembly  sushil koirala was sworn in as the new prime minister of nepal  59][60   in 20 september 2015  a new constitution  the  constitution of nepal 2015   nepali  \u0928\u0947\u092a u093e u0932\u0915\u094b \u0938\u0902\u0935\u093f u0927\u093e u0928 \u0968\u0966\u096d u0968  was announced by president ram baran yadav in the constituent assembly  the constituent assembly was transformed into a legislative parliament by the then-chairman of that assembly  the new constitution of nepal has changed nepal practically into a federal democratic republic by making 7 unnamed states   on 25 april 2015  a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck nepal  61  two

areas  mountain  hill and terai  these ecological belts run east u2013west and are vertically intersected by nepal s major  north to south flowing river systems   the southern lowland plains or terai

until 1990  nepal was a monarchy under executive control of the king  faced with a communist movement against absolute monarchy  king birendra  in 1990  agreed to a large-scale political reform by creating a parliamentary monarchy with the king as the head of state and a prime minister as the head of the government   nepal s legislature was bicameral  consisting of a house of representatives called the pratinidhi sabha and a national council called the rastriya sabha  the house of representatives consisted of 205 members directly elected by the people  the national council had 60 members  ten nominated by the king  35 elected by the house of representatives  and the remaining 15 elected by an electoral college made up of chairs of villages and towns  the legislature had a five-year term but was dissolvable by the king before its term could end  all nepali citizens 18 years and older became eligible to vote   the executive comprised the king and the council of ministers  the cabinet   the leader of the coalition or party securing the maximum seats in an election was appointed as the prime minister  the cabinet was appointed by the king on the recommendation of the prime minister  governments in nepal tended to be highly unstable  falling either through internal collapse or parliamentary dissolution by the monarch  on the recommendation of the prime minister  according to the constitution  no government has survived for more than two years since 1991   the movement in april 2006 brought about a change in the nation s governance  an interim constitution was promulgated  with the king giving up power  and an interim house of representatives was formed with maoist members after the new government held peace talks with the maoist rebels  the number of parliamentary seats was also increased to 330  in april 2007  the communist party of nepal  maoist  joined the interim government of nepal   in december 2007  the interim parliament passed a bill

percent of the population in 2011 from 64.7 percent in 2006\u20144.1 percentage points per year  which means that nepal has made improvement in sectors like nutrition  child mortality  electricity

96][97   the spectacular landscape and diverse  exotic cultures of nepal represent considerable potential for tourism  but growth in the industry has been stifled by political instability and poor

aviation is in a better state  with 47 airports  11 of them with paved runways  113  flights are frequent and support a sizable traffic  the hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of

twin goals of forest conservation and poverty reduction  as more than 70 percent of nepal s population depends on agriculture for their livelihood  community management of forests has been a critically important intervention  through legislative developments and operational innovations over three decades  the program has evolved from a protection-oriented  conservation-focused agenda to a much more broad-based strategy for forest use  enterprise development  and livelihood improvement  by april 2009  one-third of nepal s population was participating in the program  directly managing more than one-fourth of nepal s forest area  137][138   the immediate livelihood benefits derived by rural households bolster strong collective action wherein local communities actively and sustainably manage forest resources  community forests also became the source of diversified investment capital and raw material for new market-oriented livelihoods  community forestry shows traits of political  financial  and ecological sustainability  including an emergence of a strong legal and regulatory framework  and robust civil society institutions and networks  however  a continuing challenge is to ensure equitable distribution of benefits to women and marginalized groups  lessons for replication emphasize experiential learning  establishment of a strong civil society network  flexible regulation to encourage diverse institutional modalities  and responsiveness of government and policymakers to a multistakeholder collaborative learning process  139][140   historical

the general public  but only to a handful of members of the rana regime  throughout the rana regime that lasted for well over a century  nepal was effectively isolated from the rest of the world  owing to this isolation  nepal was relatively untouched by and unfamiliar of social transformations brought about by the british invasion in india and the industrial revolution in the west  142  however  after the advent of democracy and abolition of rana regime in 1951  nepal broke free from the shackles of self-imposed isolation and opened up to the outside world  this opening marked the initiation of s amp t activities in the country  143   an underdeveloped country  nepal is plagued with problems such as poverty  illiteracy  unemployment  and the like  consequently  science and technology have invariably lagged behind in the priority list of the government  on the other hand  citing poor university education at home  tens of thousands of nepali students leave the country every year  with half of them never returning  144][145  these factors have been huge deterrents to the development of science and technology in nepal   law enforcement in nepal is primarily the responsibility of the nepali police force which is the national police of nepal  146  it is independent of the nepali army  in the days of its establishment  nepal police personnel were mainly drawn
