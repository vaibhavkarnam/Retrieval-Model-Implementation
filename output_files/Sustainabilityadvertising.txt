the sustainability communication concept  2   sustainability advertising is used to advert customers to sustainable products  services and actions  it is not only focused on environmental issues and the product or service itself  but includes communication about the entire life cycle of the product  it furthermore informs about the sustainability of the producing company and communicates desirable lifestyles changes to consumers  3  advertising in general is a one-way communication through mass media 4  and is used to create name recognition  brand knowledge and some brand preference  5  however  only sustainability advertising contributes to all three pillars of triple bottom line  economic development  environmental protection and social responsibility  6   whenever an advertisement campaign is developed and launched as a marketing strategy for a sustainable product or service  it must be aligned to the objectives defined by the company in the context of sustainability  some of the common objectives of marketing communications are  generation of awareness  informing consumers  reminding consumers  persuading consumers  reassuring consumers  motivating and rewarding consumers and connecting with them  4  these are the basis for more specific objectives of sustainability advertising with the emphasis on environmental and social aspects  the united nations environmental program  unep  has developed documents that give insights about the objectives of the sustainability advertising  they include  7   1  \u201censuring truth in advertising \u2013 the advertising codes provided and supported by the advertising industry and other mechanisms to ensure that claims can be substantiated  to prevent consumers from being misled u201d  this is related to the objectives of informing consumers and reassuring them whenever there is misleading critics or arguments against a particular product  service or implemented action   2  \u201censuring ethical behavior from advertisers  so that messages are legal  decent  honest and truthful u201d  advertisement should not include attempts of greenwashing and reference to false social responsibility claims   3  \u201censuring that all sectors of society  including women  minorities  the elderly and children are sensitively portrayed  u201d this \u201cis associated with the challenge of sustainability advertising to address and \u201cconnect u201d with different audiences through a mass media message u201d   4  \u201chow advertising agencies  and the advertisers themselves  operate  as with all other sectors  organizations in the advertising industry need to address their direct effects on the environment and society  and the need for environmental management systems  reporting and corporate social responsibility programs  u201d this area refers to the coherence needed whenever a sustainability message in advertising is set  the advertising message and the behavior of the company should be consistent to create trust and credibility   the conventional marketing mix concept was gradually developed during the economic miracle right after world war ii and included the 4p u2019s model  introduced around 1960.[8  this model  in which the promotion of products with advertising as one of its main tools plays an important role  was helpful for many industries in many markets  u201d 9  however  the market situation changed  con-sumers became more aware of the social and ecological implications of their purchases and at the same time inherent attributes like efficiency and cost effectiveness  health and safety  symbolism and status needed to be highlighted by companies in order to remain competitive in the market  10  the companies have been adapting to the changes and now move towards \u201crelationship marketing focused more on communicating with the consumer u201d 11  rather than just promoting the product  they use advertising  along with other activities and resources  12  as a tool to inform the consumers and stakeholders about the sustainability solutions the company provides and about the company as a whole  13   \u201cthe relationship between marketing and the environment has been examined since the early 1970s u201d  14  first  the idea of ecological marketing was developed and mainly centered in the \u201cdepletion of energy and non-energy natural resources and the pollution created as by-product of production and consumption  u201d 15  \u201cthe first tentative steps of non-polluting industry and first uses of nature in advertising arose u201d 16  and were later accompanied by an intensive mediatization of environmental issues in the 1980s  for example  the discovery of the \xb4hole in the ozone layer  in 1985 and chernobyl in 1986.[16  by this time  green marketing and environmental marketing concepts were built up and elements from the product life cycle assessment  associated with environmental marketing  as well as destruction of ecosystems and poverty in developing countries  associated with green marketing  15  were considered in the advertising campaigns   lately  the concept of sustainability advertising has evolved as it is defined in the first part of this article  it has encountered critics  and limitations  but also challenges that are guiding the companies  governments and organizations to the implementation of more holistic and sustainable practices in the process of providing products and services worldwide   information carriers of marketing messages are mainly mainstream media like national television  national radio and print  those media are also engaged in sustainability promotion  because they are central players in building consumers culture  17  within radio  print or television campaigns sustainability advertisements are pointing out the social  environmental and economical benefits of sustainable products and services  18  strategic advertising messages are then connected with corporate communication leading towards the development of a responsible and civic image of the company  however  mainstream media have constrains in promoting sustainability issues due to limitations to the application of persuasive  motivational or educative communication  19  most sustainability advertising campaigns therefore combine different types of mainstream media to approach the consumer on different levels of information reception   sustainability advertising on the radio refers only to audio  high imagery ads that elicit visual images in the minds of listeners show positive effects on attitude toward the brand and purchase intention  20  the right choice of words for the campaign and the possibility to activate imagination of the consumer and raise the desire for the product or service is the challenge for radio advertising   print media are paper based media methods like magazines  newspaper  books  flyers or posters  therefore  print advertising generally includes a higher resource use in terms of paper  compared to digital radio and television campaigns  the choice of the right print media is important to inform the defined target group about the sustainable products and services  advertisements in daily newspapers whose readers are ed-ucated and interested in sustainability issues  as well as in magazines promoting a sustainable lifestyle contribute to raise consumers u2019 interest in sustainable products and services  posters on the other hand are often used for social marketing campaigns  21   television is the dominant type of media in the developed countries 22  and combines audio and visual possibilities of sustainability advertising  its effectiveness results from \u2018learning without involvement u2019 which means that the consumer takes up the information even without being interested at first  23  consequentially  television is an essential media for sustainability advertising   the target group for sustainability advertising is \u201cresponsible consumers u201d  they are aware of sustainable development issues or in the niche of activists and follow sustainability principles  these consumers have a continuously developing commitment towards a more responsible lifestyle and are serious in their sustainable intentions and behavior  they are interested in information about products or services  real product labeling and have an independent attitude towards mass media and advertising  responsible consumers can be seen as  optimistic realists  encouraging society to continue development in a sustainable way  they are critical towards their own behavior concerning environmental impact of the products or services they consume  responsible consumers are sensitive for corporate behavior and are careful in trusting companies which laud their social or environmental commitment even if it is independently monitored  24  they consume efficiently  see economic growth decoupled from environmental degradation and focus on \u2018common but differentiated responsibility u2019 to improve the quality of life  25  responsible consumers demand a higher value from their purchases in terms of social responsibility  environmental impacderations  26  they show an increasing awareness on social and environmental issues and offers in domestic and export markets  26  focusing on the responsible consumer as an overall target group  further division into the following target subgroups can be made  27   \u2022 lohas \u2013 who are strongly concerned about their health  taste of food and with a high level of responsibility for environmental and social issues   \u2022 status addicts \u2013 who are strongly concerned about social visibility of the purchase and want to be perceived as sustainability consumers   \u2022 transition towns community members \u2013 narrow group with the focus on local consumption and sustainability   \u2022 concerned parents \u2013 who want the best and the healthiest products for their children   \u2022 currently constrained \u2013 who would like to be more sustainable  but don u2019t think there is much they can do in their current circumstances   range of coverage  speed and scale with which the message is spread refers to one of the most significant advantages of the sustainability advertising  advertising is capable of reaching a large or dispersed market repeatedly with persuasive and informative messages 4  and is considered to be one of the most powerful sources of symbolic meaning in modern society  28  sustainability advertising campaigns motivate pro-environmental attitudes  29  being one of the tools of sustainability communication strategy  advertising campaigns focus on the intrinsic motivations of the consumers  their attitudes and beliefs as one of the determinants of the sustainability friendly consumption behavior   sustainability advertising represents the primary communication tool to which major part of con-sumer group is exposed on the market  it serves as a source of initial information for the consumers  concerning the social and environmental status of product and company  on the basis of the primary impression the consumer than takes the decision whether the product and the company behind deserve further evaluation as a potential purchase choice  therefore  sustainability advertising \u201chelps to inform consumers and facilitates consumer choice u201d  30   as marketing communication tool sustainability advertising can be used as an instrument to modify the impact of human activities on the planet  there are three factors  which contribute to the total human impact  population  affluence and technology  4  sustainability advertising addresses affluence by promoting reduction of the environmental and social footprint of the society on the planet  originally advertising was one of the factors that created consumption culture  thus playing an important role in shaping consumer preferences and the social and environmental impact they produce  sustainability advertising however  is responsible for the lifestyle changes in the society  from materialistic towards more sustainable  31   a variety of marketing communication tools offer producers a wide range of opportunities to build relationships with a consumer  due to the format restrictions sustainability advertising often is not able provide comprehensive information about the product  32  nevertheless  it serves as a link to more substantial sources of information  e g  a company u2019s web page  where consumer can find more data on environmental and social aspects of the product  this link enables further development of the communication process between the company and the consumer  so  under favorable conditions and linked to a competent communication strategy it can be transformed into long lasting mutually beneficial relationships between the two   promoting sustainable solutions through sustainability advertising provides corporations with big competitive advantages 33  and allows them to educate and inform consumers as well as stimulate their emotions towards the product  nevertheless  there are some limitations   general advertising as well as sustainability advertising operate by sending out unidirectional messages to its entire audience at one  4  at the same time the ability to connect with the single consumers as well as the chances for them to respond are strongly limited  that means the creation of feedback-relationships between corporations and its customers through sustainable advertisement is limited too  to avoid the typical one-way communication and to provide consumers and corporations with the chance to give and receive feedback  advertising can be used in combination with other key media such as online communication or labeling  interactive advertising then enables the company to build op strong customer-relationships despite the primer lack of personalized messages  34   a special challenge for sustainability advertising is the complexity of the messages that have to be communicated  to avoid what is called \xb4sustainability advertising myopia  \u2013 an exclusive focus on the \u201cgreen u201d aspects of the product \u2013 the advertising message should not only include the social and environmental attributes of a product  but also connect them to the inherent consumer benefits  35  as well as men-tion the main buying criteria influencing the consumers xb4 buying decision  36][37  however  communicating meaningful about the complex interplay of social  environmental  economic  technical and consumer benefits of a product from a sustainability perspective using a 30-second radio or television slot or a single printed page can be a serious challenge  32  to make information uptake easier for consumers a selection of the core information and its transformation into simple advertising messages in combination with other key media  like annual environ-mental reports or links to web pages that provide more detailed information about the product  37  can be helpful   a challenge related to the complexity of messages is the risk of information overload  it results from the corporations u2019 effort to gain more credibility and trust by providing search qualities in form of text and fact oriented advertising  however  facing the information overload of today u2019s consumers mainly socio-ecologically conscious consumers perceive the fact focused advertising  38  enhancing the emotional appeal of sustainability advertising can create emotional connections with a larger range of consumers and stimulate their involvement with the product  39  one of the most common approaches is the so-called  \u201eecotainment u201c 40  \u2013 the creation of consumers xb4 involvement by including a celebrity into the advertisement  41   a strong threat to the credibility of sustainability advertising can be seen in corporate \u201cgreenwashing u201d  a form of disinformation from organizations seeking to repair public reputations and further shape public images  42  it allows firms to manipulate an image of environmental  social  and cultural responsiveness 43  by communicating false or misleading sustainability claims  this common practice damages the overall credibility of corporate sustainability claims and leads to mistrust of the consumers  this general inconsistency between a company u2019s messages and it actions could finally explain the value action gap between consumers strongly expressed concerns about socio-ecological issues and their nevertheless relatively low purchase of sustainable goods and services  44   therefore  the most important future challenge concerning firms as well as advertising agencies is certainly a better understanding of the benefits of corporate socio-ecological responsibility in communications  45  especially advertising agencies often lack the technical expertise to ensure that the communications of new sustainable messages are credible and fail to ensure that there is alignment between a client s corporate practices and external communications  46  this often leads to passed up marketing opportunities and hinders the creation of positive brand value  to overcome those barriers advertising agencies must gain expertise and experience in the fields of sustainable advertising  so the promotion of sustainability issues becomes part of a real corporate philosophy advertised through all communication channels  47
