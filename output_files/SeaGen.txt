SeaGen
 seagen is the world s first large scale commercial tidal stream generator  1][2][3  it was four times more powerful than any other tidal stream generator in the world at the time of installation  4   the first seagen generator was installed in strangford narrows between strangford and portaferry in northern ireland  uk in april 2008 and was connected to the grid in july 2008.[5  it generates 1.2\xa0mw for between 18 and 20\xa0hours a day while the tides are forced in and out of strangford lough through the narrows  6  strangford lough was also the site of the very first known tide mill in the world  the nendrum monastery mill where remains dating from 787 have been excavated       marine current turbines  the developer of seagen  demonstrated first prototype of tidal stream generator in 1994 with a 15\xa0kilowatt system in loch linnhe  off the west coast of scotland  in may 2003  the prototype for seagen   seaflow   was installed off the coast of lynmouth  north devon  england  6  seaflow was a single rotor turbine which generated 300\xa0kw but was not connected to the grid  seaflow was the world s first offshore tidal generator  and remained the world s largest until seagen was installed  7   seagen generator weighs 300\xa0tonnes  3][8  each driving a generator through a gearbox like a hydro-electric or wind turbine  these turbines have a patented feature by which the rotor blades can be pitched through 180\xa0degrees allowing them to operate in both flow directions \u2013 on ebb and flood tides  the company claims a capacity factor of 0.59  average of the last 2000 hours   the power units of each system are mounted on arm-like extensions either side of a tubular steel monopile some 3 metres (9.8\xa0ft  in diameter and the arms with the power units can be raised above the surface for safe and easy maintenance access  1  the seagen was built at belfast s harland and wolff s shipyards  9   seagen has been licensed to operate over a period of 5\xa0years  during which there will be a comprehensive environmental monitoring programme to determine the precise impact on the marine environment  10   during the commissioning of the system a software error caused the blades of one of the turbines to be damaged  this left the turbine operating at half power until autumn 2008  the incident is being investigated and mct is confident that it will not happen again  11  full power operation was finally achieved on 18 dec 2008.[12
