Financialcrisisof2007E2809308
 the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008  also known as the global financial crisis and the 2008 financial crisis  is considered by many economists to have been the worst financial crisis since the great depression of the 1930s  1][2][3][4   it began in 2007 with a crisis in the subprime mortgage market in the usa  and developed into a full-blown international banking crisis with the collapse of the investment bank lehman brothers on september 15  2008.[5  excessive risk taking by banks such as lehman brothers helped to magnify the financial impact globally  6  massive bail-outs of financial institutions and other palliative monetary and fiscal policies were employed to prevent a possible collapse of the world s financial system  the crisis was nonetheless followed by a global economic downturn  the great recession  the european debt crisis  a crisis in the banking system of the european countries using the euro  followed later   the dodd u2013frank act  7  was enacted in the us in the aftermath of the crisis to  promote the financial stability of the united states  8   although it has been criticized as the  biggest expansion of government power over banking and markets since the depression  9  creating new market distortions that might create new crises in the future  10  and that it  has crushed small banks  restricted access to credit  and planted the seeds of financial instability  11     the basel iii capital and liquidity standards were adopted by countries around the world  12       the precipitating factor was a high default rate in the united states subprime home mortgage sector  the expansion of this sector was encouraged by the community reinvestment act (cra   13][14][15][16  a us federal law designed to help low- and moderate-income americans get mortgage loans  17  many of these subprime  high risk  loans were then bundled and sold  finally accruing to quasi-government agencies  fannie mae and freddie mac   18  the implicit guarantee by the us federal government created a moral hazard and contributed to a glut of risky lending  many of these loans were also bundled together and formed into new financial instruments called mortgage-backed securities  which could be sold as  ostensibly  low-risk securities partly because they were often backed by credit default swaps insurance  19  because mortgage lenders could pass these mortgages  and the associated risks  on in this way  they could and did adopt loose underwriting criteria  encouraged by regulators   and some developed aggressive lending practices  the accumulation and subsequent high default rate of these mortgages led to the financial crisis  and the consequent damage to the world economy   high mortgage approval rates led to a large pool of home-buyers  which drove up housing prices  this appreciation in value led large numbers of homeowners  subprime or not  to borrow against their homes as an apparent windfall  this  bubble  would be burst by a rising single-family residential mortgages delinquency rate  beginning in august  2006 and peaking in the first quarter  2010).[20  the high delinquency rates led to a rapid devaluation of financial instruments  mortgage-backed securities including bundled loan portfolios  derivatives and credit default swaps   as the value of these assets plummeted  the market  buyers  for these securities evaporated and banks who were heavily invested in these assets began to experience a liquidity crisis  lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy on september 15  2008  merrill lynch  aig  freddie mac  fannie mae  hbos  royal bank of scotland  bradford  amp  bingley  fortis  hypo and alliance  amp  leicester were all expected to follow \u2013 with a us federal bailout announced the following day beginning with $85b to aig  in spite of trillions 21  paid out by the us federal government  it became much more difficult to borrow money  the resulting decrease in buyers caused housing prices to plummet   while the collapse of large financial institutions was prevented by the bailout of banks by national governments  stock markets still dropped worldwide  in many areas  the housing market also suffered  resulting in evictions  foreclosures  and prolonged unemployment  the crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses  declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of us dollars  and a downturn in economic activity leading to the great recession of 2008\u20132012 and contributing to the european sovereign-debt crisis  22][23  the active phase of the crisis  which manifested as a liquidity crisis  can be dated from august 9  2007  when bnp paribas terminated withdrawals from three hedge funds citing  a complete evaporation of liquidity   24   the bursting of the us housing bubble  which peaked at the end of 2006,[25][26  caused the values of securities tied to us real estate pricing to plummet  damaging financial institutions globally  27][28  the financial crisis was triggered by a complex interplay of policies that encouraged home ownership  providing easier access to loans for subprime borrowers  overvaluation of bundled subprime mortgages based on the theory that housing prices would continue to escalate  questionable trading practices on behalf of both buyers and sellers  compensation structures that prioritize short-term deal flow over long-term value creation  and a lack of adequate capital holdings from banks and insurance companies to back the financial commitments they were making  29][30][31][32  questions regarding bank solvency  declines in credit availability  and damaged investor confidence affected global stock markets  where securities suffered large losses during 2008 and early 2009  economies worldwide slowed during this period  as credit tightened and international trade declined  33  governments and central banks responded with unprecedented fiscal stimulus  monetary policy expansion and institutional bailouts  34  in the us  congress passed the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009   many causes for the financial crisis have been suggested  with varying weight assigned by experts  35   the immediate cause or trigger of the crisis was the bursting of the us housing bubble  which peaked in 2006/2007.[25][26  already-rising default rates on  subprime  and adjustable-rate mortgages  arm  began to increase quickly thereafter   easy availability of credit in the us  fueled by large inflows of foreign funds after the russian debt crisis and asian financial crisis of the 1997\u20131998 period  led to a housing construction boom and facilitated debt-financed consumer spending  as banks began to give out more loans to potential home owners  housing prices began to rise  lax lending standards and rising real estate prices also contributed to the real estate bubble  loans of various types  e g   mortgage  credit card  and auto  were easy to obtain and consumers assumed an unprecedented debt load  43][44][45   as part of the housing and credit booms  the number of financial agreements called mortgage-backed securities  mbs  and collateralized debt obligations  cdo   which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices  greatly increased  28  such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the us housing market  as housing prices declined  major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime mbs reported significant losses  46   falling prices also resulted in homes worth less than the mortgage loan  providing a financial incentive to enter foreclosure  clarification needed  the ongoing foreclosure epidemic that began in late 2006 in the us and only reduced to historical levels in early 2014[47  drained significant wealth from consumers  losing up to $4.2 trillion 48  in wealth from home equity  defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy  total losses are estimated in the trillions of us dollars globally  46   while the housing and credit bubbles were building  a series of factors caused the financial system to both expand and become increasingly fragile  a process called financialization  us government policy from the 1970s onward has emphasized deregulation to encourage business  which resulted in less oversight of activities and less disclosure of information about new activities undertaken by banks and other evolving financial institutions  thus  policymakers did not immediately recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and hedge funds  also known as the shadow banking system  some experts believe these institutions had become as important as commercial  depository  banks in providing credit to the us economy  but they were not subject to the same regulations  50   these institutions  as well as certain regulated banks  had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or mbs losses  51  these losses affected the ability of financial institutions to lend  slowing economic activity  concerns regarding the stability of key financial institutions drove central banks to provide funds to encourage lending and restore faith in the commercial paper markets  which are integral to funding business operations  governments also bailed out key financial institutions and implemented economic stimulus programs  assuming significant additional financial commitments   the us financial crisis inquiry commission reported its findings in january 2011  it concluded that   the crisis was avoidable and was caused by  widespread failures in financial regulation  including the federal reserve s failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages  dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk  an explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and wall street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis  key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis  lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw  and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels  52][53   the 2000s were the decade of subprime borrowers  no longer was this a segment left to fringe lenders  the relaxing of credit lending standards by investment banks and commercial banks drove this about-face  subprime did not become magically less risky  wall street just accepted this higher risk  54  during a period of tough competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share  and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited  mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers  28  in the view of some analysts  the relatively conservative government-sponsored enterprises  gses  policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003  however  as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined gse power  mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated  28  the worst loans were originated in 2004\u20132007  the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the gses   as well as easy credit conditions  there is evidence that competitive pressures contributed to an increase in the amount of subprime lending during the years preceding the crisis  major us investment banks and gses such as fannie mae played an important role in the expansion of lending  with gses eventually relaxing their standards to try to catch up with the private banks  55][56   a contrarian view is that fannie mae and freddie mac led the way to relaxed underwriting standards  starting in 1995  by advocating the use of easy-to-qualify automated underwriting and appraisal systems  by designing the no-downpayment products issued by lenders  by the promotion of thousands of small mortgage brokers  and by their close relationship to subprime loan aggregators such as countrywide  57][58   depending on how \u201csubprime u201d mortgages are defined  they remained below 10  of all mortgage originations until 2004  when they spiked to nearly 20  and remained there through the 2005\u20132006 peak of the united states housing bubble  59   the majority report of the financial crisis inquiry commission  written by the six democratic appointees  the minority report  written by three of the four republican appointees  studies by federal reserve economists  and the work of several independent scholars generally contend that government affordable housing policy was not the primary cause of the financial crisis  28  although they concede that governmental policies had some role in causing the crisis  they contend that gse loans performed better than loans securitized by private investment banks  and performed better than some loans originated by institutions that held loans in their own portfolios  28   in his dissent to the majority report of the financial crisis inquiry commission  american enterprise institute fellow peter j  wallison 60  stated his belief that the roots of the financial crisis can be traced directly and primarily to affordable housing policies initiated by the us department of housing and urban development  hud  in the 1990s and to massive risky loan purchases by government-sponsored entities fannie mae and freddie mac  later  based upon information in the sec s december 2011 securities fraud case against six former executives of fannie and freddie  peter wallison and edward pinto estimated that  in 2008  fannie and freddie held 13 million substandard loans totaling over $2 trillion  61   in the early and mid-2000s  the bush administration called numerous times 62  for investigation into the safety and soundness of the gses and their swelling portfolio of subprime mortgages  on september 10  2003  the house financial services committee held a hearing at the urging of the administration to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the office of federal housing enterprise oversight  ofheo  that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities  63  the hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of fannie mae and freddie mac  as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked ofheo for their attempt at regulation  64  some believe this was an early warning to the systemic risk that the growing market in subprime mortgages posed to the us financial system that went unheeded  65   a 2000 united states department of the treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that $467\xa0billion of mortgage lending was made by community reinvestment act  cra -covered lenders into low and mid level income  lmi  borrowers and neighborhoods  representing 10  of all us mortgage lending during the period  the majority of these were prime loans  sub-prime loans made by cra-covered institutions constituted a 3  market share of lmi loans in 1998,[66  but in the run-up to the crisis  fully 25  of all sub-prime lending occurred at cra-covered institutions and another 25  of sub-prime loans had some connection with cra  67  furthermore  most sub-prime loans were not made to the lmi borrowers targeted by the cra  especially in the years 2005\u20132006 leading up to the crisis  nor did it find any evidence that lending under the cra rules increased delinquency rates or that the cra indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending   to other analysts the delay between cra rule changes  in 1995  and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising  and does not exonerate the cra  they contend that there were two  connected causes to the crisis  the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the federal reserve after the terrorist attack on september 11  2001  both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place  68  critics also point out that publicly announced cra loan commitments were massive  totaling $4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007.[69  they also argue that the federal reserve s classification of cra loans as  prime  is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans (3 percentage points over average  equal  subprime  loans  70   others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude  in an article in portfolio magazine  michael lewis spoke with one trader who noted that  there weren t enough americans with  bad  credit taking out  bad loans  to satisfy investors  appetite for the end product   essentially  investment banks and hedge funds used financial innovation to enable large wagers to be made  far beyond the actual value of the underlying mortgage loans  using derivatives called credit default swaps  collateralized debt obligations and synthetic cdos  71   as of march 2011  the fdic had had to pay out $9 billion to cover losses on bad loans at 165 failed financial institutions  72  the congressional budget office estimated  in june 2011  that the bailout to fannie mae and freddie mac exceeds $300 billion  calculated by adding the fair value deficits of the entities to the direct bailout funds at the time   73   economist paul krugman argued in january 2010 that the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles and the global nature of the crisis undermines the case made by those who argue that fannie mae  freddie mac  cra  or predatory lending were primary causes of the crisis  in other words  bubbles in both markets developed even though only the residential market was affected by these potential causes  74   countering krugman  peter j  wallison wrote   it is not true that every bubble u2014even a large bubble u2014has the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates   wallison notes that other developed countries had  large bubbles during the 1997\u20132007 period  but  the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the united states when the 1997\u20132007  bubble  deflated   according to wallison  the reason the us residential housing bubble  as opposed to other types of bubbles  led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loans u2014generally with low or no downpayments  75   krugman s contention  that the growth of a commercial real estate bubble indicates that us housing policy was not the cause of the crisis  is challenged by additional analysis  after researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis  xudong an and anthony b  sanders reported  in december 2010    we find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in cmbs  commercial mortgage-backed securities  loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis   76  other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place after the crisis in residential real estate  business journalist kimberly amadeo reports   the first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in 2006  three years later  commercial real estate started feeling the effects  77  denice a  gierach  a real estate attorney and cpa  wrote      most of the commercial real estate loans were good loans destroyed by a really bad economy  in other words  the borrowers did not cause the loans to go bad  it was the economy  78   between 1998 and 2006  the price of the typical american house increased by 124%.[79  during the two decades ending in 2001  the national median home price ranged from 2.9 to 3.1 times median household income  this ratio rose to 4.0 in 2004  and 4.6 in 2006.[80  this housing bubble resulted in many homeowners refinancing their homes at lower interest rates  or financing consumer spending by taking out second mortgages secured by the price appreciation   in a peabody award winning program  npr correspondents argued that a  giant pool of money   represented by $70\xa0trillion in worldwide fixed income investments  sought higher yields than those offered by us treasury bonds early in the decade  this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007  yet the supply of relatively safe  income generating investments had not grown as fast  investment banks on wall street answered this demand with products such as the mortgage-backed security and the collateralized debt obligation that were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies  81   in effect  wall street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the us  with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain  from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers and the large investment banks behind them  by approximately 2003  the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted  and continued strong demand began to drive down lending standards  81   the collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending  extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees  this essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority  those securities first in line received investment-grade ratings from rating agencies  securities with lower priority had lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested  82][83   by september 2008  average us housing prices had declined by over 20  from their mid-2006 peak  84][85  as prices declined  borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages could not refinance to avoid the higher payments associated with rising interest rates and began to default  during 2007  lenders began foreclosure proceedings on nearly 1.3\xa0million properties  a 79  increase over 2006.[86  this increased to 2.3\xa0million in 2008  an 81  increase vs  2007.[87  by august 2008  9.2  of all us mortgages outstanding were either delinquent or in foreclosure  88  by september 2009  this had risen to 14.4%.[89   lower interest rates encouraged borrowing  from 2000 to 2003  the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate target from 6.5  to 1.0%.[90  this was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the dot-com bubble and the september 2001 terrorist attacks  as well as to combat a perceived risk of deflation  91  as early as 2002 it was apparent that credit was fueling housing instead of business investment as some economists went so far as to advocate that the fed  needs to create a housing bubble to replace the nasdaq bubble   92  moreover  empirical studies using data from advanced countries show that excessive credit growth contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis  93   additional downward pressure on interest rates was created by the high and rising us current account deficit  which peaked along with the housing bubble in 2006  federal reserve chairman ben bernanke explained how trade deficits required the us to borrow money from abroad  in the process bidding up bond prices and lowering interest rates  94   bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004  the us current account deficit increased by $650\xa0billion  from 1.5  to 5.8  of gdp  financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad  much of it from countries running trade surpluses  these were mainly the emerging economies in asia and oil-exporting nations  the balance of payments identity requires that a country  such as the us  running a current account deficit also have a capital account  investment  surplus of the same amount  hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds  capital  flowed into the us to finance its imports   all of this created demand for various types of financial assets  raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates  foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates  as high as 40  in china  or because of high oil prices  ben bernanke has referred to this as a  saving glut   95   a flood of funds  capital or liquidity  reached the us financial markets  foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing treasury bonds and thus avoided much of the direct effect of the crisis  us households  on the other hand  used funds borrowed from foreigners to finance consumption or to bid up the prices of housing and financial assets  financial institutions invested foreign funds in mortgage-backed securities   the fed then raised the fed funds rate significantly between july 2004 and july 2006.[96  this contributed to an increase in 1-year and 5-year adjustable-rate mortgage  arm  rates  making arm interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners  97  this may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble  as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates  and it became riskier to speculate in housing  98][99  us housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst  100][101   subprime lending standards declined  in the early 2000  a subprime borrower had a fico score of 660 or less  by 2005  many lenders dropped the required fico score to 620  making it much easier to qualify for prime loans and making subprime lending a riskier business  proof of income and assets were de-emphasized  loans moved from full documentation to low documentation to no documentation  one subprime mortgage product that gained wide acceptance was the no income  no job  no asset verification required  ninja  mortgage  informally  these loans were aptly referred to as  liar loans  because they encouraged borrowers to be less than honest in the loan application process  102  testimony given to the financial crisis inquiry commission by richard m  bowen iii on events during his tenure as the business chief underwriter for correspondent lending in the consumer lending group for citigroup  where he was responsible for over 220 professional underwriters  suggests that by the final years of the us housing bubble (2006\u20132007   the collapse of mortgage underwriting standards was endemic  his testimony stated that by 2006  60  of mortgages purchased by citi from some 1,600 mortgage companies were  defective   were not underwritten to policy  or did not contain all policy-required documents  u2014this  despite the fact that each of these 1,600 originators was contractually responsible  certified via representations and warrantees  that its mortgage originations met citi s standards  moreover  during 2007   defective mortgages  from mortgage originators contractually bound to perform underwriting to citi s standards  increased    to over 80  of production   103   in separate testimony to financial crisis inquiry commission  officers of clayton holdings \u2013 the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the united states and europe u2014testified that clayton s review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from january 2006 to june 2007 revealed that scarcely 54  of the loans met their originators u2019 underwriting standards  the analysis  conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks  including 7  too big to fail  banks  additionally showed that 28  of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer  clayton s analysis further showed that 39  of these loans  i e  those not meeting any issuer s minimal underwriting standards  were subsequently securitized and sold to investors  104][105   there is strong evidence that the gses u2014due to their large size and market power u2014were far more effective at policing underwriting by originators and forcing underwriters to repurchase defective loans  by contrast  private securitizers have been far less aggressive and less effective in recovering losses from originators on behalf of investors  28   predatory lending refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders  enticing borrowers to enter into  unsafe  or  unsound  secured loans for inappropriate purposes  106   a classic bait-and-switch method was used by countrywide financial  advertising low interest rates for home refinancing  such loans were covered by very detailed contracts  and swapped for more expensive loan products on the day of closing  whereas the advertisement might state that 1  or 1.5  interest would be charged  the consumer would be put into an adjustable rate mortgage  arm  in which the interest charged would be greater than the mortgage payments  creating negative amortization which the credit consumer might not notice until long after the loan transaction had been consummated   countrywide  sued by california attorney general jerry brown for  unfair business practices  and  false advertising  was making high cost mortgages  to homeowners with weak credit  adjustable rate mortgages  arms  that allowed homeowners to make interest-only payments   107  when housing prices decreased  homeowners in arms then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments  since their home equity had disappeared  this caused countrywide s financial condition to deteriorate  ultimately resulting in a decision by the office of thrift supervision to seize the lender   former employees from ameriquest  which was united states  leading wholesale lender  108  described a system in which they were pushed to falsify mortgage documents and then sell the mortgages to wall street banks eager to make fast profits  108  there is growing evidence that such mortgage frauds may be a cause of the crisis  108   a 2012 oecd study 109  suggest that bank regulation based on the basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis  in other cases  laws were changed or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system  key examples include   prior to the crisis  financial institutions became highly leveraged  increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses  much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as off-balance sheet securitization and derivatives  which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels  30  these instruments also made it virtually impossible to reorganize financial institutions in bankruptcy  and contributed to the need for government bailouts  30   us households and financial institutions became increasingly indebted or overleveraged during the years preceding the crisis  126  this increased their vulnerability to the collapse of the housing bubble and worsened the ensuing economic downturn  127  key statistics include   free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from $627\xa0billion in 2001 to $1,428\xa0billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built  a total of nearly $5\xa0trillion over the period  contributing to economic growth worldwide  128][129][130  us home mortgage debt relative to gdp increased from an average of 46  during the 1990s to 73  during 2008  reaching $10.5\xa0trillion  131   us household debt as a percentage of annual disposable personal income was 127  at the end of 2007  versus 77  in 1990.[126  in 1981  us private debt was 123  of gdp  by the third quarter of 2008  it was 290%.[132   from 2004 to 2007  the top five us investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage  see diagram   which increased their vulnerability to a financial shock  changes in capital requirements  intended to keep us banks competitive with their european counterparts  allowed lower risk weightings for aaa securities  the shift from first-loss tranches to aaa tranches was seen by regulators as a risk reduction that compensated the higher leverage  133  these five institutions reported over $4.1\xa0trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007  about 30  of us nominal gdp for 2007  lehman brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated  bear stearns and merrill lynch were sold at fire-sale prices  and goldman sachs and morgan stanley became commercial banks  subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation  with the exception of lehman  these companies required or received government support  134  lehman reported that it had been in talks with bank of america and barclays for the company s possible sale  however  both barclays and bank of america ultimately declined to purchase the entire company  135   fannie mae and freddie mac  two us government-sponsored enterprises  owned or guaranteed nearly $5\xa0trillion in mortgage obligations at the time they were placed into conservatorship by the us government in september 2008.[136][137   these seven entities were highly leveraged and had $9\xa0trillion in debt or guarantee obligations  yet they were not subject to the same regulation as depository banks  117][138   behavior that may be optimal for an individual  e g   saving more during adverse economic conditions  can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior  as ultimately one person s consumption is another person s income  too many consumers attempting to save  or pay down debt  simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession  economist hyman minsky also described a  paradox of deleveraging  as financial institutions that have too much leverage  debt relative to equity  cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets  127   during april 2009  us federal reserve vice-chair janet yellen discussed these paradoxes   once this massive credit crunch hit  it didn t take long before we were in a recession  the recession  in turn  deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell  and credit losses of financial institutions surged  indeed  we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year  a process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy  consumers are pulling back on purchases  especially on durable goods  to build their savings  businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash  and  financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm  once again  minsky understood this dynamic  he spoke of the paradox of deleveraging  in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms u2014and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state u2014nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole  127   the term financial innovation refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives  such as offsetting a particular risk exposure  such as the default of a borrower  or to assist with obtaining financing  examples pertinent to this crisis included  the adjustable-rate mortgage  the bundling of subprime mortgages into mortgage-backed securities  mbs  or collateralized debt obligations  cdo  for sale to investors  a type of securitization  and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps  cds   the usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis  these products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions   cdo issuance grew from an estimated $20 billion in q1 2004 to its peak of over $180 billion by q1 2007  then declined back under $20 billion by q1 2008  further  the credit quality of cdo s declined from 2000 to 2007  as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5  to 36  of cdo assets  139  as described in the section on subprime lending  the cds and portfolio of cds called synthetic cdo enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding  provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found  for example  buying a cds to insure a cdo ended up giving the seller the same risk as if they owned the cdo  when those cdo s became worthless  140   this boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity  it multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage  including mortgage brokers  specialized originators  the securitizers and their due diligence firms  managing agents and trading desks  and finally investors  insurances and providers of repo funding   with increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information  including fico scores on creditworthiness  appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations  and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks   instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts  misjudgments and finally market collapse  141   martin wolf further wrote in june 2009 that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations  such as off-balance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks  stating      an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade u2014the off-balance-sheet vehicles  the derivatives and the  shadow banking system  itself u2014was to find a way round regulation   142   the pricing of risk refers to the incremental compensation required by investors for taking on additional risk  which may be measured by interest rates or fees  several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks  risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis  enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have  and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward  readily understandable format  28][30   for a variety of reasons  market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as mbs and cdos or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system  39  for example  the pricing model for cdos clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system  banks estimated that $450bn of cdo were sold between  late 2005 to the middle of 2007   among the $102bn of those that had been liquidated  jpmorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for  high quality  cdos was approximately 32\xa0cents on the dollar  while the recovery rate for mezzanine cdo was approximately five cents for every dollar  143   another example relates to aig  which insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps  the basic cds transaction involved aig receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party a in the event party b defaulted  however  aig did not have the financial strength to support its many cds commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in september 2008  us taxpayers provided over $180\xa0billion in government support to aig during 2008 and early 2009  through which the money flowed to various counterparties to cds transactions  including many large global financial institutions  144][145   the financial crisis inquiry commission  fcic  made the major government study of the crisis  it concluded in january 2011   the commission concludes aig failed and was rescued by the government primarily because its enormous sales of credit default swaps were made without putting up the initial collateral  setting aside capital reserves  or hedging its exposure \u2013 a profound failure in corporate governance  particularly its risk management practices  aig s failure was possible because of the sweeping deregulation of over-the-counter  otc  derivatives  including credit default swaps  which effectively eliminated federal and state regulation of these products  including capital and margin requirements that would have lessened the likelihood of aig s failure  146][147][148   the limitations of a widely used financial model also were not properly understood  149][150  this formula assumed that the price of cds was correlated with and could predict the correct price of mortgage-backed securities  because it was highly tractable  it rapidly came to be used by a huge percentage of cdo and cds investors  issuers  and rating agencies  150  according to one wired com article   then the model fell apart  cracks started appearing early on  when financial markets began behaving in ways that users of li s formula hadn t expected  the cracks became full-fledged canyons in 2008\u2014when ruptures in the financial system s foundation swallowed up trillions of dollars and put the survival of the global banking system in serious peril    li s gaussian copula formula will go down in history as instrumental in causing the unfathomable losses that brought the world financial system to its knees  150   as financial assets became more complex and harder to value  investors were reassured by the fact that the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators accepted as valid some complex mathematical models that showed the risks were much smaller than they actually were  151  george soros commented that  the super-boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves  similarly  the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products  it was a shocking abdication of responsibility   152   moreover  a conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients  combined with a global glut in investment capital  led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets  professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management  there is  therefore  an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation  as the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline  asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients  many asset managers continued to invest client funds in over-priced  under-yielding  investments  to the detriment of their clients  so they could maintain their assets under management  they supported this choice with a  plausible deniability  of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early  vintages  of subprime loans was so low  153   despite the dominance of the above formula  there are documented attempts of the financial industry  occurring before the crisis  to address the formula limitations  specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events  154  the volume  credit correlation  life after copulas   published in 2007 by world scientific  summarizes a 2006 conference held by merrill lynch in london where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations  see also the article by donnelly and embrechts 155  and the book by brigo  pallavicini and torresetti  that reports relevant warnings and research on cdos appeared in 2006.[156   mortgage risks were underestimated by every institution in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices based on historical trends of the past 50 years  limitations of default and prepayment models  the heart of pricing models  led to overvaluation of mortgage and asset-backed products and their derivatives by originators  securitizers  broker-dealers  rating-agencies  insurance underwriters and investors  [157][158   there is strong evidence that the riskiest  worst performing mortgages were funded through the  shadow banking system  and that competition from the shadow banking system may have pressured more traditional institutions to lower their own underwriting standards and originate riskier loans  28   in a june 2008 speech  president and ceo of the new york federal reserve bank timothy geithner u2014who in 2009 became secretary of the united states treasury u2014placed significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a  run  on the entities in the  parallel  banking system  also called the shadow banking system  these entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system  but were not subject to the same regulatory controls  further  these entities were vulnerable because of maturity mismatch  meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term  illiquid and risky assets  this meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging  selling their long-term assets at depressed prices  he described the significance of these entities   in early 2007  asset-backed commercial paper conduits  in structured investment vehicles  in auction-rate preferred securities  tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes  had a combined asset size of roughly $2.2\xa0trillion  assets financed overnight in triparty repo grew to $2.5\xa0trillion  assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly $1.8\xa0trillion  the combined balance sheets of the then five major investment banks totaled $4\xa0trillion  in comparison  the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the united states at that point were just over $6\xa0trillion  and total assets of the entire banking system were about $10\xa0trillion  the combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to self-reinforcing asset price and credit cycles  50   paul krugman  laureate of the nobel prize in economics  described the run on the shadow banking system as the  core of what happened  to cause the crisis  he referred to this lack of controls as  malign neglect  and argued that regulation should have been imposed on all banking-like activity  117   the securitization markets supported by the shadow banking system started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut-down in the fall of 2008  more than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds  159  according to the brookings institution  the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of june 2009   it would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume   the authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are  likely to vanish forever  having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions   160   rapid increases in a number of commodity prices followed the collapse in the housing bubble  the price of oil nearly tripled from $50 to $147 from early 2007 to 2008  before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008.[161  experts debate the causes  with some attributing it to speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities  some to monetary policy  162  and some to the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast-growing world  leading to long positions taken on those markets  such as chinese increasing presence in africa  an increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline  which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries  as wealth flows to oil-producing states  163  a pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the decade leading up to the price high of 2008 has been recently identified  164  the destabilizing effects of this price variance has been proposed as a contributory factor in the financial crisis   copper prices increased at the same time as oil prices  copper traded at about $2,500 per ton from 1990 until 1999  when it fell to about $1,600  the price slump lasted until 2004  when a price surge pushed copper to $7,040 per ton in 2008.[165   nickel prices boomed in the late 1990s  then declined from around $51,000 /\xa336,700 per metric ton in may 2007 to about $11,550/\xa38,300 per metric ton in january 2009  prices were only just starting to recover as of january 2010  but most of australia s nickel mines had gone bankrupt by then  166  as the price for high grade nickel sulphate ore recovered in 2010  so did the australian nickel mining industry  167   coincidentally with these price fluctuations  long-only commodity index funds became popular u2014by one estimate investment increased from $90\xa0billion in 2006 to $200\xa0billion at the end of 2007  while commodity prices increased 71  \u2013 which raised concern as to whether these index funds caused the commodity bubble  168  the empirical research has been mixed  168   another analysis  different from the mainstream explanation  is that the financial crisis is merely a symptom of another  deeper crisis  which is a systemic crisis of capitalism itself  169   ravi batra s theory is that growing inequality of financial capitalism produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major political changes  he has also suggested that a  demand gap  related to differing wage and productivity growth explains deficit and debt dynamics important to stock market developments  170   john bellamy foster  a political economy analyst and editor of the monthly review  believes that the decrease in gdp growth rates since the early 1970s is due to increasing market saturation  171   in 2005  john c  bogle wrote that a series of challenges face capitalism that have contributed to past financial crises and have not been sufficiently addressed   corporate america went astray largely because the power of managers went virtually unchecked by our gatekeepers for far too long    they failed to  keep an eye on these geniuses  to whom they had entrusted the responsibility of the management of america s great corporations   echoing the central thesis of james burnham s 1941 seminal book  the managerial revolution  bogle cites particular issues  including  172   an analysis conducted by mark roeder  a former executive at the swiss-based ubs bank  suggested that large-scale momentum  or the big mo  played a pivotal role  in the 2008\u201309 global financial crisis  roeder suggested that  recent technological advances  such as computer-driven trading programs  together with the increasingly interconnected nature of markets  has magnified the momentum effect  this has made the financial sector inherently unstable   173   robert reich attributes the current economic downturn to the stagnation of wages in the united states  particularly those of the hourly workers who comprise 80  of the workforce  he says this stagnation forced the population to borrow to meet the cost of living  174   economists ailsa mckay and margunn bj xf8rnholt argue that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession  and call for a reshaping of both the economy  economic theory and the economics profession  175   the former governor of the reserve bank of india raghuram rajan had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the international monetary fund in 2005  at a celebration honouring alan greenspan  who was about to retire as chairman of the us federal reserve  rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector  176  in that paper   has financial development made the world riskier    rajan  argued that disaster might loom   177  rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to  take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but  in return  offer generous compensation the rest of the time  these risks are known as tail risks  but perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialise  financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimised    the financial crisis was not widely predicted by mainstream economists except raghuram rajan  who instead spoke of the great moderation  a number of heterodox economists predicted the crisis  with varying arguments  dirk bezemer in his research 178  credits  with supporting argument and estimates of timing  12 economists with predicting the crisis  dean baker  us   wynne godley  uk   fred harrison  uk   michael hudson  us   eric

examples of other experts who gave indications of a financial crisis have also been given  179][180][181  not surprisingly  the austrian economic school regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable credit-fueled bubble that could not forestall the disregarded but inevitable effect of an artificial  manufactured laxity in monetary supply  182  a perspective that even former fed chair alan greenspan in congressional testimony confessed himself forced to return to  183   a cover story in businessweek magazine claims that economists mostly failed to predict the worst international economic crisis since the great depression of the 1930s  184  the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania s online business journal examines why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis  185  popular articles published in the mass media have led the general public to believe that the majority of economists have failed in their obligation to predict the financial crisis  for example  an article in the new york times informs that economist nouriel roubini warned of such crisis as early as september 2006  and the article goes on to state that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions  186  according to the guardian  roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession  while the new york times labelled him  dr  doom   187   shiller  an expert in housing markets  wrote an article a year before the collapse of lehman brothers in which he predicted that a slowing us housing market would cause the housing bubble to burst  leading to financial collapse  188  schiff regularly appeared on television in the years before the crisis and warned of the impending real estate collapse  189   within mainstream financial economics  most believe that financial crises are simply unpredictable  190  following eugene fama s efficient-market hypothesis and the related random-walk hypothesis  which state respectively that markets contain all information about possible future movements  and that the movements of financial prices are random and unpredictable  recent research casts doubt on the accuracy of  early warning  systems of potential crises  which must also predict their timing  191   stock trader and financial risk engineer nassim nicholas taleb  author of the 2007 book the black swan  spent years warning against the breakdown of the banking system in particular and the economy in general owing to their use of bad risk models and reliance on forecasting  and their reliance on bad models  and framed the problem as part of  robustness and fragility   192][193  he also took action against the establishment view by making a big financial bet on banking stocks and making a fortune from the crisis   they didn t listen  so i took their money    194  according to david brooks from the new york times   taleb not only has an explanation for what u2019s happening  he saw it coming   195   the us stock market peaked in october 2007  when the dow jones industrial average index exceeded 14,000 points  it then entered a pronounced decline  which accelerated markedly in october 2008  by march 2009  the dow jones average had reached a trough of around 6,600  four years later  it hit an all-time high  it is probable  but debated  that the federal reserve s aggressive policy of quantitative easing spurred the partial recovery in the stock market  196][197][198   market strategist phil dow believes distinctions exist  between the current market malaise  and the great depression  he says the dow jones average s fall of more than 50  over a period of 17 months is similar to a 54.7  fall in the great depression  followed by a total drop of 89  over the following 16 months   it s very troubling if you have a mirror image   said dow  199  floyd norris  the chief financial correspondent of the new york times  wrote in a blog entry in march 2009 that the decline has not been a mirror image of the great depression  explaining that although the decline amounts were nearly the same at the time  the rates of decline had started much faster in 2007  and that the past year had only ranked eighth among the worst recorded years of percentage drops in the dow  the past two years ranked third  however  200   the first notable event signaling a possible financial crisis occurred in the united kingdom on august 9  2007  when bnp paribas  citing  a complete evaporation of liquidity   blocked withdrawals from three hedge funds  the significance of this event was not immediately recognized but soon led to a panic as investors and savers attempted to liquidate assets deposited in highly leveraged financial institutions  24   the international monetary fund estimated that large us and european banks lost more than $1\xa0trillion on toxic assets and from bad loans from january 2007 to september 2009  these losses are expected to top $2.8\xa0trillion from 2007 to 2010  us bank losses were forecast to hit $1\xa0trillion and european bank losses will reach $1.6\xa0trillion  the international monetary fund  imf  estimated that us banks were about 60  through their losses  but british and eurozone banks only 40%.[201   one of the first victims was northern rock  a medium-sized british bank  202  the highly leveraged nature of its business led the bank to request security from the bank of england  this in turn led to investor panic and a bank run 203  in mid-september 2007  calls by liberal democrat treasury spokesman vince cable to nationalise the institution were initially ignored  in february 2008  however  the british government  having failed to find a private sector buyer  relented  and the bank was taken into public hands  northern rock s problems proved to be an early indication of the troubles that would soon befall other banks and financial institutions   the first visible institution to run into trouble in the united states was the southern california u2013based indymac  a spin-off of countrywide financial  before its failure  indymac bank was the largest savings and loan association in the los angeles market and the seventh largest mortgage originator in the united states  204  the failure of indymac bank on july 11  2008  was the fourth largest bank failure in united states history up until the crisis precipitated even larger failures  205  and the second largest failure of a regulated thrift  206  indymac bank s parent corporation was indymac bancorp until the fdic seized indymac bank  207  indymac bancorp filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in july 2008.[207   indymac bank was founded as countrywide mortgage investment in 1985 by david s  loeb and angelo mozilo 208][209  as a means of collateralizing countrywide financial loans too big to be sold to freddie mac and fannie mae  in 1997  countrywide spun off indymac as an independent company run by mike perry  who remained its ceo until the downfall of the bank in july 2008.[210   the primary causes of its failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing alt-a loans on a large scale  this strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets  from its inception as a savings association in 2000  indymac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the united states  during 2006  indymac originated over $90 billion of mortgages   indymac u2019s aggressive growth strategy  use of alt-a and other nontraditional loan products  insufficient underwriting  credit concentrations in residential real estate in the california and florida markets u2014states  alongside nevada and arizona  where the housing bubble was most pronounced u2014and heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a federal home loan bank  fhlb  and from brokered deposits  led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007   indymac often made loans without verification of the borrower u2019s income or assets  and to borrowers with poor credit histories  appraisals obtained by indymac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well  as an alt-a lender  indymac u2019s business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower u2019s needs  using an extensive array of risky option-adjustable-rate-mortgages  option arms   subprime loans  80/20 loans  and other nontraditional products  ultimately  loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments  the thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the secondary mortgage market  indymac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria  see the comment by ruthann melbourne  chief risk officer  to the regulating agencies  211][212][213   may 12  2008  in a small note in the  capital  section of its what would become its last 10-q released before receivership  indymac revealed \u2013 but did not admit \u2013 that it was no longer a well-capitalized institution and that it was headed for insolvency   indymac reported that during april 2008  moody s and standard  amp  poor s downgraded the ratings on a significant number of mortgage-backed security  mbs  bonds u2014including $160 million issued by indymac that the bank retained in its mbs portfolio  indymac concluded that these downgrades would have harmed the company s risk-based capital ratio as of june 30  2008  had these lowered ratings been in effect at march 31  2008  indymac concluded that the bank s capital ratio would have been 9.27  total risk-based  indymac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below  well capitalized   minimum 10  risk-based capital ratio  to  adequately capitalized  (8\u201310  risk-based capital ratio  the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds   senator charles schumer  d-ny  later pointed out that brokered deposits made up more than 37 percent of indymac s total deposits  and ask the federal deposit insurance corporation  fdic  whether it had considered ordering indymac to reduce its reliance on these deposits  214  with $18.9 billion in total deposits reported on march 31,[215  senator schumer would have been referring to a little over $7 billion in brokered deposits  while the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly  a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits

interest payments on some preferred securities  dividends on common shares had already been suspended for the first quarter of 2008  after being cut in half the previous quarter  the company still had not secured a significant capital infusion nor found a ready buyer  216][217   indymac reported that the bank s risk-based capital was only $47 million above the minimum required for this 10  mark  but it did not reveal some of that $47 million capital it claimed it had  as of march 31  2008  was fabricated   when home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed  indymac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market  its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late june 2008 when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion or about 7.5  of indymac s deposits  218  this \u201crun u201d on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from senator charles schumer to the fdic and ots  the letter outlined the senator u2019s concerns with indymac  while the run was a contributing factor in the timing of indymac u2019s demise  the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound way they operated the thrift  211   on june 26  2008  senator charles schumer  d-ny   a member of the senate banking committee  chairman of congress  joint economic committee and the third-ranking democrat in the senate  219  released several letters he had sent to regulators  which warned that   the possible collapse of big mortgage lender indymac bancorp inc  poses significant financial risks to its borrowers and depositors  and regulators may not be ready to intervene to protect them   some worried depositors began to withdraw money  220   on july 7  2008  indymac announced on the company blog that it   indymac announced the closure of both its retail lending and wholesale divisions  halted new loan submissions  and cut 3,800 jobs  221   on july 11  2008  citing liquidity concerns  the fdic

the fdic announced plans to open indymac federal bank  fsb on july 14  2008  until then  depositors would have access their insured deposits through atms  their existing checks  and their existing debit cards  telephone and internet account access was restored when the bank reopened  222][223][224  the fdic guarantees the funds of all insured accounts up to us 100,000  and has declared a

indymac to imb management holdings  an estimated 10,000 uninsured depositors of indymac are still at a loss of over $270 million  225][226   with $32 billion in assets  indymac bank was one of the largest bank failures in american history   indymac bancorp filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy on july 31  2008.[207   initially the companies affected were those directly involved in home construction

provide funds to mortgage firms and other corporations  50][117   this meant that nearly one-third of the us lending mechanism was frozen and continued to be frozen into june 2009.[159  according to the brookings institution  the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of june 2009   it would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume   the authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are  likely to vanish forever  having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions   while traditional banks have raised their lending standards  it was the collapse of the shadow banking system that is the primary cause of the reduction in funds available for borrowing  233   there is a direct relationship between declines in wealth and declines in consumption and business investment  which along with government spending  represent the economic engine  between june 2007 and november 2008  americans lost an estimated average of more than a quarter of their collective net worth  citation needed  by early november 2008  a broad us stock index the s amp p 500  was down 45  from its 2007 high  housing prices had dropped 20  from their 2006 peak  with futures markets signaling a 30\u201335  potential drop  total home equity in the united states  which was valued at $13\xa0trillion at its peak in 2006  had dropped to $8.8\xa0trillion by mid-2008 and was still falling in late 2008  total retirement assets  americans  second-largest household asset  dropped by 22   from $10.3\xa0trillion in 2006 to $8\xa0trillion in mid-2008  during the same period  savings and investment assets  apart from retirement savings  lost $1.2\xa0trillion and pension assets lost $1.3\xa0trillion  taken together  these losses total a staggering $8.3\xa0trillion  227  since peaking in the second quarter of 2007  household wealth is down xa0$14\xa0trillion  234   further  us homeowners had extracted significant equity in their homes in the years leading up to the crisis  which they could no longer do once housing prices collapsed  free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from $627\xa0billion in 2001 to $1,428\xa0billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built  a total of nearly $5\xa0trillion over the period  128][129][130  us home mortgage debt relative to gdp increased from an average of 46  during the 1990s to 73  during 2008  reaching $10.5\xa0trillion  131   to offset this decline in consumption and lending capacity  the us government and us federal reserve have committed $13.9\xa0trillion  of which $6.8\xa0trillion has been invested or spent  as of june 2009.[235  in effect  the fed has gone from being the  lender of last resort  to the  lender of only resort  for a significant portion of the economy  in some cases the fed can now be considered the  buyer of last resort    in november 2008  economist dean baker observed   there is a really good reason for tighter credit  tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today  businesses are facing the worst downturn since the great depression  this matters for credit decisions  a homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt  they will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and or have a default placed on their credit record  on the other hand  a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk  in the case of businesses  their creditworthiness depends on their future profits  profit prospects look much worse in november 2008 than they did in november 2007    while many banks are obviously at the brink  consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid  the problem with the economy is the loss of close to $6\xa0trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth  236   at the heart of the portfolios of many of these institutions were investments whose assets had been derived from bundled home mortgages  exposure to these mortgage-backed securities  or to the credit derivatives used to insure them against failure  caused the collapse or takeover of several key firms such as lehman brothers  aig  merrill lynch  and hbos  237][238][239   the crisis rapidly developed and spread into a global economic shock  resulting in a number of european bank failures  declines in various stock indexes  and large reductions in the market value of equities 240  and commodities  241   both mbs and cdo were purchased by corporate and institutional investors globally  derivatives such as credit default swaps also increased the linkage between large financial institutions  moreover  the de-leveraging of financial institutions  as assets were sold to pay back obligations that could not be refinanced in frozen credit markets  further accelerated the solvency crisis and caused a decrease in international trade   world political leaders  national ministers of finance and central bank directors coordinated their efforts to reduce fears  but the crisis continued  242  at the end of october 2008 a currency crisis developed  with investors transferring vast capital resources into stronger currencies such as the yen  the dollar and the swiss franc  leading many emergent economies to seek aid from the international monetary fund  243][244   several commentators have suggested that if the liquidity crisis continues  an extended recession or worse could occur  245  the continuing development of the crisis has prompted fears of a global economic collapse although there are now many cautiously optimistic forecasters in addition to some prominent sources who remain negative  246  the financial crisis is likely to yield the biggest banking shakeout since the savings-and-loan meltdown  247  investment bank ubs stated on october 6 that 2008 would see a clear global recession  with recovery unlikely for at least two years  248  three days later ubs economists announced that the  beginning of the end  of the crisis had begun  with the world starting to make the necessary actions to fix the crisis  capital injection by governments  injection made systemically  interest rate cuts to help borrowers  the united kingdom had started systemic injection  and the world s central banks were now cutting interest rates  ubs emphasized the united states needed to implement systemic injection  ubs further emphasized that this fixes only the financial crisis  but that in economic terms  the worst is still to come   249  ubs quantified their expected recession durations on october 16  the eurozone s would last two quarters  the united states  would last three quarters  and the united kingdom s would last four quarters  250  the economic crisis in iceland involved all three of the country s major banks  relative to the size of its economy  iceland u2019s banking collapse is the largest suffered by any country in economic history  251   at the end of october ubs revised its outlook downwards  the forthcoming recession would be the worst since the early 1980s recession with negative 2009 growth for the us  eurozone  uk  very limited recovery in 2010  but not as bad as the great depression  252   the brookings institution reported in june 2009 that us consumption accounted for more than a third of the growth in global consumption between 2000 and 2007   the us economy has been spending too much and borrowing too much for years and the rest of the world depended on the us consumer as a source of global demand   with a recession in the us and the increased savings rate of us consumers  declines in growth elsewhere have been dramatic  for the first quarter of 2009  the annualized rate of decline in gdp was 14.4  in germany  15.2  in japan  7.4  in the uk  18  in latvia  253  9.8  in the euro area and 21.5  for mexico  254   some developing countries that had seen strong economic growth saw significant slowdowns  for example  growth forecasts in cambodia show a fall from more than 10  in 2007 to close to zero in 2009  and kenya may achieve only 3\u20134  growth in 2009  down from 7  in 2007  according to the research by the overseas development institute  reductions in growth can be attributed to falls in trade  commodity prices  investment and remittances sent from migrant workers  which reached a record $251\xa0billion in 2007  but have fallen in many countries since   255  this has stark implications and has led to a dramatic rise in the number of households living below the poverty line  be it 300,000 in bangladesh or 230,000 in ghana  255  especially states with a fragile political system have to fear that investors from western states withdraw their money because of the crisis  bruno wenn of the german deg recommends to provide a sound economic policymaking and good governance to attract new investors 256   the world bank reported in february 2009 that the arab world was far less severely affected by the credit crunch  with generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits  such as remittances  foreign direct investment  fdi  or foreign aid  arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008  this group is in the best position to absorb the economic shocks  they entered the crisis in exceptionally strong positions  this gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn  the greatest effect of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices  which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance  steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments  significantly lower oil prices could cause a reversal of economic performance as has been the case in past oil shocks  initial impact will be seen on public finances and employment for foreign workers  257   the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the united states u2014decreased at an annual rate of approximately 6  in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009  versus activity in the year-ago periods  258  the us unemployment rate increased to 10.1  by october 2009  the highest rate since 1983 and roughly twice the pre-crisis rate  the average hours per work week declined to 33  the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in 1964.[259][260  with the decline of gross domestic product came the decline in innovation  with fewer resources to risk in creative destruction  the number of patent applications flat-lined  compared to the previous 5 years of exponential increases in patent application  this stagnation correlates to the similar drop in gdp during the same time period  261   typical american families did not fare as well  nor did those  wealthy-but-not wealthiest  families just beneath the pyramid s top  on the other hand  half of the poorest families did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis  the federal reserve surveyed 4,000 households between 2007 and 2009  and found that the total wealth of 63 percent of all americans declined in that period  77 percent of the richest families had a decrease in total wealth  while only 50 percent of those on the bottom of the pyramid suffered a decrease  262][263][264   on november 3  2008  the european commission at brussels predicted for 2009 an extremely weak growth of gdp  by 0.1   for the countries of the eurozone  france  germany  italy  belgium etc   and even negative number for the uk (\u22121.0    ireland and spain  on november 6  the imf at washington  d c   launched numbers predicting a worldwide recession by \u22120.3  for 2009  averaged over the developed economies  on the same day  the bank of england and the european central bank  respectively  reduced their interest rates from 4.5  down to 3   and from 3.75  down to 3.25   as a consequence  starting from november 2008  several countries launched large  help packages  for their economies   the us federal reserve open market committee release in june 2009 stated      the pace of economic contraction is slowing  conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months  household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses  lower housing wealth  and tight credit  businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales  although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time  the committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions  fiscal and monetary stimulus  and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability  265  economic projections from the federal reserve and reserve bank presidents include a return to typical growth levels  gdp  of 2.5\u20133  in 2010  an unemployment plateau in 2009 and 2010 around 10  with moderation in 2011  and inflation that remains at typical levels around 1\u20132%.[266   the us federal reserve and central banks around the world took steps to expand money supplies to avoid the risk of a deflationary spiral  in which lower wages and higher unemployment led to a self-reinforcing decline in global consumption  in addition  governments enacted large fiscal stimulus packages  by borrowing and spending to offset the reduction in private sector demand caused by the crisis  the us federal reserve s new and expanded liquidity facilities were intended to enable the central bank to fulfill its traditional lender-of-last-resort role during the crisis while mitigating stigma  broadening the set of institutions with access to liquidity  and increasing the flexibility with which institutions could tap such liquidity  267   this credit freeze brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse  the response of the federal reserve  the european central bank  the bank of england and other central banks was immediate and dramatic  during the last quarter of 2008  these central banks purchased us 2.5\xa0trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks  this was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market  and the largest monetary policy action  in world history  following a model initiated by the united kingdom bank rescue package  268][269  the governments of european nations and the us guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems  ultimately purchasing $1.5\xa0trillion newly issued preferred stock in their major banks  227  in october 2010  nobel laureate joseph stiglitz explained how the us federal reserve was implementing another monetary policy \u2014creating currency u2014 as a method to combat the liquidity trap  270  by creating $600 billion and inserting clarification needed  this directly into banks  the federal reserve intended to spur banks to finance more domestic loans and refinance mortgages  however  banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets  banks were also investing in foreign currencies  which stiglitz and others point out may lead to currency wars while china redirects its currency holdings away from the united states  271   governments have also bailed out a variety of firms as discussed above  incurring large financial obligations  to date  various us government agencies have committed or spent trillions of dollars in loans  asset purchases  guarantees  and direct spending  272  significant controversy has accompanied the bailout  leading to the development of a variety of  decision making frameworks   to help balance competing policy interests during times of financial crisis  273   the us executed two stimulus packages  totaling nearly $1\xa0trillion during 2008 and 2009.[274  other countries also implemented fiscal stimulus plans beginning in 2008   united states president barack obama and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in june 2009  the proposals address consumer protection  executive pay  bank financial cushions or capital requirements  expanded regulation of the shadow banking system and derivatives  and enhanced authority for the federal reserve to safely wind-down systemically important institutions  among others  275][276][277  in january 2010  obama proposed additional regulations limiting the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading  the proposals were dubbed  the volcker rule   in recognition of paul volcker  who has publicly argued for the proposed changes  278][279   the us senate passed a reform bill in may 2010  following the house  which passed a bill in december 2009  these bills must now be reconciled  the new york times provided a comparative summary of the features of the two bills  which address to varying extent the principles enumerated by the obama administration  280  for instance  the volcker rule against proprietary trading is not part of the legislation  though in the senate bill regulators have the discretion but not the obligation to prohibit these trades   european regulators introduced basel iii regulations for banks  281  it increased capital ratios  limits on leverage  narrow definition of capital  to exclude subordinated debt   limit counter-party risk  and new liquidity requirements  282  critics argue that basel iii doesn u2019t address the problem of faulty risk-weightings  major banks suffered losses from aaa-rated created by financial engineering  which creates apparently risk-free assets out of high risk collateral  that required less capital according to basel ii  lending to aa-rated sovereigns has a risk-weight of zero  thus increasing lending to governments and leading to the next crisis  283  johan norberg argues that regulations  basel iii among others  have indeed led to excessive lending to risky governments  see european sovereign-debt crisis  and the ecb pursues even more lending as the solution  284   at least two major reports were produced by congress  the financial crisis inquiry commission report  released january 2011  and a report by the united states senate homeland security permanent subcommittee on investigations entitled wall street and the financial crisis  anatomy of a financial collapse  released april 2011    in iceland in april 2012  the special landsd xf3mur court convicted former prime minister geir haarde of mishandling the 2008\u20132012 icelandic financial crisis   as of september 2011  no individuals in the uk have been prosecuted for misdeeds during the financial meltdown of 2008.[289   as of 2012  in the united states  a large volume of troubled mortgages remained in place  it had proved impossible for most homeowners facing foreclosure to refinance or modify their mortgages and foreclosure rates remained high  290   the us recession that began in december 2007 ended in june 2009  according to the us national bureau of economic research (nber  291  and the financial crisis appears to have ended about the same time  in april 2009 time magazine declared  more quickly than it began  the banking crisis is over   292  the united states financial crisis inquiry commission dates the crisis to 2008.[293][294  president barack obama declared on january 27  2010   the markets are now stabilized  and we ve recovered most of the money we spent on the banks   295   the new york times identifies march 2009 as the  nadir of the crisis  and noted in 2011 that  most stock markets around the world are at least 75 percent higher than they were then  financial stocks  which led the markets down  have also led them up   nevertheless  the lack of fundamental changes in banking and financial markets  worries many market participants  including the international monetary fund  296   the distribution of household incomes in the united states has become more unequal during the post-2008 economic recovery  a first for the us but in line with the trend over the last ten economic recoveries since 1949.[297][298  income inequality in the united states has grown from 2005 to 2012 in more than 2 out of 3 metropolitan areas  299  median household wealth fell 35  in the us  from $106,591 to $68,839 between 2005 and 2011.[300   the financial crises generated many articles and books outside of the scholarly and financial press  including articles and books by author william greider  economist michael hudson  author and former bond salesman michael lewis  kevin phillips  and investment broker peter schiff   in may 2010  a documentary  overdose  a film about the next financial crisis  301  premiered about how the financial crisis came about and how the solutions that have been applied by many governments are setting the stage for the next crisis  the film is based on the book financial fiasco by johan norberg and features alan greenspan  with funding from the libertarian think tank the cato institute  greenspan is responsible for de-regulating the derivatives market while chairman of the federal reserve   in october 2010  a documentary film about the crisis  inside

the events and be generally less myopic  subsequent to the crisis itself some observers furthermore noted a change in social relations as some group culpability emerged  303   advanced economies led global economic growth prior to the financial crisis with  emerging  and  developing  economies lagging behind  the crisis overturned this relationship  304  the international monetary fund found that  advanced  economies accounted for only 31  of global gdp while emerging and developing economies accounted for 69  of global gdp from 2007 to 2014.[305  in the tables  the names of emergent economies
