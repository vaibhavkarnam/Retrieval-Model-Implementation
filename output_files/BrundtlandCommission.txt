BrundtlandCommission
 formally known as the world commission on environment and development  wced   the mission of brundtland commission is to unite countries to pursue sustainable development together  the chairperson of the commission  gro harlem brundtland  was appointed by javier p xe9rez de cu xe9llar  former secretary general of the united nations  in december 1983  at the time  the un general assembly realized that there was a heavy deterioration of the human environment and natural resources  to rally countries to work and pursue sustainable development together  the un decided to establish the brundtland commission  gro harlem brundtland was the former prime minister of norway and was chosen due to her strong background in the sciences and public health  the brundtland commission officially dissolved in december 1987 after releasing our common future  also known as the brundtland report  in october 1987  a document which coined  and defined the meaning of the term  sustainable development   our common future won the university of louisville grawemeyer award in 1991.[1  the organization center for our common future was started in april 1988 to take the place of the commission       ten years after the 1972 united nations conference on the human environment  most of the global environmental challenges had clearly not been adequately addressed  in several ways  these challenges had grown  particularly  the underlying problem of how to reduce poverty in low-income countries through more productive and industrialized economy without  in the process  exacerbating the global and local environmental burdens  remained unresolved  neither high-income countries in the north nor low-income countries in the south were willing to give up an economic development based on growth  but envif existing problems and ideas for their solution  similar to earlier commissions such as the independent commission on international development issues  brandt commission  and the independent commission on disarmament and security issues  palme commission   2   in december 1983  the secretary general of the united nations  javier p xe9rez de cu xe9llar  asked the prime minister of norway  gro harlem brundtland  to create an organization independent of the un to focus on environmental and developmental problems and solutions after an affirmation by the general assembly resolution in the fall of 1984 cite error  a  lt ref gt  tag is missing the closing  lt  ref gt   see the help page    to understand this paradigm shift  we start with the meaning of the key term  development   the 1983 general assembly passed resolution 38/161  process of preparation of the environmental perspective to the year 2000 and beyond   establishing the commission  3  in a res 38/161  the general assembly   the brundtland commission draws upon several notions in its definition of sustainable development  which is the most frequently cited definition of the concept to date   a key element in the definition is the unity of environment and development  the brundtland commission argues against the assertions of the 1972 stockholm conference on the human environment and provides an alternative perspective on sustainable development  unique from that of the 1980 world conservation strategy of the international union for the conservation of nature  the brundtland commission pushed for the idea that while the  environment  was previously perceived as a sphere separate from human emotion or action  and while  development  was a term habitually used to describe political goals or economic progress  it is more comprehensive to understand the two terms in relation to each other  we can better understand the environment in relation to development and we can better understand development in relation to the environment  because they cannot and should not be distinguished as separate entities   brundtland argues       the  environment  is where we live  and  development  is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode  the two are inseparable    the brundtland commission insists upon the environment being something beyond physicality  going beyond that traditional school of thought to include social and political atmospheres and circumstances  it also insists that development is not just about how poor countries can ameliorate their situation  but what the entire world  including developed countries  can do to ameliorate our common situation   the term sustainable development was coined in the paper our common future  released by the brundtland commission  sustainable development is the kind of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs  the two key concepts of sustainable development are  \u2022 the concept of  needs  in particular the essential needs of the world s poorest people  to which they should be given overriding priority  and \u2022 the idea of limitations which is imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment s ability to meet both present and future needs  4   most agree that the central idea of the brundtland commission s definition of  sustainable development  is that of intergenerational equity  in sum  the  needs  are basic and essential  economic growth will facilitate their fulfillment  and equity is encouraged by citizen participation  therefore  another characteristic that really sets this definition apart from others is the element of humanity that the brundtland commission integrates   the particular ambiguity and openness-to-interpretation of this definition has allowed for widespread support from diverse efforts  groups and organizations  however  this has also been a criticism  perceived by some notable commentators as  self-defeating and compromised rhetoric   5  it nonetheless lays out a core set of guiding principles that can be enriched by an evolving global discourse  as a result of the work of the brundtland commission  the issue of sustainable development is on the agenda of numerous international and national institutions  as well as corporations and city efforts  the definition gave light to new perspectives on the sustainability of an ever-changing planet with an ever-changing population   -brundtland commission  our common future  the report of the brundtland commission  our common future  was published by oxford university press in 1987  and was welcomed by the general assembly resolution 42/187  report of the world commission on environment and development  general assembly resolution 42/187  11 december 1987  one version with links to cited documents our common future  report of the world commission on environment and development  world commission on environment and development  1987  published as annex to general assembly document a 42/427  development and international co-operation is available   the document was the culmination of a \u201c900-day u201d international-exercise which catalogued  analysed  and synthesised written submissions and expert testimony from \u201csenior government representatives  scientists and experts  research institutes  industrialists  representatives of non-governmental organizations  and the general public u201d held at public hearings throughout the world   the brundtland commission s mandate was to  \u201c 1  re-examine the critical issues of environment and development and to formulate innovative  concrete  and realistic action proposals to deal with them  [2  strengthen international cooperation on environment and development and assess and propose new forms of cooperation that can break out of existing patterns and influence policies and events in the direction of needed change  and [3  raise the level of understanding and commitment to action on the part of individuals  voluntary organizations  businesses  institutes  and governments u201d (1987  347   \u201cthe commission focused its attention on the areas of population  food security  the loss of species and genetic resources  energy  industry  and human settlements - realizing that all of these are connected and cannot be treated in isolation one from another u201d (1987  27    the brundtland commission report recognised that human resource development in the form of poverty reduction  gender equity  and wealth redistribution was crucial to formulating strategies for environmental conservation  and it also recognised that environmental-limits to economic growth in industrialised and industrialising societies existed  as such  the report offered \u201cthe analysis  the broad remedies  and the recommendations for a sustainable course of development u201d within such societies (1987:16   however  the report was unable to identify the mode s  of production that are responsible for degradation of the environment  and in the absence of analysing the principles governing market-led economic growth  the report postulated that such growth could be reformed and expanded  this lack of analysis resulted in an obfuscated-introduction of the term sustainable development   the report deals with sustainable development and the change of politics needed for achieving it  the definition of this term in the report is quite well known and often cited   the brundtland commission was chaired by former norwegian prime minister gro harlem brundtland  politicians  civil servants  and environmental experts make up the majority of the members  members of the commission represent 21 different nations  both developed and developing countries are included   many of the members are important political figures in their home country  one example is william ruckelshaus  former head of the u s  environmental protection agency  all members of the commission were appointed by both gro harlem brundtland and mansour khalid  the chairman and vice chairman   the commission focuses on setting up networks to promote environmental stewardship  most of these networks make connections between governments and non-government entities  one such network is bill clinton s council on sustainable development  in this council government and business leaders come together to share ideas on how to encourage sustainable development  the brundtland commission has been the most successful in forming international ties between governments and multinational corporations  the 1992 and 2002 earth summits were the direct result of the brundtland commission  the international structure and scope of the brundtland commission allow multiple problems  such as deforestation and ozone depletion  to be looked at from a holistic approach  6   the three main pillars of sustainable development include economic growth  environmental protection  and social equality  while many people agree that each of these three ideas contribute to the overall idea of sustainability  it is difficult to find evidence of equal levels of initiatives for the three pillars in countries  policies worldwide  with the overwhelming number of countries that put economic growth on the forefront of sustainable development  it is evident that the other two pillars have been suffering  especially with the overall well being of the environment in a dangerously unhealthy state  the brundtland commission has put forth a conceptual framework that many nations agree with and want to try to make a difference with in their countries  but it has been difficult to change these concepts about sustainability into concrete actions and programs  implementing sustainable development globally is still a challenge  but because of the brundtland commission s efforts  progress has been made  after releasing their report  our common future  the brundtland commission called for an international meeting to take place where more concrete initiatives and goals could be mapped out  this meeting was held in rio de janeiro  brazil  a comprehensive plan of action  known as agenda xa021  came out of the meeting  agenda xa021 entailed actions to be taken globally  nationally  and locally in order to make life on earth more sustainable going into the future  7   economic growth is the pillar that most groups focus on when attempting to attain more sustainable efforts and development  in trying to build their economies  many countries focus their efforts on resource extraction  which leads to unsustainable efforts for environmental protection as well as economic growth sustainability  while the commission was able to help to change the association between economic growth and resource extraction  the total worldwide consumption of resources is projected to increase in the future  so much of the natural world has already been converted into human use that the focus cannot simply remain on economic growth and omit the ever-growing problem of environmental sustainability  agenda xa021 reinforces the importance of finding ways to generate economic growth without hurting the environment  through various trade negotiations such as improving access to markets for exports of developing countries  agenda xa021 looks to increase economic growth sustainability in countries that need it most  8   environmental protection has become more important to government and businesses over the last 20\xa0years  leading to great improvements in the number of people willing to invest in green technologies  for the second year in a row in 2010  the united states and europe added more power capacity from renewable sources such as wind and solar  in 2011 the efforts continue with 45 new wind energy projects beginning in 25 different states  9  the focus on environmental protection has transpired globally as well  including a great deal of investment in renewable energy power capacity  eco-city development occurring around the world helps to develop and implement water conservation  smart grids with renewable energy sources  led street lights and energy efficient building  the consumption gap remains  consisting of the fact that  roughly 80 percent of the natural resources used each year are consumed by about 20 percent of the world s population   this level is striking and still needs to be addressed now and throughout the future  10   the social equality and equity as pillars of sustainable development focus on the social well-being of people  the growing gap between incomes of rich and poor is evident throughout the world with the incomes of the richer households increasing relative to the incomes of middle - or lower-class households this is attributed partly to the land distribution patterns in rural areas where majority live from land  global inequality has been declining  but the world is still extremely unequal  with the richest 1  of the world u2019s population owning 40  of the world u2019s wealth and the poorest 50  owning around 1   the brundtland commission made a significant impact trying to link environment and development and thus  go away from the idea of environmental protection whereby some scholars saw environment as something of its sake  the commission has thus reduced the number of people living on less than a dollar a day to just half of what it used to be as many can approach the environment and use it these achievements can also be attributed to economic growth in china and india  10   ex officio  in may 1984  an organizational meeting of the commission was held in geneva to adopt its rues of procedure and operation and to appoint a secretary general to guide its work  in july 1984  a secretariat was established in geneva  temporarily at the centre de morillon and later at the palais wilson  members of the secretariat have included  12   secretary general  jim macneill  senior professional staff  general services and support staff
