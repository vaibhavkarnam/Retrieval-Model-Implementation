Waterconservation
 water conservation includes all the policies  strategies and activities made to sustainably manage the natural resource fresh water  to protect the water environment  and to meet the current and future human demand  population  household size  and growth and affluence all affect how much water is used  factors such as climate change have increased pressures on natural water resources especially in manufacturing and agricultural irrigation  1  many us cities have already implemented policies aimed at water conservation  with much success  2   the goals of water conservation efforts include       the key activities that benefit water conservation are as follows xa0   one strategy in water conservation is rain water harvesting  6  digging ponds  lakes  canals  expanding the water reservoir  and installing rain water catching ducts and filtration systems on homes are different methods of harvesting rain water  6  harvested and filtered rain water could be used for toilets  home gardening  lawn irrigation  and small scale agriculture  6   another strategy in water conservation is protecting groundwater resources  when precipitation occurs  some infiltrates the soil and goes underground  7  water in this saturation zone is called groundwater  7  contamination of groundwater causes the groundwater water supply to not be able to be used as resource of fresh drinking water and the natural regeneration of contaminated groundwater can takes years to replenish  8  some examples of potential sources of groundwater contamination include storage tanks  septic systems  uncontrolled hazardous waste  landfills  atmospheric contaminants  chemicals  and road salts  8  contamination of groundwater decreases the replenishment of available freshwater so taking preventative measures by protecting groundwater resources form contamination is an important aspect of water conservation  6   an additional strategy to water conservation is practicing sustainable methods of utilizing groundwater resources  6  groundwater flows due to gravity and eventually discharges into streams  7  excess pumping of groundwater leads to a decrease in groundwater levels and if continued it can exhaust the resource  6  ground and surface waters are connected and overuse of groundwater can reduce and  in extreme examples  diminish the water supply of lakes  rivers  and streams  8  in coastal regions  over pumping groundwater can increase saltwater intrusion which results in the contamination of groundwater water supply  8  sustainable use of groundwater is essential in water conservation   a fundamental component to water conservation strategy is communication and education outreach of different water programs  9  developing communication that educates science to land managers  policy makers  farmers  and the general public is another important strategy utilized in water conservation  9  communication of the science of how water systems work is an important aspect when creating a management plan to conserve that system and is often used for ensuring the right management plan to be put into action  9   water conservation programs involved in social solutions are typically initiated at the local level  by either municipal water utilities or regional governments  common strategies include public outreach campaigns  10][11][12  tiered water rates  charging progressively higher prices as water use increases   or restrictions on outdoor water use such as lawn watering and car washing  13  cities in dry climates often require or encourage the installation of xeriscaping or natural landscaping in new homes to reduce outdoor water usage  14  most urban outdoor water use in california is residential  15  illustrating a reason for outreach to households as well as businesses   one fundamental conservation goal is universal metering  the prevalence of residential water metering varies significantly worldwide  recent studies have estimated that water supplies are metered in less than 30  of uk households  16  and about 61  of urban canadian homes  as of 2001).[17  although individual water meters have often been considered impractical in homes with private wells or in multifamily buildings  the u s  environmental protection agency estimates that metering alone can reduce consumption by 20 to 40 percent  18  in addition to raising consumer awareness of their water use  metering is also an important way to identify and localize water leakage  water metering would benefit society in the long run it is proven that water metering increases the efficiency of the entire water system  as well as help unnecessary expenses for individuals for years to come  one would be unable to waste water unless they are willing to pay the extra charges  this way the water department would be able to monitor water usage by public  domestic and manufacturing services   some researchers have suggested that water conservation efforts should be primarily directed at farmers  in light of the fact that crop irrigation accounts for 70  of the world s fresh water use  19  the agricultural sector of most countries is important both economically and politically  and water subsidies are common  conservation advocates have urged removal of all subsidies to force farmers to grow more water-efficient crops and adopt less wasteful irrigation techniques   new technology poses a few new options for consumers  features such and full flush and half flush when using a toilet are trying to make a difference in water consumption and waste  also available are modern shower heads that help reduce wasting water  old shower heads are said to use 5-10 gallons per minute  while new fixtures available are said to use 2.5 gallons per minute and offer equal water coverage   the home water works website contains useful information on household water conservation  20  contrary to popular view  experts suggest the most efficient way is replacing toilets and retrofitting washers  21   water-saving technology for the home includes   many water-saving devices  such as low-flush toilets  that are useful in homes can also be useful for business water saving  other water-saving technology for businesses includes   for crop irrigation  optimal water efficiency means minimizing losses due to evaporation  runoff or subsurface drainage while maximizing production  an evaporation pan in combination with specific crop correction factors can be used to determine how much water is needed to satisfy plant requirements  flood irrigation  the oldest and most common type  is often very uneven in distribution  as parts of a field may receive excess water in order to deliver sufficient quantities to other parts  overhead irrigation  using center-pivot or lateral-moving sprinklers  has the potential for a much more equal and controlled distribution pattern  drip irrigation is the most expensive and least-used type  but offers the ability to deliver water to plant roots with minimal losses  however  drip irrigation is increasingly affordable  especially for the home gardener and in light of rising water rates  using drip irrigation methods can save up to 30,000 gallons of water per year when replacing irrigation systems that spray in all directions  22  there are also cheap effective methods similar to drip irrigation such as the use of soaking hoses that can even be submerged in the growing medium to eliminate evaporation   as changing irrigation systems can be a costly undertaking  conservation efforts often concentrate on maximizing the efficiency of the existing system  this may include chiseling compacted soils  creating furrow dikes to prevent runoff  and using soil moisture and rainfall sensors to optimize irrigation schedules  18  usually large gains in efficiency are possible through measurement and more effective management of the existing irrigation system  the 2011 unep green economy report notes that   i mproved soil organic matter from the use of green manures  mulching  and recycling of crop residues and animal manure increases the water holding capacity of soils and their ability to absorb water during torrential rains   23  which is a way to optimize the use of rainfall and irrigation during dry periods in the season   water shortage has become an increasingly difficult problem to manage  more than 40  of the world s population live in a region where the demand for water exceeds its supply  the imbalance between supply and demand  along with persisting issues such as climate change and exponential population growth  has made water reuse a necessary method for conserving water  24  there are a variety of methods used in the treatment of waste water to ensure that it safe to use for irrigation of food crops and or drinking water   seawater desalination requires more energy than the desalination of fresh water  despite this  many seawater desalination plants have been built in response to water shortages around the world  this makes it necessary to evaluate the impacts of seawater desalination and to find ways to improve desalination technology  current research involves the use of experiments to determine the most effective and least energy intensive methods of desalination  25][26   sand filtration is another method used to treat water  recent studies show that sand filtration needs further improvements  but it is approaching optimization with its effectiveness at removing pathogens from water  27][28  sand filtration is very effective at removing protozoa and bacteria  but struggles with removing viruses  29  large-scale sand filtration facilities also require large surface areas to accommodate them   the removal of pathogens from recycled water is of high priority because wastewater always contains pathogens capable of infecting humans  the levels of pathogenic viruses have to be reduced to a certain level in order for recycled water to not pose a threat to human populations  further research is necessary to determine more accurate methods of assessing the level of pathogenic viruses in treated wastewater
