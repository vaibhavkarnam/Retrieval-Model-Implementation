Heatpumps
 a heat pump is a device that transfers heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a  heat sink   heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one  a heat pump uses a small amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink  1   while air conditioners and freezers are familiar examples of heat pumps  the term  heat pump  is more general and applies to many hvac  heating  ventilating  and air conditioning  devices used for space heating or space cooling  when a heat pump is used for heating  it employs the same basic refrigeration-type cycle used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator  but in the opposite direction - releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment  in this use  heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground  2   in heating mode  heat pumps are three to four times more effective at heating than simple electrical resistance heaters using the same amount of electricity  typically installed cost for a heat pump is about 20 times greater than for resistance heaters  3][4       heat energy naturally transfers from warmer places to colder spaces  however  a heat pump can reverse this by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one  heat is not conserved in this process and requires some amount of external energy such as electricity  in heating  ventilation and air conditioning  hvac  systems  the term heat pump usually refers to vapor-compression refrigeration devices optimized for high efficiency in both directions of thermal energy transfer  these heat pumps can be reversible  and work in either direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space   heat pumps are used to transfer heat because less high-grade energy is required than is released as heat  most of the energy for heating comes from the external environment  only a fraction of which comes from electricity  or some other high-grade energy source required to run a compressor   in electrically-powered heat pumps  the heat transferred can be three or four times larger than the electrical power consumed  giving the system a coefficient of performance  cop  of 3 or 4  as opposed to a cop of 1 for a conventional electrical resistance heater  in which all heat is produced from input electrical energy   heat pumps use a refrigerant as an intermediate fluid to absorb heat where it vaporizes  in the evaporator  and then to release heat where the refrigerant condenses  in the condenser  the refrigerant flows through insulated pipes between the evaporator and the condenser  allowing for efficient thermal energy transfer at relatively long distances  5   reversible heat pumps work in either direction to provide heating or cooling to the internal space  they employ a reversing valve to reverse the flow of refrigerant from the compressor through the condenser and evaporation coils   in heating mode  the outdoor coil is an evaporator  while the indoor is a condenser  the refrigerant flowing from the evaporator  outdoor coil  carries the thermal energy from outside air  or soil  indoors  vapor temperature is augmented within the pump by compressing it  the indoor coil then transfers thermal energy  including energy from the compression  to the indoor air  which is then moved around the inside of the building by an air handler   alternatively  thermal energy is transferred to water  which is then used to heat the building via radiators or underfloor heating  the heated water may also be used for domestic hot water consumption  the refrigerant is then allowed to expand  cool  and absorb heat from the outdoor temperature in the outside evaporator  and the cycle repeats  this is a standard refrigeration cycle  save that the  cold  side of the refrigerator  the evaporator coil  is positioned so it is outdoors where the environment is colder   in cold weather  the outdoor unit of an air source heat pump needs to be intermittently defrosted  this will cause the auxiliary or emergency heating elements  located in the air-handler  to be activated  at the same time  the frost on the outdoor coil will quickly be melted due to the warm refrigerant  the condenser evaporator fan will not run during defrost mode   in cooling mode the cycle is similar  but the outdoor coil is now the condenser and the indoor coil  which reaches a lower temperature  is the evaporator  this is the familiar mode in which air conditioners operate   milestones   mechanical heat pumps exploit the physical properties of a volatile evaporating and condensing fluid known as a refrigerant  the heat pump compresses the refrigerant to make it hotter on the side to be warmed  and releases the pressure at the side where heat is absorbed   the working fluid  in its gaseous state  is pressurized and circulated through the system by a compressor  on the discharge side of the compressor  the now hot and highly pressurized vapor is cooled in a heat exchanger  called a condenser  until it condenses into a high pressure  moderate temperature liquid  the condensed refrigerant then passes through a pressure-lowering device also called a metering device  this may be an expansion valve  capillary tube  or possibly a work-extracting device such as a turbine  the low-pressure liquid refrigerant then enters another heat exchanger  the evaporator  in which the fluid absorbs heat and boils  the refrigerant then returns to the compressor and the cycle is repeated  8   it is essential that the refrigerant reach a sufficiently high temperature  when compressed  to release heat through the  hot  heat exchanger  the condenser   similarly  the fluid must reach a sufficiently low temperature when allowed to expand  or else heat cannot flow from the ambient cold region into the fluid in the cold heat exchanger  the evaporator   in particular  the pressure difference must be great enough for the fluid to condense at the hot side and still evaporate in the lower pressure region at the cold side  the greater the temperature difference  the greater the required pressure difference  and consequently the more energy needed to compress the fluid  thus  as with all heat pumps  the coefficient of performance  amount of thermal energy moved per unit of input work required  decreases with increasing temperature difference   insulation is used to reduce the work and energy required to achieve a low enough temperature in the space to be cooled   heat is typically transferred through engineered heating or cooling systems by using a flowing gas or liquid  air is sometimes used  but quickly becomes impractical under many circumstances because it requires large ducts to transfer relatively small amounts of heat  in systems using refrigerant  this working fluid can also be used to transfer heat a considerable distance  though this can become impractical because of increased risk of expensive refrigerant leakage  when large amounts of heat are to be transferred  water is typically used  often supplemented with antifreeze  corrosion inhibitors  and other additives   a common source or sink for heat in smaller installations is the outside air  as used by an air-source heat pump  a fan is needed to improve heat exchange efficiency   larger installations handling more heat  or in tight physical spaces  often use water-source heat pumps  the heat is sourced or rejected in water flow  which can carry much larger amounts of heat through a given pipe or duct cross-section than air flow can carry  the water may be heated at a remote location by boilers  solar energy  or other means  alternatively when needed  the water may be cooled by using a cooling tower  or discharged into a large body of water  such as a lake  stream or an ocean   geothermal heat pumps or ground-source heat pumps use shallow underground heat exchangers as a heat source or sink  and water as the heat transfer medium  this is possible because below ground level  the temperature is relatively constant across the seasons  and the earth can provide or absorb a large amount of heat  ground source heat pumps work in the same way as air-source heat pumps  but exchange heat with the ground via water pumped through pipes in the ground  ground source heat pumps are more simple and therefore more reliable than air source heat pumps as they do not need fan or defrosting systems and can be housed inside  although a ground heat exchanger requires a higher initial capital cost  the annual running costs are lower  because well-designed ground source heat pump systems operate more efficiently because they start with a warmer source temperature than the air in winter   heat pump installations may be installed alongside an auxiliary conventional heat source such as electrical resistance heaters  or oil or gas combustion  the auxiliary source is installed to meet peak heating loads  or to provide a back-up system   there are millions of domestic installations using air source heat pumps  9  they are used in climates with moderate space heating and cooling needs  hvac  and may also provide domestic hot water  10  the purchase costs are supported in various countries by consumer rebates  11   in hvac applications  a heat pump is typically a vapor-compression refrigeration device that includes a reversing valve and optimized heat exchangers so that the direction of heat flow  thermal energy movement  may be reversed  the reversing valve switches the direction of refrigerant through the cycle and therefore the heat pump may deliver either heating or cooling to a building  in cooler climates  the default setting of the reversing valve is heating   the default setting in warmer climates is cooling  because of the two heat exchangers  the condenser and evaporator  must swap functions  they are optimized to perform adequately in both modes  therefore  the seer rating  which is the seasonal energy efficiency rating  of a reversible heat pump is typically slightly less than two separately optimized machines  for equipment to receive the energy star rating  it must have a rating of at least 14.5 seer  12   in water heating applications  a heat pump may be used to heat or preheat water for swimming pools or heating potable water for use by homes and industry  usually heat is extracted from outdoor air and transferred to an indoor water tank  another variety extracts heat from indoor air to assist in cooling the space   commissioned in 2011 this district heating extracts heat from a fjord whose temperature is around 8\xa0\xb0c using 3 systems giving a combined capacity of 14 megawatts to town center residences and businesses  a city ordinance mandates this heating system for many new buildings   until the 1990s  the refrigerants were often chlorofluorocarbons such as r-12  dichlorodifluoromethane   one in a class of several refrigerants using the brand name freon  a trademark of dupont  its manufacture is now banned or severely restricted by the montreal protocol of august 1987 because of the damage that cfcs cause to the ozone layer if released into the atmosphere  13   one widely adopted replacement refrigerant is the hydrofluorocarbon  hfc  known as r-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane   heat pumps using r-134a replaced r-12  dichlorodifluoromethane  and have similar thermodynamic properties but with insignificant ozone depletion potential and a somewhat lower global warming potential  14  other substances such as liquid r-717 ammonia are widely used in large-scale systems  or occasionally the less corrosive but more flammable propane or butane  can also be used  15   since 2001  carbon dioxide  r-744  has increasingly been used  utilizing the transcritical cycle  although it requires much higher working pressures  in residential and commercial applications  the hydrochlorofluorocarbon  hcfc  r-22 is still widely used  however  hfc r-410a does not deplete the ozone layer and is being used more frequently  however  it is a powerful greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change  16][17  hydrogen  helium  nitrogen  or plain air is used in the stirling cycle  providing the maximum number of options in environmentally friendly gases   more recent refrigerators use r600a which is isobutane  and does not deplete the ozone and is less harmful to the environment  18  dimethyl ether  dme  has also gained in popularity as a refrigerant  19   a ground source heat pump has no need for an outdoor unit with moving mechanical components  no external noise is produced  citation needed   an air source heat pump requires an outdoor unit containing moving mechanical components including fans which produce noise  in 2013  the cen started work on standards for protection from noise pollution caused by heat pump outdoor units  20  although the cen tc 113 business plan outset was that  consumers increasingly require a low acoustic power of these units as the users and their neighbours now reject noisy installations   no standards for noise barriers or other means of noise protection had been developed by january 2016   in the united states  the allowed nighttime noise level was defined in 1974 as  an average 24-hr exposure limit of 55 a-weighted decibels  dba  to protect the public from all adverse effects on health and welfare in residential areas  u s  epa 1974   this limit is a day u2013night 24-hr average noise level  ldn   with a 10-dba penalty applied to nighttime levels between 2200 and 0700 hours to account for sleep disruption and no penalty applied to daytime levels  21  the 10-db a  penalty makes the permitted u s  nighttime noise level equal to 45 db a   which is more than is accepted in some european countries but less than the noise produced by some heat pumps   another feature of ashp external heat exchangers is their need to stop the fan from time to time for a period of several minutes in order to get rid of frost 22  that accumulates in the outdoor unit in the heating mode  after that  the heat pump starts to work again  this part of the work cycle results in two sudden changes of the noise made by the fan  the acoustic effect of such disruption on neighbors is especially powerful in quiet environments where background nighttime noise may be as low as 0 to 10dba  this is included in legislation in france  according to the french concept of noise nuisance   noise emergence  is the difference between ambient noise including the disturbing noise  and ambient noise without the disturbing noise  23][24   when comparing the performance of heat pumps  it is best to avoid the word  efficiency   which has a very specific thermodynamic definition  the term coefficient of performance  cop  is used to describe the ratio of useful heat movement per work input  most vapor-compression heat pumps use electrically powered motors for their work input   according to the us epa  geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption up to 44  compared with air-source heat pumps and up to 72  compared with electric resistance heating  25  the cop for heat pumps range from 3.2 to 4.5 for air source heat pumps to 4.2 to 5.2 for ground source heat pumps  26   when used for heating a building with an outside temperature of  for example  10\xa0\xb0c  a typical air-source heat pump  ashp  has a cop of 3 to 4  whereas an electrical resistance heater has a cop of 1.0  that is  one joule of electrical energy will cause a resistance heater to produce only one joule of useful heat  while under ideal conditions  one joule of electrical energy can cause a heat pump to move three or four joules of heat from a cooler place to a warmer place  note that an air source heat pump is more efficient in hotter climates than cooler ones  so when the weather is much warmer the unit will perform with a higher cop  as it has a smaller temperature gap to bridge   when there is a wide temperature differential between the hot and cold reservoirs  the cop is lower  worse   in extreme cold weather the cop will go down to 1.0   on the other hand  well designed ground-source heat pump  gshp  systems benefit from the moderate temperature underground  as the ground acts naturally as a store of thermal energy  27  their year-round cop is therefore normally in the range of 3.2 to 5.0   when there is a high temperature differential  e g   when an air-source heat pump is used to heat a house with an outside temperature of  say  0\xa0\xb0c (32\xa0\xb0f    it takes more work to move the same amount of heat to indoors than on a milder day  ultimately  due to carnot efficiency limits  the heat pump s performance will decrease as the outdoor-to-indoor temperature difference increases  outside temperature gets colder   reaching a theoretical limit of 1.0 at \u2212273\xa0\xb0c  in practice  a cop of 1.0 will typically be reached at an outdoor temperature around \u221218\xa0\xb0c (0\xa0\xb0f  for air source heat pumps   also  as the heat pump takes heat out of the air  some moisture in the outdoor air may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger  the system must periodically melt this ice  this defrosting translates into an additional energy  electricity  expenditure  when it is extremely cold outside  it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source  such as an electric resistance heater  oil furnace  or gas furnace  rather than to run an air-source heat pump  also  avoiding the use of the heat pump during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machine s compressor   the design of the evaporator and condenser heat exchangers is also very important to the overall efficiency of the heat pump  the heat exchange surface areas and the corresponding temperature differential  between the refrigerant and the air stream  directly affect the operating pressures and hence the work the compressor has to do in order to provide the same heating or cooling effect  generally  the larger the heat exchanger  the lower the temperature differential and the more efficient the system becomes   heat exchangers are expensive  requiring drilling for some heat-pump types or large spaces to be efficient  and the heat pump industry generally competes on price rather than efficiency  heat pumps are already at a price disadvantage when it comes to initial investment  not long-term savings  compared to conventional heating solutions like boilers  so the drive towards more efficient heat pumps and air conditioners is often led by legislative measures on minimum efficiency standards  electricity rates will also influence the attractiveness of heat pumps  28   in cooling mode  a heat pump s operating performance is described in the us as its energy efficiency ratio  eer  or seasonal energy efficiency ratio  seer   and both measures have units of btu  h xb7w  (1 btu  h xb7w  xa0  0.293 w w   a larger eer number indicates better performance  the manufacturer s literature should provide both a cop to describe performance in heating mode  and an eer or seer to describe performance in cooling mode  actual performance varies  however  and depends on many factors such as installation details  temperature differences  site elevation  and maintenance   as with any piece of equipment that depends on coils to transfer heat between air and a fluid  it is important for both the condenser and evaporator coils to be kept clean  if deposits of dust and other debris are allowed to accumulate on the coils  the efficiency of the unit  both in heating and cooling modes  will suffer   heat pumps are more effective for heating than for cooling an interior space if the temperature differential is held equal  this is because the compressor s input energy is also converted to useful heat when in heating mode  and is discharged along with the transported heat via the condenser to the interior space  but for cooling  the condenser is normally outdoors  and the compressor s dissipated work  waste heat  must also be transported to outdoors using more input energy  rather than being put to a useful purpose  for the same reason  opening a food refrigerator or freezer has the net effect of heating up the room rather than cooling it  because its refrigeration cycle rejects heat to the indoor air  this heat includes the compressor s dissipated work as well as the heat removed from the inside of the appliance   the cop for a heat pump in a heating or cooling application  with steady-state operation  is   where  the cop increases as the temperature difference  or  lift   decreases between heat source and destination  the cop can be maximized at design time by choosing a heating system requiring only a low final water temperature  e g  underfloor heating   and by choosing a heat source with a high average temperature  e g  the ground   domestic hot water  dhw  and conventional heating radiators require high water temperatures  reducing the cop that can be attained  and affecting the choice of heat pump technology  citation needed   one observation is that while current  best practice  heat pumps  ground source system  operating between 0\xa0\xb0c and 35\xa0\xb0c  have a typical cop around 4  no better than 5  the maximum achievable is 8.8 because of fundamental carnot cycle limits  this means that in the coming decades  the energy efficiency of top-end heat pumps could roughly double  cranking up efficiency requires the development of a better gas compressor  fitting hvac machines with larger heat exchangers with slower gas flows  and solving internal lubrication problems resulting from slower gas flow   depending on the working fluid  the expansion stage can be important also  work done by the expanding fluid cools it and is available to replace some of the input power   an evaporating liquid is cooled by free expansion through a small hole  but an ideal gas is not    the two main types of heat pumps are compression and absorption  compression heat pumps operate on mechanical energy  typically driven by electricity   while absorption heat pumps may also run on heat as an energy source  from electricity or burnable fuels   32  an absorption heat pump may be fueled by natural gas or lp gas  for example  while the gas utilization efficiency in such a device  which is the ratio of the energy supplied to the energy consumed  may average only 1.5  that is better than a natural gas or lp gas furnace  which can only approach 1   by definition  all heat sources for a heat pump must be colder in temperature than the space to be heated  most commonly  heat pumps draw heat from the air  outside or inside air  or from the ground  groundwater or soil   33   the heat drawn from ground-sourced systems is in most cases stored solar heat  and it should not be confused with direct geothermal heating  though the latter will contribute in some small measure to all heat in the ground  true geothermal heat  when used for heating  requires a circulation pump but no heat pump  since for this technology the ground temperature is higher than that of the space that is to be heated  so the technology relies only upon simple heat convection   other heat sources for heat pumps include water  nearby streams and other natural water bodies have been used  and sometimes domestic waste water  via drain water heat recovery  which is often warmer than cold winter ambient temperatures  though still of lower temperature than the space to be heated    a number of sources have been used for the heat source for heating private and communal buildings  34   air-air heat pumps  that extract heat from outside air and transfer this heat to inside air  are the most common type of heat pumps and the cheapest  these are similar to air conditioners operating in reverse  air-water heat pumps are otherwise similar to air-air heat pumps  but they transfer the extracted heat into a water heating circuit  floor heating being the most efficient  and they can also transfer heat into a domestic hot water tank for use in showers and hot water taps of the building  however  ground-water heat pumps are more efficient than air-water heat pumps  and therefore they are often the better choice for providing heat for the floor heating and domestic hot water systems   air source heat pumps are relatively easy and inexpensive to install and have therefore historically been the most widely used heat pump type  however  they suffer limitations due to their use of the outside air as a heat source  the higher temperature differential during periods of extreme cold leads to declining efficiency  in mild weather  cop may be around 4.0  while at temperatures below around 0\xa0\xb0c (32\xa0\xb0f  an air-source heat pump may still achieve a cop of 2.5  the average cop over seasonal variation is typically 2.5-2.8  with exceptional models able to exceed this in mild climates   the heating output of low temperature optimized heat pumps  and hence their energy efficiency  still declines dramatically as the temperature drops  but the threshold at which the decline starts is lower than conventional pumps  as shown in the following table  temperatures are approximate and may vary by manufacturer and model    ground-source heat pumps  also called geothermal heat pumps  typically have higher efficiencies than air-source heat pumps  this is because they draw heat from the ground or groundwater which is at a relatively constant temperature all year round below a depth of about 30 feet (9 m   35  this means that the temperature differential is lower  leading to higher efficiency  well maintained ground-source heat pumps typically have cops of 4.0[36  at the beginning of the heating season  with lower seasonal cops of around 3.0 as heat is drawn from the ground  the tradeoff for this improved performance is that a ground-source heat pump is more expensive to install  due to the need for the drilling of boreholes for vertical placement of heat exchanger piping or the digging of trenches for horizontal placement of the piping that carries the heat exchange fluid  water with a little antifreeze    when compared  groundwater heat pumps are generally more efficient than heat pumps using heat from the soil  closed loop soil or ground heat exchangers tend to accumulate cold if the ground loop is undersized  this can be a significant problem if nearby ground water is stagnant or the soil lacks thermal conductivity  and the overall system has been designed to be just big enough to handle a  typical worst case  cold spell  or is simply undersized for the load  37  one way to fix cold accumulation in the ground heat exchanger loop  is to use ground water to cool the floors of the building on hot days  thereby transferring heat from the dwelling into the ground loop  there are several other methods for replenishing a low temperature ground loop  one way is to make large solar collectors  for instance by putting plastic pipes just under the roof  or by putting coils of black polyethylene pipes under glass on the roof  or by piping the tarmac of the parking lot  38  a further solution is to ensure ground collector arrays are correctly sized  by ensuring soil thermal properties and thermal conductivity are correctly measured and integrated into the design  39   hybrid  or twin source  heat pumps  when outdoor air is above 4 to 8 celsius  (40-50 fahrenheit  depending on ground water temperature  they use air  when air is colder  they use the ground source  these twin source systems can also store summer heat  by running ground source water through the air exchanger or through the building heater-exchanger  even when the heat pump itself is not running  this has dual advantage  it functions as a low running cost for air cooling  and  if ground water is relatively stagnant  it cranks up the temperature of the ground source  which improves the energy efficiency of the heat pump system by roughly 4  for each degree in temperature rise of the ground source   the air water-brine water heat pump is a hybrid heat pump  developed in rostock  germany  that uses only renewable energy sources  unlike other hybrid systems  which usually combine both conventional and renewable energy sources  it combines air and geothermal heat in one compact device  the air water-brine water heat pump has two evaporators \u2014 an outside air evaporator and a brine evaporator \u2014 both connected to the heat pump cycle  this allows use of the most economical heating source for the current external conditions  for example  air temperature   the unit automatically selects the most efficient operating mode \u2014 air or geothermal heat  or both together  the process is controlled by a control unit  which processes the large amounts of data delivered by the complex heating system   the control unit comprises two controllers  one for the air heat cycle and one for the geothermal circulation  in one device  all components communicate over a common bus to ensure they interact to enhance the efficiency of the hybrid heating system  the german patent and trade mark office in munich granted the air water-brine water heat pump a patent in 2008  under the title \u201cheat pump and method for controlling the source inlet temperature to the heat pump u201d  this hybrid heat pump can be combined with a solar thermal system or with an ice-storage  it trades and is marketed under the name thermselect  in the united kingdom  thermselect won the 2013 commercial heating product of the year award of the hvr awards for excellence  organised by heating and ventilating review  an industry magazine   a sahp is a machine that represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system  typically these two technologies are used separately  or only placing them in parallel  to produce hot water  40  in this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump s evaporator  41  the goal of this system is to get high cop and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way   in 1881  the german physicist emil warburg put a block of iron into a strong magnetic field and found that it increased very slightly in temperature  some commercial ventures to implement this technology are underway  claiming to cut energy consumption by 40  compared to current domestic refrigerators  42  the process works as follows  powdered gadolinium is moved into a magnetic field  heating the material by 2 to 5\xa0\xb0c (4 to 9\xa0\xb0f   the heat is removed by a circulating fluid  the material is then moved out of the magnetic field  reducing its temperature below its starting temperature  citation needed   solid state heat pumps using the thermoelectric effect have improved over time to the point where they are useful for certain refrigeration tasks  thermoelectric  peltier  heat pumps are generally only around 10-15  as efficient as the ideal refrigerator  carnot cycle   compared with 40\u201360  achieved by conventional compression cycle systems  reverse rankine systems using compression expansion   43  however  this area of technology is currently the subject of active research in materials science  a reason why this is popular is because it has a  long lifetime  as there are no moving parts and it does not use potentially hazardous refrigerants   near-solid-state heat pumps using thermoacoustics are commonly used in cryogenic laboratories  citation needed
