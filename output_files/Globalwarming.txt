Globalwarming
 global warming and climate change are terms for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the earth s climate system and its related effects  1][2  multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming  3][4][5  many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented over tens to thousands of years  6   in 2014  the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  fifth assessment report concluded that  it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century   [7  the largest human influence has been emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide  methane and nitrous oxide  human activities have led to carbon dioxide concentrations above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years  climate model projections summarized in the report indicated that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further 0.3 to 1.7\xa0\xb0c (0.5 to 3.1\xa0\xb0f  for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.6 to 4.8\xa0\xb0c (4.7 to 8.6\xa0\xb0f  for the highest emissions scenario  8  these findings have been recognized by the national science academies of the major industrialized nations 9  a  and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing  11   future climate change and associated impacts will differ from region to region around the globe  12][13  anticipated effects include warming global temperature  rising sea levels  changing precipitation  and expansion of deserts in the subtropics  14  warming is expected to be greater over land than over the oceans and greatest in the arctic  with the continuing retreat of glaciers  permafrost and sea ice  other likely changes include more frequent extreme weather events including heat waves  droughts  heavy rainfall with floods and heavy snowfall  15  ocean acidification  and species extinctions due to shifting temperature regimes  effects significant to humans include the threat to food security from decreasing crop yields and the abandonment of populated areas due to rising sea levels  16][17  because the climate system has a large  inertia  and greenhouse gases will stay in the atmosphere for a long time  many of these effects will not only exist for decades or centuries  but will persist for tens of thousands of years  18   possible societal responses to global warming include mitigation by emissions reduction  adaptation to its effects  building systems resilient to its effects  and possible future climate engineering  most countries are parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc   19  whose ultimate objective is to prevent dangerous anthropogenic climate change  20  parties to the unfccc have agreed that deep cuts in emissions are required 21  and that global warming should be limited to well below 2.0\xa0\xb0c (3.6\xa0\xb0f  relative to pre-industrial levels  b  with efforts made to limit warming to 1.5\xa0\xb0c (2.7\xa0\xb0f   23   public reactions to global warming and concern about its effects are also increasing  a global 2015 pew research center report showed a median of 54  consider it  a very serious problem   there are significant regional differences  with americans and chinese  whose economies are responsible for the greatest annual co2 emissions  among the least concerned  24       the global average  land and ocean  surface temperature shows a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06  \xb0c in the period 1880 to 2012  based on multiple independently produced datasets  26  earth s average surface temperature rose by 7002273890000000000\u26600.74\xb10.18\xa0\xb0c over the period 1906\u20132005  the rate of warming almost doubled for the last half of that period (7002273279999999999\u26600.13\xb10.03\xa0\xb0c xa0per decade  versus 7002273219999999999\u26600.07\xb10.02\xa0\xb0c xa0per decade   27  although the increase of near-surface atmospheric temperature is the measure of global warming often reported in the popular press  most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has gone into the oceans  the rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and atmosphere  28  c   the average temperature of the lower troposphere has increased between 0.12 and 0.135\xa0\xb0c (0.216 and 0.243\xa0\xb0f  xa0per xa0decade since 1979  according to satellite temperature measurements  29][30  climate proxies show the temperature to have been relatively stable over the one or two thousand years before 1850  with regionally varying fluctuations such as the medieval warm period and the little ice age  31   the warming that is evident in the instrumental temperature record is consistent with a wide range of observations  as documented by many independent scientific groups  32  examples include sea level rise  33  widespread melting of snow and land ice  34  increased heat content of the oceans  32  increased humidity  32  and the earlier timing of spring events  35  e g   the flowering of plants  36  the probability that these changes could have occurred by chance is virtually zero  32   temperature changes vary over the globe  since 1979  land temperatures have increased about twice as fast as ocean temperatures (7002273399999999999\u26600.25\xa0\xb0c xa0per decade against 7002273279999999999\u26600.13\xa0\xb0c xa0per decade   37  ocean temperatures increase more slowly than land temperatures because of the larger effective heat capacity of the oceans and because the ocean loses more heat by evaporation  38  since the beginning of industrialisation the temperature difference between the hemispheres has increased due to melting of sea ice and snow in the north  39  average arctic temperatures have been increasing at almost twice the rate of the rest of the world in the past 100 years  however arctic temperatures are also highly variable  40  although more greenhouse gases are emitted in the northern than southern hemisphere this does not contribute to the difference in warming because the major greenhouse gases persist long enough to mix between hemispheres  41   the thermal inertia of the oceans and slow responses of other indirect effects mean that climate can take centuries or longer to adjust to changes in forcing  one climate commitment study concluded that if greenhouse gases were stabilized at year 2000 levels  surface temperatures would still increase by about one-half degree celsius  42  and another found that if they were stabilized at 2005 levels surface warming could exceed a whole degree celsius  some of this surface warming will be driven by past natural forcings which are still seeking equilibrium in the climate system  one study using a highly simplified climate model indicates these past natural forcings may account for as much as 64  of the committed 2050 surface warming and their influence will fade with time compared to the human contribution  43   global temperature is subject to short-term fluctuations that overlay long-term trends and can temporarily mask them  the relative stability in surface temperature from 2002 to 2009  which has been dubbed the global warming hiatus by the media and some scientists  44  is consistent with such an episode  45][46  2015 updates to account for differing methods of measuring ocean surface temperature measurements show a positive trend over the recent decade  47][48   sixteen of the 17 warmest years on record have occurred since 2000.[49  while record-breaking years attract considerable public interest  individual years are less significant than the overall trend  some climatologists have criticized the attention that the popular press gives to  warmest year  statistics  in particular  ocean oscillations such as the el ni xf1o southern oscillation  enso  can cause temperatures of a given year to be abnormally warm or cold for reasons unrelated to the overall trend of climate change  gavin schmidt stated  the long-term trends or the expected sequence of records are far more important than whether any single year is a record or not   50   the climate system can spontaneously generate changes in global temperature for years to decades at a time but long-term changes in global temperature require external forcings  51][52][53  these forcings are  external  to the climate system but not necessarily external to earth  54  examples of external forcings include changes in atmospheric composition  e g   increased concentrations of greenhouse gases   solar luminosity  volcanic eruptions  and variations in earth s orbit around the sun  55   the greenhouse effect is the process by which absorption and emission of infrared radiation by gases in a planet s atmosphere warm its lower atmosphere and surface  it was proposed by joseph fourier in 1824  discovered in 1860 by john tyndall  56  was first investigated quantitatively by svante arrhenius in 1896,[57  and its scientific description was developed in the 1930s through 1960s by guy stewart callendar  58][59   on earth  an atmosphere containing naturally occurring amounts of greenhouse gases causes air temperature near the surface to be about 33\xa0\xb0c (59\xa0\xb0f  warmer than it would be in their absence  60  d  without the earth s atmosphere  the earth s average temperature would be well below the freezing temperature of water  61  the major greenhouse gases are water vapour  which causes about 36\u201370  of the greenhouse effect  carbon dioxide (co2   which causes 9\u201326   methane (ch4   which causes 4\u20139   and ozone (o3   which causes 3\u20137%.[62][63][64  clouds also affect the radiation balance through cloud forcings similar to greenhouse gases   human activity since the industrial revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  leading to increased radiative forcing from co2  methane  tropospheric ozone  cfcs and nitrous oxide  according to work published in 2007  the concentrations of co2 and methane had increased by 36  and 148  respectively since 1750.[65  these levels are much higher than at any time during the last 800,000 years  the period for which reliable data has been extracted from ice cores  66][67][68][69  less direct geological evidence indicates that co2 values higher than this were last seen about 20 million years ago  70   fossil fuel burning has produced about three-quarters of the increase in co2 from human activity over the past 20 years  the rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land-use  particularly deforestation  71  another significant non-fuel source of anthropogenic co2 emissions is the calcination of limestone for clinker production  a chemical process which releases co2.[72  estimates of global co2 emissions in 2011 from fossil fuel combustion  including cement production and gas flaring  was 34.8 billion tonnes (9.5 \xb1 0.5 pgc   an increase of 54  above emissions in 1990  coal burning was responsible for 43  of the total emissions  oil 34   gas 18   cement 4.9  and gas flaring 0.7%[73   in may 2013  it was reported that readings for co2 taken at the world s primary benchmark site in mauna loa surpassed 400 ppm  according to professor brian hoskins  this is likely the first time co2 levels have been this high for about 4.5 million years  74][75  monthly global co2 concentrations exceeded 400 ppm in march 2015  probably for the first time in several million years  76  on 12 november 2015  nasa scientists reported that human-made carbon dioxide continues to increase above levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years  currently  about half of the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels is not absorbed by vegetation and the oceans and remains in the atmosphere  77   over the last three decades of the twentieth century  gross domestic product per capita and population growth were the main drivers of increases in greenhouse gas emissions  78  co2 emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change  79][80]:71 emissions can be attributed to different regions  attributions of emissions due to land-use change are subject to considerable uncertainty  81][82]:289  emissions scenarios  estimates of changes in future emission levels of greenhouse gases  have been projected that depend upon uncertain economic  sociological  technological  and natural developments  83  in most scenarios  emissions continue to rise over the century  while in a few  emissions are reduced  84][85  fossil fuel reserves are abundant  and will not limit carbon emissions in the 21st century  86  emission scenarios  combined with modelling of the carbon cycle  have been used to produce estimates of how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future  using the six ipcc sres  marker  scenarios  models suggest that by the year 2100  the atmospheric concentration of co2 could range between 541 and 970 ppm  87  this is 90\u2013250  above the concentration in the year 1750   the popular media and the public often confuse global warming with ozone depletion  i e   the destruction of stratospheric ozone  e g   the ozone layer  by chlorofluorocarbons  88][89  although there are a few areas of linkage  the relationship between the two is not strong  reduced stratospheric ozone has had a slight cooling influence on surface temperatures  while increased tropospheric ozone has had a somewhat larger warming effect  90   global dimming  a gradual reduction in the amount of global direct irradiance at the earth s surface  was observed from 1961 until at least 1990.[91  solid and liquid particles known as aerosols  produced by volcanoes and human-made pollutants  are thought to be the main cause of this dimming  they exert a cooling effect by increasing the reflection of incoming sunlight  the effects of the products of fossil fuel combustion xa0\u2013 co2 and aerosols xa0\u2013 have partially offset one another in recent decades  so that net warming has been due to the increase in non-co2 greenhouse gases such as methane  92  radiative forcing due to aerosols is temporally limited due to the processes that remove aerosols from the atmosphere  removal by clouds and precipitation gives tropospheric aerosols an atmospheric lifetime of only about a week  while stratospheric aerosols can remain for a few years  carbon dioxide has a lifetime of a century or more  and as such  changes in aerosols will only delay climate changes due to carbon dioxide  93  black carbon is second only to carbon dioxide for its contribution to global warming  94   in addition to their direct effect by scattering and absorbing solar radiation  aerosols have indirect effects on the earth s radiation budget  sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets  these clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets  a phenomenon known as the twomey effect  95  this effect also causes droplets to be of more uniform size  which reduces growth of raindrops and makes the cloud more reflective to incoming sunlight  known as the albrecht effect  96  indirect effects are most noticeable in marine stratiform clouds  and have very little radiative effect on convective clouds  indirect effects of aerosols represent the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing  97   soot may either cool or warm earth s climate system  depending on whether it is airborne or deposited  atmospheric soot directly absorbs solar radiation  which heats the atmosphere and cools the surface  in isolated areas with high soot production  such as rural india  as much as 50  of surface warming due to greenhouse gases may be masked by atmospheric brown clouds  98  when deposited  especially on glaciers or on ice in arctic regions  the lower surface albedo can also directly heat the surface  99  the influences of atmospheric particles  including black carbon  are most pronounced in the tropics and sub-tropics  particularly in asia  while the effects of greenhouse gases are dominant in the extratropics and southern hemisphere  100   since 1978  solar irradiance has been measured by satellites  103  these measurements indicate that the sun s radiative output has not increased during that time  so the warming during the past 40 years cannot be attributed to an increase in solar energy reaching the earth   climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change  104  models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when they only take into account variations in solar output and volcanic activity  models are  however  able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings  including human influences and natural forcings   another line of evidence is differing temperature changes at different levels in the earth s atmosphere  105  basic physical principles require that the greenhouse effect produces warming of the lower atmosphere  the troposphere  but cooling of the upper atmosphere  the stratosphere   106][107  depletion of the ozone layer by chemical refrigerants has also resulted in a strong cooling effect in the stratosphere  if solar variations were responsible for observed warming  warming of both the troposphere and stratosphere would be expected  108   the tilt of the earth u2019s axis and the shape of its orbit around the sun vary slowly over tens of thousands of years  this changes climate by changing the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of incoming solar energy at earth s surface  109  during the last few thousand years  this phenomenon contributed to a slow cooling trend at high latitudes of the northern hemisphere during summer  a trend that was reversed by greenhouse-gas-induced warming during the 20th century  110][111][112][113  orbital cycles favorable for glaciation are not expected within the next 50,000 years  114][115   the climate system includes a range of feedbacks  which alter the response of the system to changes in external forcings  positive feedbacks increase the response of the climate system to an initial forcing  while negative feedbacks reduce it  116   there are a range of feedbacks in the climate system  including water vapour  changes in ice-albedo  snow and ice cover affect how much the earth s surface absorbs or reflects incoming sunlight   clouds  and changes in the earth s carbon cycle  e g   the release of carbon from soil   117  the main negative feedback is the energy the earth s surface radiates into space as infrared radiation  118  according to the stefan-boltzmann law  if the absolute temperature  as measured in kelvins  doubles  e  radiated energy increases by a factor of 16 (2 to the 4th power   119   feedbacks are an important factor in determining the sensitivity of the climate system to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations  other factors being equal  a higher climate sensitivity means that more warming will occur for a given increase in greenhouse gas forcing  120  uncertainty over the effect of feedbacks is a major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given forcing scenario  more research is needed to understand the role of clouds 116  and carbon cycle feedbacks in climate projections  121   the ipcc projections previously mentioned span the  likely  range  greater than 66  probability  based on expert judgement  122  for the selected emissions scenarios  however  the ipcc s projections do not reflect the full range of uncertainty  123  the lower end of the  likely  range appears to be better constrained than the upper end  123   a climate model is a representation of the physical  chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system  126  such models are based on scientific disciplines such as fluid dynamics and thermodynamics as well as physical processes such as radiative transfer  the models may be used to predict a range of variables such as local air movement  temperature  clouds  and other atmospheric properties  ocean temperature  salt content  and circulation  ice cover on land and sea  the transfer of heat and moisture from soil and vegetation to the atmosphere  and chemical and biological processes  among others   although researchers attempt to include as many processes as possible  simplifications of the actual climate system are inevitable because of the constraints of available computer power and limitations in knowledge of the climate system  results from models can also vary due to different greenhouse gas inputs and the model s climate sensitivity  for example  the uncertainty in ipcc s 2007 projections is caused by (1  the use of multiple models 123  with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations  127  (2  the use of differing estimates of humanity s future greenhouse gas emissions  123  (3  any additional emissions from climate feedbacks that were not included in the models ipcc used to prepare its report  i e   greenhouse gas releases from permafrost  128   the models do not assume the climate will warm due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases  instead the models predict how greenhouse gases will interact with radiative transfer and other physical processes  warming or cooling is thus a result  not an assumption  of the models  129   clouds and their effects are especially difficult to predict  improving the models  representation of clouds is therefore an important topic in current research  130  another prominent research topic is expanding and improving representations of the carbon cycle  131][132][133   models are also used to help investigate the causes of recent climate change by comparing the observed changes to those that the models project from various natural and human causes  although these models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects  they do indicate that the warming since 1970 is dominated by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions  55   the physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates  134  climate models produce a good match to observations of global temperature changes over the last century  but do not simulate all aspects of climate  135  not all effects of global warming are accurately predicted by the climate models used by the ipcc  observed arctic shrinkage has been faster than that predicted  136  precipitation increased proportionally to atmospheric humidity  and hence significantly faster than global climate models predict  137][138  since 1990  sea level has also risen considerably faster than models predicted it would  139   anthropogenic forcing has likely contributed to some of the observed changes  including sea level rise  changes in climate extremes  such as the number of warm and cold days   declines in arctic sea ice extent  glacier retreat  and greening of the sahara  142][143   during the 21st century  glaciers 144  and snow cover 145  are projected to continue their widespread retreat  projections of declines in arctic sea ice vary  146][147  recent projections suggest that arctic summers could be ice-free  defined as ice extent less than 1 million square km  as early as 2025-2030.[148    detection  is the process of demonstrating that climate has changed in some defined statistical sense  without providing a reason for that change  detection does not imply attribution of the detected change to a particular cause   attribution  of causes of climate change is the process of establishing the most likely causes for the detected change with some defined level of confidence  149  detection and attribution may also be applied to observed changes in physical  ecological and social systems  150   changes in regional climate are expected to include greater warming over land  with most warming at high northern latitudes  and least warming over the southern ocean and parts of the north atlantic ocean  151   future changes in precipitation are expected to follow existing trends  with reduced precipitation over subtropical land areas  and increased precipitation at subpolar latitudes and some equatorial regions  152  projections suggest a probable increase in the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events  such as heat waves  153   a 2015 study published in nature climate change  states   data analysis of extreme events from 1960 till 2010 suggests that droughts and heat waves appear simultaneously with increased frequency  156  extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased since 1980.[157   the sea level rise since 1993 has been estimated to have been on average 2.6\xa0mm and 2.9\xa0mm per year \xb1 0.4\xa0mm  additionally  sea level rise has accelerated from 1995 to 2015.[158  over the 21st century  the ipcc projects for a high emissions scenario  that global mean sea level could rise by 52\u201398\xa0cm  159  the ipcc s projections are conservative  and may underestimate future sea level rise  160  other estimates suggest that for the same period  global mean sea level could rise by 0.2 to 2.0 m (0.7\u20136.6\xa0ft   relative to mean sea level in 1992.[140   widespread coastal flooding would be expected if several degrees of warming is sustained for millennia  161  for example  sustained global warming of more than 2\xa0\xb0c  relative to pre-industrial levels  could lead to eventual sea level rise of around 1 to 4 m due to thermal expansion of sea water and the melting of glaciers and small ice caps  161  melting of the greenland ice sheet could contribute an additional 4 to 7.5\xa0m over many thousands of years  161  it has been estimated that we are already committed to a sea-level rise of approximately 2.3 metres for each degree of temperature rise within the next 2,000 years  162   warming beyond the 2\xa0\xb0c target would potentially lead to rates of sea-level rise dominated by ice loss from antarctica  continued co2 emissions from fossil sources could cause additional tens of metres of sea level rise  over the next millennia and eventually ultimately eliminate the entire antarctic ice sheet  causing about 58 metres of sea level rise  163   in terrestrial ecosystems  the earlier timing of spring events  as well as poleward and upward shifts in plant and animal ranges  have been linked with high confidence to recent warming  164  future climate change is expected to affect particular ecosystems  including tundra  mangroves  coral reefs   151  and caves  165  it is expected that most ecosystems will be affected by higher atmospheric co2 levels  combined with higher global temperatures  166  overall  it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species and reduced diversity of ecosystems  167   increases in atmospheric co2 concentrations have led to an increase in ocean acidity  168  dissolved co2 increases ocean acidity  measured by lower ph values  168  between 1750 and 2000  surface-ocean ph has decreased by \u22480.1  from \u22488.2 to \u22488.1.[169  surface-ocean ph has probably not been below \u22488.1 during the past 2 million years  169  projections suggest that surface-ocean ph could decrease by an additional 0.3\u20130.4 units by 2100.[170  future ocean acidification could threaten coral reefs  fisheries  protected species  and other natural resources of value to society  168][171   ocean deoxygenation is projected to increase hypoxia by 10   and triple suboxic waters  oxygen concentrations 98  less than the mean surface concentrations   for each 1\xa0\xb0c of upper ocean warming  172   on the timescale of centuries to millennia  the magnitude of global warming will be determined primarily by anthropogenic co2 emissions  173  this is due to carbon dioxide s very long lifetime in the atmosphere  173   stabilizing the global average temperature would require large reductions in co2 emissions  173  as well as reductions in emissions of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide  173][174  emissions of co2 would need to be reduced by more than 80  relative to their peak level  173  even if this were achieved  global average temperatures would remain close to their highest level for many centuries  173  as of 2016  emissions of co2 from burning fossil fuels had stopped increasing  but the guardian reports they need to be  reduced to have a real impact on climate change   meanwhile  this greenhouse gas continues to accumulate in the atmosphere  175  also  co2 is not the only factor driving climate change  concentrations of atmospheric methane  another greenhouse gas  rose dramatically between 2006-2016 for unknown reasons  this undermines efforts to combat global warming and there is a risk of an uncontrollable runaway greenhouse effect  176   long-term effects also include a response from the earth s crust  due to ice melting and deglaciation  in a process called post-glacial rebound  when land masses are no longer depressed by the weight of ice  this could lead to landslides and increased seismic and volcanic activities  tsunamis could be generated by submarine landslides caused by warmer ocean water thawing ocean-floor permafrost or releasing gas hydrates  177  some world regions  such as the french alps  already show signs of an increase in landslide frequency  178   climate change could result in global  large-scale changes in natural and social systems  179  examples include the possibility for the atlantic meridional overturning circulation to slow- or shutdown  which in the instance of a shutdown would change weather in europe and north america considerably  ocean acidification caused by increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide  and the long-term melting of ice sheets  which contributes to sea level rise  180   some large-scale changes could occur abruptly  i e   over a short time period  and might also be irreversible  examples of abrupt climate change are the rapid release of methane and carbon dioxide from permafrost  which would lead to amplified global warming  or the shutdown of thermohaline circulation  181][182  scientific understanding of abrupt climate change is generally poor  183  the probability of abrupt change for some climate related feedbacks may be low  181][184  factors that may increase the probability of abrupt climate change include higher magnitudes of global warming  warming that occurs more rapidly  and warming that is sustained over longer time periods  184   the effects of climate change on human systems  mostly due to warming or shifts in precipitation patterns  or both  have been detected worldwide  production of wheat and maize globally has been impacted by climate change  while crop production has increased in some mid-latitude regions such as the uk and northeast china  economic losses due to extreme weather events have increased globally  there has been a shift from cold- to heat-related mortality in some regions as a result of warming  livelihoods of indigenous peoples of the arctic have been altered by climate change  and there is emerging evidence of climate change impacts on livelihoods of indigenous peoples in other regions  regional impacts of climate change are now observable at more locations than before  on all continents and across ocean regions  185   the future social impacts of climate change will be uneven  186  many risks are expected to increase with higher magnitudes of global warming  187  all regions are at risk of experiencing negative impacts  188  low-latitude  less developed areas face the greatest risk  189  a study from 2015 concluded that economic growth  gross domestic product  of poorer countries is much more impaired with projected future climate warming  than previously thought  190   a meta-analysis of 56 studies concluded in 2014 that each degree of temperature rise will increase violence by up to 20   which includes fist fights  violent crimes  civil unrest or wars  191   examples of impacts include   in small islands and mega deltas  inundation as a result of sea level rise is expected to threaten vital infrastructure and human settlements  199][200  this could lead to issues of homelessness in countries with low-lying areas such as bangladesh  as well as statelessness for populations in countries such as the maldives and tuvalu  201   estimates based on the ipcc a1b emission scenario from additional co2 and ch4 greenhouse gases released from permafrost  estimate associated impact damages by us 43 trillion  202   continued permafrost degradation will likely result in unstable infrastructure in arctic regions  or alaska before 2100  thus  impacting roads  pipelines and buildings  as well as water distribution  and cause slope failures  203   mitigation of climate change are actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  or enhance the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb ghgs from the atmosphere  205  there is a large potential for future reductions in emissions by a combination of activities  including  energy conservation and increased energy efficiency  the use of low-carbon energy technologies  such as renewable energy  nuclear energy  and carbon capture and storage  206][207  and enhancing carbon sinks through  for example

long-term trends in the global energy system are inconsistent with limiting global warming at below 1.5 or 2\xa0\xb0c  relative to pre-industrial levels  209][210  pledges made as part of the canc xfan agreements are broadly consistent with having a likely chance (66 to 100  probability  of limiting global warming  in the 21st century  at below 3\xa0\xb0c  relative to pre-industrial levels  210   in limiting warming at below 2\xa0\xb0c  more stringent emission reductions in the near-term would allow for less rapid reductions after 2030.[211  many integrated models are unable to meet the 2\xa0\xb0c target if pessimistic assumptions are made about the availability of mitigation technologies  212   other policy responses include adaptation to climate change  adaptation to climate change may be planned  either in reaction to or anticipation of climate change  or spontaneous  i e   without government intervention  213  planned adaptation is already occurring on a limited basis  206  the barriers  limits  and costs of future adaptation are not fully understood  206   a concept related to adaptation is adaptive capacity  which is the ability of a system  human  natural or managed  to adjust to climate change  including climate variability and extremes  to moderate potential damages  to take advantage of opportunities  or to cope with consequences  214  unmitigated climate change  i e   future climate change without efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions  would  in the long term  be likely to exceed the capacity of natural  managed and human systems to adapt  215   environmental organizations and public figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail  while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions  216   climate engineering  sometimes called geoengineering or climate intervention  is the deliberate modification of the climate  it has been investigated as a possible response to global warming  e g  by nasa 217  and the royal society  218  techniques under research fall generally into the categories solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal  although various other schemes have been suggested  a study from 2014 investigated the most common climate engineering methods and concluded they are either ineffective or have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change  219   most countries in the world are parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc   222  the ultimate objective of the convention is to prevent dangerous human interference of the climate system  223  as stated in the convention  this requires that ghg concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change  food production is not threatened  and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion  224  the framework convention was agreed in 1992  but since then  global emissions have risen  225   during negotiations  the g77  a lobbying group in the united nations representing 133 developing nations  226]:4 pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to   take  the lead  in reducing their emissions  227  this was justified on the basis that  the developed world s emissions had contributed most to the cumulation of ghgs in the atmosphere  per-capita emissions  i e   emissions per head of population  were still relatively low in developing countries  and the emissions of developing countries would grow to meet their development needs  82]:290  this mandate was sustained in the kyoto protocol to the framework convention  82]:290 which entered into legal effect in 2005.[228  in ratifying the kyoto protocol  most developed countries accepted legally binding commitments to limit their emissions  these first-round commitments expired in 2012.[228  united states president george w  bush rejected the treaty on the basis that  it exempts 80  of the world  including major population centres such as china and india  from compliance  and would cause serious harm to the us economy   226]:5  at the 15th unfccc conference of the parties  held in 2009 at copenhagen  several unfccc parties produced the copenhagen accord  229][230  parties associated with the accord (140 countries  as of november 2010)[231]:9 aim to limit the future increase in global mean temperature to below 7002275149999999999\u26602\xa0\xb0c  232  the 16th conference of the parties (cop16  was held at canc xfan in 2010  it produced an agreement  not a binding treaty  that the parties should take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to meet a goal of limiting global warming to 7002275149999999999\u26602\xa0\xb0c above pre-industrial temperatures  it also recognized the need to consider strengthening the goal to a global average rise of 7002274649999999999\u26601.5\xa0\xb0c  233   there is continuing discussion through published peer-reviewed scientific papers  which are assessed by scientists working in the relevant fields taking part in the intergovernmental panel on climate change  the scientific consensus as of 2013 stated in the ipcc fifth assessment report is that it  is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century   234  a 2008 report by the u s  national academy of sciences stated that most scientists by then agreed that observed warming in recent decades was primarily caused by human activities increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere  79  in 2005 the royal society stated that while the overwhelming majority of scientists were in agreement on the main points  some individuals and organizations opposed to the consensus on urgent action needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have tried to undermine the science and work of the ipcc  235  national science academies have called on world leaders for policies to cut global emissions  236   in the scientific literature  there is a strong consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases  237  no scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view  11][238   the global warming controversy refers to a variety of disputes  substantially more pronounced in the popular media than in the scientific literature  239][240  regarding the nature  causes  and consequences of global warming  the disputed issues include the causes of increased global average air temperature  especially since the mid-20th century  whether this warming trend is unprecedented or within normal climatic variations  whether humankind has contributed significantly to it  and whether the increase is completely or partially an artefact of poor measurements  additional disputes concern estimates of climate sensitivity  predictions of additional warming  and what the consequences of global warming will be   by 1990  american conservative think tanks had begun challenging the legitimacy of global warming as a social problem  they challenged the scientific evidence  argued that global warming will have benefits  and asserted that proposed solutions would do more harm than good  241  some people dispute aspects of climate change science  235][242  organizations such as the libertarian competitive enterprise institute  conservative commentators  and some companies such as exxonmobil have challenged ipcc climate change scenarios  funded scientists who disagree with the scientific consensus  and provided their own projections of the economic cost of stricter controls  243][244][245][246  on the other hand  some fossil fuel companies have scaled back their efforts in recent years  247  or even called for policies to reduce global warming  248  global oil companies have begun to acknowledge climate change exists and is caused by human activities and the burning of fossil fuels  249   the world public  or at least people in economically advanced regions  became broadly aware of the global warming problem in the late 1980s  polling groups began to track opinions on the subject  at first mainly in the united states  250  the longest consistent polling  by gallup in the us  found relatively small deviations of 10  or so from 1998 to 2015 in opinion on the seriousness of global warming  but with increasing polarization between those concerned and those unconcerned  251   the first major worldwide poll  conducted by gallup in 2008-2009 in 127 countries  found that some 62  of people worldwide said they knew about global warming  in the advanced countries of north america  europe and japan  90  or more knew about it (97  in the u s   99  in japan   in less developed countries  especially in africa  fewer than a quarter knew about it  although many had noticed local weather changes  among those who knew about global warming  there was a wide variation between nations in belief that the warming was a result of human activities  252   by 2010  with 111 countries surveyed  gallup determined that there was a substantial decrease since 2007\u201308 in the number of americans and europeans who viewed global warming as a serious threat  in the us  just a little over half the population (53   now viewed it as a serious concern for either themselves or their families  this was 10 points below the 2008 poll (63    latin america had the biggest rise in concern  73  said global warming is a serious threat to their families  253  this global poll also found that people are more likely to attribute global warming to human activities than to natural causes  except in the us where nearly half (47   of the population attributed global warming to natural causes  254   a march u2013may 2013 survey by pew research center for the people  amp  the press polled 39 countries about global threats  according to 54  of those questioned  global warming featured top of the perceived global threats  255  in a january 2013 survey  pew found that 69  of americans say there is solid evidence that the earth s average temperature has gotten warmer over the past few decades  up six points since november 2011 and 12 points since 2009.[256   a 2010 survey of 14 industrialized countries found that skepticism about the danger of global warming was highest in australia  norway  new zealand and the united states  in that order  correlating positively with per capita emissions of carbon dioxide  257   in the 1950s  research suggested increasing temperatures  and a 1952 newspaper reported  climate change   this phrase next appeared in a november 1957 report in the hammond times which described roger revelle s research into the effects of increasing human-caused co2 emissions on the greenhouse effect   a large scale global warming  with radical climate changes may result   both phrases were only used occasionally until 1975  when wallace smith broecker published a scientific paper on the topic   climatic change  are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming   the phrase began to come into common use  and in 1976 mikhail budyko s statement that  a global warming up has started  was widely reported  258  other studies  such as a 1971 mit report  referred to the human impact as  inadvertent climate modification   but an influential 1979 national academy of sciences study headed by jule charney followed broecker in using global warming for rising surface temperatures  while describing the wider effects of increased co2 as climate change  259   in 1986 and november 1987  nasa climate scientist james hansen gave testimony to congress on global warming  there were increasing heatwaves and drought problems in the summer of 1988  and when hansen testified in the senate on 23 june he sparked worldwide interest  260  he said   global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and the observed warming   261  public attention increased over the summer  and global warming became the dominant popular term  commonly used both by the press and in public discourse  259   in a 2008 nasa article on usage  erik m  conway defined global warming as  the increase in earth u2019s average surface temperature due to rising levels of greenhouse gases   while climate change was  a long-term change in the earth u2019s climate  or of a region on earth   as effects such as changing patterns of rainfall and rising sea levels would probably have more impact than temperatures alone  he considered global climate change a more scientifically accurate term  and like the intergovernmental panel on climate change  the nasa website would emphasize this wider context  259
