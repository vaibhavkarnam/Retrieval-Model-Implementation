PowertoX
 power-to-x  also p2x and p2y  has two meanings  first  power-to-x refers to a number of electricity conversion  energy storage  and reconversion pathways that utilize surplus electric power  typically during periods where fluctuating renewable energy generation exceeds load  1][2  second  power-to-x refers to conversion technologies that allow for the decoupling of power from the electricity sector for use in other sectors  such as transport or chemicals   possibly using power that has been provided by additional investments in generation  1  the term power-to-x is widely used in germany and may have originated there   the x in the terminology can refer to one of the following  power-to-ammonia  power-to-chemicals  power-to-fuel  power-to-gas  power-to-heat  power-to-hydrogen  power-to-liquid  power-to-methane  power-to-mobility  power-to-power  and power-to-syngas   collectively power-to-x schemes which use surplus power fall under the heading of flexibility measures and are particularly useful in energy systems with high shares of renewable generation and or with strong decarbonization targets  1][2  a large number of pathways and technologies are encompassed by the term  in 2016 the german government funded a \u20ac30\xa0million first-phase research project into power-to-x options  3       surplus electric power can be converted to other forms of energy for storage and reconversion  4][5][6][7  direct current electrolysis  efficiency 80\u201385  at best  can be used to produce hydrogen which can  in turn  be converted to methane (ch4  via methanation  4][8  these fuels can be stored and used to produce electricity again  hours to months later  reconversion technologies include gas turbines  ccgt plant  and fuel cells  power-to-power refers to the round-trip reconversion efficiency  4  for hydrogen storage  the round-trip efficiency remains limited at 35\u201350%.[2  electrolysis is expensive and power-to-gas processes need substantial full-load hours  say 30   to be economic  1  grid-dedicated battery storage is not normally considered a power-to-x concept   hydrogen and methane can also be used as downstream fuels  feed into the natural gas grid  or used to make or synthetic fuel  9][10  alternatively they can be used as a chemical feedstock  as can ammonia (nh3    power-to-heat involves contributing to the heat sector  either by resistance heating or via a heat pump  resistance heaters have unity efficiency  and the corresponding coefficient of performance  cop  of heat pumps is 2\u20135.[4  back-up immersion heating of both domestic hot water and district heating offers a cheap way of using surplus renewable energy and will often displace carbon-intensive fossil fuels for the task  1  large-scale heat pumps in district heating systems with thermal energy storage are an especially attractive option for power-to-heat  they offer exceptionally high efficiency for balancing excess wind and solar power  and they can be profitable investments  11][12   power-to-mobility refers to the charging of battery electric vehicles  ev   given the expected uptake of evs  dedicated dispatch will be required  as vehicles are idle for most of the time  shifting the charging time can offer considerable flexibility  the charging window is a relatively long 8\u201312\xa0hours  whereas the charging duration is around 90\xa0minutes  2  the ev batteries can also be discharged to the grid to make them work as electricity storage devices  but this causes additional wear to the battery  2   heat pumps with hot water storage and electric vehicles have been found to have higher potential on reduction of co2 emissions and fossil fuel use than several other power-to-x or electricity storage schemes for using surplus wind and solar power  4
