Geothermal
 geothermal gradient is the rate of increasing temperature with respect to increasing depth in the earth s interior  away from tectonic plate boundaries  it is about 25\xa0\xb0c per km of depth (1\xa0\xb0f per 70 feet of depth  near the surface in most of the world  1  strictly speaking  geo-thermal necessarily refers to the earth but the concept may be applied to other planets  a line tracing the gradient through the planetary body is called a geotherm on earth and other terrestrial planets  on the moon it is called a selenotherm   the earth s internal heat comes from a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion  heat produced through radioactive decay  and possibly heat from other sources  the major heat-producing isotopes in the earth are potassium-40  uranium-238  uranium-235  and thorium-232.[2  at the center of the planet  the temperature may be up to 7,000\xa0k and the pressure could reach 360\xa0gpa 3.6 million atm   3  because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay  scientists believe that early in earth history  before isotopes with short half-lives had been depleted  earth s heat production would have been much higher  heat production was twice that of present-day at approximately 3\xa0billion xa0years ago  4  resulting in larger temperature gradients within the earth  larger rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics  allowing the production of igneous rocks such as komatiites that are not formed anymore today  5       temperature within the earth increases with depth  highly viscous or partially molten rock at temperatures between 650 to 1,200\xa0\xb0c (1,200 to 2,200\xa0\xb0f  are found at the margins of tectonic plates  increasing the geothermal gradient in the vicinity  but only the outer core is postulated to exist in a molten or fluid state  and the temperature at the earth s inner core outer core boundary  around 3,500 kilometres (2,200\xa0mi  deep  is estimated to be 5650 \xb1 600 kelvins  6][7  the heat content of the earth is 1031 joules  1   in earth s continental crust  the decay of natural radioactive isotopes has had significant involvement in the origin of geothermal heat  the continental crust is abundant in lower density minerals but also contains significant concentrations of heavier lithophilic minerals such as uranium  because of this  it holds the largest global reservoir of radioactive elements found in the earth  10  especially in layers closer to earth s surface  naturally occurring isotopes are enriched in the granite and basaltic rocks  11  these high levels of radioactive elements are largely excluded from the earth s mantle due to their inability to substitute in mantle minerals and consequent enrichment in partial melts  the mantle is mostly made up of high density minerals with high contents of atoms that have relatively small atomic radii such as magnesium  mg   titanium  ti   and calcium (ca   10    w kg isotope    years    kg isotope kg mantle    w kg mantle   heat flows constantly from its sources within the earth to the surface  total heat loss from the earth is estimated at 44.2 tw (4.42 \xd7 1013 watts   13  mean heat flow is 65\xa0mw m2 over continental crust and 101\xa0mw m2 over oceanic crust  13  this is 0.087 watt square meter on average (0.03 percent of solar power absorbed by the earth 14     but is much more concentrated in areas where thermal energy is transported toward the crust by convection such as along mid-ocean ridges and mantle plumes  15  the earth s crust effectively acts as a thick insulating blanket which must be pierced by fluid conduits  of magma  water or other  in order to release the heat underneath  more of the heat in the earth is lost through plate tectonics  by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges  the final major mode of heat loss is by conduction through the lithosphere  the majority of which occurs in the oceans due to the crust there being much thinner and younger than under the continents  13][16   the heat of the earth is replenished by radioactive decay at a rate of 30 tw  17  the global geothermal flow rates are more than twice the rate of human energy consumption from all primary sources   heat from earth s interior can be used as an energy source  known as geothermal energy  the geothermal gradient has been used for space heating and bathing since ancient roman times  and more recently for generating electricity  as the human population continues to grow  so does energy use and the correlating environmental impacts that are consistent with global primary sources of energy  this has caused a growing interest in finding sources of energy that are renewable and have reduced greenhouse gas emissions  in areas of high geothermal energy density  current technology allows for the generation of electrical power because of the corresponding high temperatures  generating electrical power from geothermal resources requires no fuel while providing true baseload energy at a reliability rate that constantly exceeds 90%.[10  in order to extract geothermal energy  it is necessary to efficiently transfer heat from a geothermal reservoir to a power plant  where electrical energy is converted from heat  10  on a worldwide scale  the heat stored in earth s interior provides an energy that is still seen as an exotic source  about 10 gw of geothermal electric capacity is installed around the world as of 2007  generating 0.3  of global electricity demand  an additional 28 gw of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district heating  space heating  spas  industrial processes  desalination and agricultural applications  1  because heat is flowing through every square meter of land  it can be used for a source of energy for heating  air conditioning  hvac  and ventilating systems using ground source heat pumps  in areas where modest heat flow is present  geothermal energy can be used for industrial applications that presently rely on fossil fuels  10   the geothermal gradient varies with location and is typically measured by determining the bottom open-hole temperature after borehole drilling  to achieve accuracy the drilling fluid needs time to reach the ambient temperature  this is not always achievable for practical reasons   in stable tectonic areas in the tropics a temperature-depth plot will converge to the annual average surface temperature  however  in areas where deep permafrost developed during the pleistocene a low temperature anomaly can be observed that persists down to several hundred metres  18  the suwa u0142ki cold anomaly in poland has led to the recognition that similar thermal disturbances related to pleistocene-holocene climatic changes are recorded in boreholes throughout poland  as well as in alaska  northern canada  and siberia   in areas of holocene uplift and erosion  fig  1  the initial gradient will be higher than the average until it reaches an inflection point where it reaches the stabilized heat-flow regime  if the gradient of the stabilized regime is projected above the inflection point to its intersect with present-day annual average temperature  the height of this intersect above present-day surface level gives a measure of the extent of holocene uplift and erosion  in areas of holocene subsidence and deposition  fig  2  the initial gradient will be lower than the average until it reaches an inflection point where it joins the stabilized heat-flow regime   in deep boreholes citation needed   the temperature of the rock below the inflection point generally increases with depth at rates of the order of 20 k km or more  citation needed  fourier s law of heat flow applied to the earth gives q   mg where q is the heat flux at a point on the earth s surface  m the thermal conductivity of the rocks there  and g the measured geothermal gradient  a representative value for the thermal conductivity of granitic rocks is m   3.0 w mk  citation needed  hence  using the global average geothermal conducting gradient of 0.02 k m we get that q   0.06 w m xb2  this estimate  corroborated by thousands of observations of heat flow in boreholes all over the world  gives a global average of 6\xd710\u22122 w m xb2  citation needed  thus  if the geothermal heat flow rising through an acre of granite terrain could be efficiently captured  it would light four 60 watt light bulbs   a variation in surface temperature induced by climate changes and the milankovitch cycle can penetrate below the earth s surface and produce an oscillation in the geothermal gradient with periods varying from daily to tens of thousands of years and an amplitude which decreases with depth and having a scale depth of several kilometers  19][20  melt water from the polar ice caps flowing along ocean bottoms tends to maintain a constant geothermal gradient throughout the earth s surface  19   if that rate of temperature change were constant  temperatures deep in the earth would soon reach the point where all known rocks would eventually melt  we know  however  that the earth s mantle is solid because of the transmission of s-waves  the temperature gradient dramatically decreases with depth for two reasons  first  radioactive heat production is concentrated within the crust of the earth  and particularly within the upper part of the crust  as concentrations of uranium  thorium  and potassium are highest there  these three elements are the main producers of radioactive heat within the earth  second  the mechanism of thermal transport changes from conduction  as within the rigid tectonic plates  to convection  in the portion of earth s mantle that convects  despite its solidity  most of the earth s mantle behaves over long time-scales as a fluid  and heat is transported by advection  or material transport  thus  the geothermal gradient within the bulk of earth s mantle is of the order of 0.5 kelvin per kilometer  and is determined by the adiabatic gradient associated with mantle material  peridotite in the upper mantle   21   this heating up can be both beneficial or detrimental in terms of engineering  geothermal energy can be used as a means for generating electricity  by using the heat of the surrounding layers of rock underground to heat water and then routing the steam from this process through a turbine connected to a generator   on the other hand  drill bits have to be cooled not only because of the friction created by the process of drilling itself but also because of the heat of the surrounding rock at great depth  very deep mines  like some gold mines in south africa  need the air inside to be cooled and circulated to allow miners to work at such great depth    geothermal resources   doe eia-0603(95  background
