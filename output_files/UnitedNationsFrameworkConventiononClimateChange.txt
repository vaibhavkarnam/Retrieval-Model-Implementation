UnitedNationsFrameworkConventiononClimateChange
 the united nations framework convention on climate change  unfccc  is an international environmental treaty negotiated at the earth summit in rio de janeiro from 3 to 14 june 1992  then entered into force on 21 march 1994  the unfccc objective is to  stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system   3  the framework set no binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries and contains no enforcement mechanisms  instead  the framework outlines how specific international treaties  called  protocols  or  agreements   may be negotiated to set binding limits on greenhouse gases   initially an intergovernmental negotiating committee produced the text of the framework convention during its meeting in new york from 30 april to 9 may 1992  the unfccc was adopted on 9 may 1992  and opened for signature on 4 june 1992.[4  unfccc has 197 parties as of december 2015  the convention enjoys broad legitimacy  largely due to its nearly universal membership  5   the parties to the convention have met annually from 1995 in conferences of the parties  cop  to assess progress in dealing with climate change  in 1997  the kyoto protocol was concluded and established legally binding obligations for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the period 2008-2012.[6  the 2010 canc xfan agreements state that future global warming should be limited to below 2.0\xa0\xb0c (3.6\xa0\xb0f  relative to the pre-industrial level  7  the protocol was amended in 2012 to encompass the period 2013-2020 in the doha amendment  which -as of december 2015- not entered into force  in 2015 the paris agreement was adopted  governing emission reductions from 2020 on through commitments of countries in ambitious nationally determined contributions   one of the first tasks set by the unfccc was for signatory nations to establish national greenhouse gas inventories of greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions and removals  which were used to create the 1990 benchmark levels for accession of annex i countries to the kyoto protocol and for the commitment of those countries to ghg reductions  updated inventories must be regularly submitted by annex i countries   the unfccc is also the name of the united nations secretariat charged with supporting the operation of the convention  with offices in haus carstanjen  and un campus  known as langer eugen  bonn  germany  from 2010 to 2016 the head of the secretariat was christiana figueres  in july 2016  patricia espinosa from mexico succeeded figueres  the secretariat  augmented through the parallel efforts of the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc   aims to gain consensus through meetings and the discussion of various strategies       the united nations framework convention on climate change  unfccc  was opened for signature at the 1992 united nations conference on environment and development  unced  in rio de janeiro  known by its popular title  the earth summit   on 12 june 1992  154 nations signed the unfccc  that upon ratification committed signatories  governments to reduce atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases with the goal of  preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with earth s climate system   this commitment would require substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions  see the later section   stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations    article 3(1  of the convention 8  states that parties should act to protect the climate system on the basis of  common but differentiated responsibilities   and that developed country parties should  take the lead  in addressing climate change  under article 4  all parties make general commitments to address climate change through  for example  climate change mitigation and adapting to the eventual impacts of climate change  9  article 4(7  states  10   the extent to which developing country parties will effectively implement their commitments under the convention will depend on the effective implementation by developed country parties of their commitments under the convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country parties   the framework convention specifies the aim of developed  annex i  parties stabilizing their greenhouse gas emissions  carbon dioxide and other anthropogenic greenhouse gases not regulated under the montreal protocol  at 1990 levels  by the year 2000.[11   after the signing of the unfccc treaty  parties to the unfccc have met at conferences   conferences of the parties  \u2013 cops  to discuss how to achieve the treaty s aims  at the 1st conference of the parties (cop-1   parties decided that the aim of annex i parties stabilizing their emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 was  not adequate   12  and further discussions at later conferences led to the kyoto protocol  the kyoto protocol sets emissions targets for developed countries which are binding under international law   the kyoto protocol has had two commitment periods  the first of which lasted from 2008-2012  the second one runs from 2013-2020 and is based on the doha amendment to the protocol  which has not entered into force   the us has not ratified the kyoto protocol  while canada denounced it in 2012  the kyoto protocol has been ratified by all the other annex i parties   all annex i parties  excluding the us  have participated in the 1st kyoto commitment period  37 annex i countries and the eu have agreed to second-round kyoto targets  these countries are australia  all members of the european union  belarus  croatia  iceland  kazakhstan  norway  switzerland  and ukraine  13  belarus  kazakhstan and ukraine have stated that they may withdraw from the protocol or not put into legal force the amendment with second round targets  14  japan  new zealand  and russia have participated in kyoto s first-round but have not taken on new targets in the second commitment period  other developed countries without second-round targets are canada  which withdrew from the kyoto protocol in 2012)[15  and the united states   in 2011  parties adopted the  durban platform for enhanced action   16  as part of the durban platform  parties have agreed to  develop a protocol  another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the convention applicable to all parties   16  at durban 17  and doha  18  parties noted  with grave concern  that current efforts to hold global warming to below 2 or 1.5\xa0\xb0c relative to the pre-industrial level appear inadequate   in 2015  all  then  196 then parties to the convention came together for the un climate change conference in paris 30 november - 12 december and adopted by consensus the paris agreement  aimed at limiting global warming to less than two degrees celsius  and pursue efforts to limit the rise to 1.5 degrees celsius  19  the paris agreement is to be signed in 2016 and will enter into force upon ratification by 55 countries representing over 55  of greenhouse gas emissions   at the 19th session of the conference of the parties in warsaw in 2013  the unfccc created a mechanism for intended nationally determined contributions  indcs  to be submitted in the run up to the 21st session of the conference of the parties in paris (cop21  in 2015.[20  countries were given freedom and flexibility to ensure these climate change mitigation and adaptation plans were nationally appropriate  21  this flexibility  especially regarding the types of actions to be undertook  allowed for developing countries to tailor their plans to their specific adaptation and mitigation needs  as well as towards other needs   in the aftermath of cop21  these indcs became nationally determined contributions  ndcs  when a country ratified the paris agreement  unless a new ndc was submitted to the unfccc at the same time  22  the 22nd session of the conference of the parties (cop22  in marrakesh focused on these nationally determined contributions and their implementation  after the paris agreement entered into force on the 4th of november 2016.[23   the climate and development knowledge network  cdkn  created a guide for ndc implementation  for the use of decision makers in less developed countries  in this guide  cdkn identified a series of common challenges countries face in ndc implementation  including how to   in addition to the kyoto protocol  and its amendment  and the paris agreement  parties to the convention have agreed to further commitments during unfccc conferences of the parties  these include the bali action plan (2007),[25  the copenhagen accord (2009),[26  the canc xfan agreements (2010),[27  and the durban platform for enhanced action (2012).[28   as part of the bali action plan  adopted in 2007  all developed country parties have agreed to  quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives  while ensuring the comparability of efforts among them  taking into account differences in their national circumstances   29  developing country parties agreed to   nationally  appropriate mitigation actions  namas  context of sustainable development  supported and enabled by technology  financing and capacity-building  in a measurable  reportable and verifiable manner   29  42 developed countries have submitted mitigation targets to the unfccc secretariat  30  as have 57 developing countries and the african group  a group of countries within the un   31   as part of the 2009 copenhagen negotiations  a number of countries produced the copenhagen accord  26  the accord states that global warming should be limited to below 2.0\xa0\xb0c (3.6\xa0\xb0f   26  this may be strengthened in 2015 with a target to limit warming to below 1.5\xa0\xb0c  32  the accord does not specify what the baseline is for these temperature targets  e g   relative to pre-industrial or 1990 temperatures   according to the unfccc  these targets are relative to pre-industrial temperatures  33   114 countries agreed to the accord  26  the unfccc secretariat notes that  some parties       stated in their communications to the secretariat specific understandings on the nature of the accord and related matters  based on which they have agreed to  the accord    the accord was not formally adopted by the conference of the parties  instead  the cop  took note of the copenhagen accord   26   as part of the accord  17 developed country parties and the eu-27 have submitted mitigation targets  34  as have 45 developing country parties  35  some developing country parties have noted the need for international support in their plans   as part of the canc xfan agreements  developed and developing countries have submitted mitigation plans to the unfccc  36][37  these plans are compiled with those made as part of the bali action plan   at berlin  38  canc xfan  39  and durban  40  the development needs of developing country parties were reiterated  for example  the durban platform reaffirms that  40         social and economic development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of developing country parties  and that a low-emission development strategy is central to sustainable development  and that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow to meet their social and development needs  the ultimate objective of the framework convention is to prevent  dangerous  anthropogenic  i e   human-caused  interference of the climate system  3  as is stated in article 2 of the convention  this requires that ghg concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change  food production is not threatened  and economic development can proceed in a sustainable fashion   climate change mitigation scenarios  projected global greenhouse gas emissions  years 2000 to 2100  climate change mitigation scenarios  projected changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations  years 2000 to 2100  climate change mitigation scenarios  projected global mean temperature  years 2000 to 2100  to stabilize atmospheric ghg concentrations  global anthropogenic ghg emissions would need to peak then decline  see climate change mitigation   41  lower stabilization levels would require emissions to peak and decline earlier compared to higher stabilization levels  41  the graph above shows projected changes in annual global ghg emissions  measured in co2-equivalents  for various stabilization scenarios  the other two graphs show the associated changes in atmospheric ghg concentrations  in co2-equivalents  and global mean temperature for these scenarios  lower stabilization levels are associated with lower magnitudes of global warming compared to higher stabilization levels  41   there is uncertainty over how ghg concentrations and global temperatures will change in response to anthropogenic emissions  see climate change feedback and climate sensitivity   42  the graph opposite shows global temperature changes in the year 2100 for a range of emission scenarios  including uncertainty estimates   there are a range of views over what level of climate change is dangerous  43  scientific analysis can provide information on the risks of climate change  but deciding which risks are dangerous requires value judgements  44   the global warming that has already occurred poses a risk to some human and natural systems  e g   coral reefs   45  higher magnitudes of global warming will generally increase the risk of negative impacts  46  according to field et al  (2014),[46  climate change risks are  considerable  with 1 to 2\xa0\xb0c of global warming  relative to pre-industrial levels  4\xa0\xb0c warming would lead to significantly increased risks  with potential impacts including widespread loss of biodiversity and reduced global and regional food security  46   climate change policies may lead to costs that are relevant to article 2.[44  for example  more stringent policies to control ghg emissions may reduce the risk of more severe climate change  but may also be more expensive to implement  46][47][48   there is considerable uncertainty over future changes in anthropogenic ghg emissions  atmospheric ghg concentrations  and associated climate change  42][49][50  without mitigation policies  increased energy demand and extensive use of fossil fuels 51  could lead to global warming  in 2100  of 3.7 to 4.8\xa0\xb0c relative to pre-industrial levels (2.5 to 7.8\xa0\xb0c including climate uncertainty   52   to have a likely chance of limiting global warming  in 2100  to below 2\xa0\xb0c  ghg concentrations would need to be limited to around 450 ppm co2-eq  53  the current trajectory of global emissions does not appear to be consistent with limiting global warming to below 1.5 or 2\xa0\xb0c  54   in decision making  the precautionary principle is considered when possibly dangerous  irreversible  or catastrophic events are identified  but scientific evaluation of the potential damage is not sufficiently certain  toth et al   2001  pp  xa0655\u2013656).[55  the precautionary principle implies an emphasis on the need to prevent such adverse effects   uncertainty is associated with each link of the causal chain of climate change  for example  future ghg emissions are uncertain  as are climate change damages  however  following the precautionary principle  uncertainty is not a reason for inaction  and this is acknowledged in article 3.3 of the unfccc  toth et al   2001  p  xa0656).[55   as of 2015  the unfcc has 197 parties including all united nations member states  united nations general assembly observer state of palestine  un non-member states niue and the cook islands and the supranational union european union  2][56  the holy see is not a member state  but is an observer  56   parties to the unfccc are classified as   there are 43 annex i parties including the european union  57  these countries are classified as industrialized countries and economies in transition  58  of these  24 are annex ii parties  including the european union  60  and 14 are economies in transition  59   the united nations climate change conference are yearly conferences held in the framework of the unfcc  they serve as the formal meeting of the unfcc parties  conferences of the parties   cop  to assess progress in dealing with climate change  and beginning in the mid-1990s  to negotiate the kyoto protocol to establish legally binding obligations for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions  6  from 2005 the conferences have also served as the meetings of parties of the kyoto protocol  cmp   also parties to the convention that are not parties to the protocol can participate in protocol-related meetings as observers  the first conference (cop1  was held in 1995 in berlin  the 3rd conference (cop3  was held in kyoto and resulted in the kyoto protocol  which was amended during the 2012 doha conference (cop18  cmp 8   the latest conference (cop21  cmp11  was held in paris and resulted in adoption of the paris agreement  the next conference is planned november 2016 in marrakech  morocco   a subsidiary body is a committee that assists the conference of the parties  subsidiary bodies include  63   the work under the unfccc is facilitated by a secretariat in bonn  germany  the secretariat is established under article 8 of the convention  it is headed by the executive secretary  the current executive secretary  patricia espinosa  was appointed on 18 may 2016 by united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon and took office on 18 july 2016.[67  she succeeded christiana figueres who held the office since 2010  former executive secretaries have been yvo de boer (2006-2010   joke waller-hunter (2002-2005  and michael zammit cutajar (1995-2002    the overall umbrella and processes of the unfccc and the adopted kyoto protocol have been criticized by some as not having achieved its stated goals of reducing the emission of carbon dioxide  the primary culprit blamed for rising global temperatures of the 21st century   68  at a speech given at his alma mater  todd stern xa0\u2014 the us climate change envoy xa0\u2014 has expressed the challenges with the unfccc process as follows  \u201cclimate change is not a conventional environmental issue   it implicates virtually every aspect of a state s economy  so it makes countries nervous about growth and development  this is an economic issue every bit as it is an environmental one  u201d he went on to explain that  the united nations framework convention on climate change is a multilateral body concerned with climate change and can be an inefficient system for enacting international policy  because the framework system includes over 190 countries and because negotiations are governed by consensus  small groups of countries can often block progress  69   the failure to achieve meaningful progress and reach effective-co2 reducing-policy treaties among the parties over the past eighteen years have driven some countries like the united states to never ratify the unfccc s largest body of work xa0\u2014 the kyoto protocol  in large part because the treaty didn t cover developing countries who now include the largest co2 emitters  however  this fails to consider the historical responsibility for climate change since industrialisation  which is a contentious issue in the talks  and the responsibility of emissions from consumption and importation of goods  70  it has also led canada to withdraw from the kyoto protocol out of a desire to not force its citizens to pay penalties that would result in wealth transfers out of canada  canada formally withdrew from the kyoto protocol in 2011.[71  both the us and canada are looking at voluntary emissions reduction schemes that they can implement internally to curb carbon dioxide emissions outside the kyoto protocol  72   the perceived lack of progress has also led some countries to seek and focus on alternative high-value activities like the creation of the climate and clean air coalition to reduce short-lived climate pollutants which seeks to regulate short-lived pollutants such as methane  black carbon and hydrofluorocarbons  hfcs  which together are believed to account for up to 1/3 of current global warming but whose regulation is not as fraught with wide economic impacts and opposition  73   in 2010  japan stated that it will not sign up to a second kyoto term  because it would impose restrictions on it not faced by its main economic competitors  china  india and indonesia  74  a similar indication was given by the prime minister of new zealand in november 2012.[75  at the 2012 conference  last minute objections at the conference by russia  ukraine  belarus and kazakhstan were ignored by the governing officials  and they have indicated that they will likely withdraw or not ratify the treaty  76  these defections place additional pressures on the unfccc process that is seen by some as cumbersome and expensive  in the uk alone the climate change department has taken over 3,000 flights in two years at a cost of over \u20a41,300,000  british pounds   77   before the 2015 united nations climate change conference  national geographic magazine added criticism  writing   since 1992  when the world u2019s nations agreed at rio de janeiro to avoid  dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system   they u2019ve met 20 times without moving the needle on carbon emissions  in that interval we u2019ve added almost as much carbon to the atmosphere as we did in the previous century   78   benchmarking is the setting of a policy target based on some frame of reference  79  an example of benchmarking is the unfccc s original target of annex i parties limiting their greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000  goldemberg et al  (1996)[80  commented on the economic implications of this target  although the target applies equally to all annex i parties  the economic costs of meeting the target would likely vary between parties  for example  countries with initially high levels of energy efficiency might find it more costly to meet the target than countries with lower levels of energy efficiency  from this perspective  the unfccc target could be viewed as inequitable  i e   unfair   benchmarking has also been discussed in relation to the first-round emissions targets specified in the kyoto protocol  see views on the kyoto protocol and kyoto protocol and government action
