Hydroelectricity
 hydroelectricity is electricity produced from hydropower  in 2015 hydropower generated 16.6  of the world s total electricity and 70  of all renewable electricity  1  and was expected to increase about 3.1  each year for the next 25 years   hydropower is produced in 150 countries  with the asia-pacific region generating 33 percent of global hydropower in 2013  china is the largest hydroelectricity producer  with 920 twh of production in 2013  representing 16.9 percent of domestic electricity use   the cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low  making it a competitive source of renewable electricity  the hydro station consumes no water  unlike coal or gas plants  the average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 u s  cents per kilowatt-hour  2  with a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be changed up or down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands  once a hydroelectric complex is constructed  the project produces no direct waste  and has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than fossil fuel powered energy plants  3       hydropower has been used since ancient times to grind flour and perform other tasks  in the mid-1770s  french engineer bernard forest de b xe9lidor published architecture hydraulique which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines  by the late 19th century  the electrical generator was developed and could now be coupled with hydraulics  6  the growing demand for the industrial revolution would drive development as well  7  in 1878 the world s first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at cragside in northumberland  england by william george armstrong  it was used to power a single arc lamp in his art gallery  8  the old schoelkopf power station no  1 near niagara falls in the u s  side began to produce electricity in 1881  the first edison hydroelectric power station  the vulcan street plant  began operating september 30  1882  in appleton  wisconsin  with an output of about 12.5 kilowatts  9  by 1886 there were 45 hydroelectric power stations in the u s  and canada  by 1889 there were 200 in the u s  alone  6   at the beginning of the 20th century  many small hydroelectric power stations were being constructed by commercial companies in mountains near metropolitan areas  grenoble  france held the international exhibition of hydropower and tourism with over one million visitors  by 1920 as 40  of the power produced in the united states was hydroelectric  the federal power act was enacted into law  the act created the federal power commission to regulate hydroelectric power stations on federal land and water  as the power stations became larger  their associated dams developed additional purposes to include flood control  irrigation and navigation  federal funding became necessary for large-scale development and federally owned corporations  such as the tennessee valley authority (1933  and the bonneville power administration (1937  were created  7  additionally  the bureau of reclamation which had begun a series of western u s  irrigation projects in the early 20th century was now constructing large hydroelectric projects such as the 1928 hoover dam  10  the u s  army corps of engineers was also involved in hydroelectric development  completing the bonneville dam in 1937 and being recognized by the flood control act of 1936 as the premier federal flood control agency  11   hydroelectric power stations continued to become larger throughout the 20th century  hydropower was referred to as white coal for its power and plenty  12  hoover dam s initial 1,345 mw power station was the world s largest hydroelectric power station in 1936  it was eclipsed by the 6809 mw grand coulee dam in 1942.[13  the itaipu dam opened in 1984 in south america as the largest  producing 14,000 mw but was surpassed in 2008 by the three gorges dam in china at 22,500 mw  hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries  including norway  democratic republic of the congo  paraguay and brazil  with over 85  of their electricity  the united states currently has over 2,000 hydroelectric power stations that supply 6.4  of its total electrical production output  which is 49  of its renewable electricity  7   the technical potential for the growth of hydropower around the world are  71  europe  75  north america  79  south america  95  africa  95  middle east  82  asia pacific  the political realities of new reservoirs in western countries  economic limitations in the third world and the lack of a transmission system in undeveloped areas  result in the possibility of developing 25  of the remaining potential before 2050  with the bulk of that being in the asia pacific area  14  a few countries are highly developed and have very little room for growth  switzerland 12  and mexico 20    most hydroelectric power comes from the potential energy of dammed water driving a water turbine and generator  the power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water s outflow  this height difference is called the head  a large pipe  the  penstock   delivers water from the reservoir to the turbine  15   this method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations  at times of low electrical demand  the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir  when the demand becomes greater  water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine  pumped-storage schemes currently provide the most commercially important means of large-scale grid energy storage and improve the daily capacity factor of the generation system  pumped storage is not an energy source  and appears as a negative number in listings  16   run-of-the-river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity  so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment  and any oversupply must pass unused  a constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run-of-the-river  in the united states  run of the river hydropower could potentially provide 60,000 megawatts (80,000,000\xa0hp   about 13.7  of total use in 2011 if continuously available   17   a tidal power station makes use of the daily rise and fall of ocean water due to tides  such sources are highly predictable  and if conditions permit construction of reservoirs  can also be dispatchable to generate power during high demand periods  less common types of hydro schemes use water s kinetic energy or undammed sources such as undershot water wheels  tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world  in great britain  there are eight sites that could be developed  which have the potential to generate 20  of the electricity used in 2012.[18   large-scale hydroelectric power stations are more commonly seen as the largest power producing facilities in the world  with some hydroelectric facilities capable of generating more than double the installed capacities of the current largest nuclear power stations   although no official definition exists for the capacity range of large hydroelectric power stations  facilities from over a few hundred megawatts are generally considered large hydroelectric facilities   currently  only four facilities over 10 gw (10,000 mw  are in operation worldwide  see table below  2   small hydro is the development of hydroelectric power on a scale serving a small community or industrial plant  the definition of a small hydro project varies but a generating capacity of up to 10 megawatts  mw  is generally accepted as the upper limit of what can be termed small hydro  this may be stretched to 25 mw and 30 mw in canada and the united states  small-scale hydroelectricity production grew by 28  during 2008 from 2005  raising the total world small-hydro capacity to 85 gw  over 70  of this was in china (65 gw   followed by japan (3.5 gw   the united states (3 gw   and india (2 gw   20   small hydro stations may be connected to conventional electrical distribution networks as a source of low-cost renewable energy  alternatively  small hydro projects may be built in isolated areas that would be uneconomic to serve from a network  or in areas where there is no national electrical distribution network  since small hydro projects usually have minimal reservoirs and civil construction work  they are seen as having a relatively low environmental impact compared to large hydro  this decreased environmental impact depends strongly on the balance between stream flow and power production   micro hydro is a term used for hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 100 kw of power  these installations can provide power to an isolated home or small community  or are sometimes connected to electric power networks  there are many of these installations around the world  particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without purchase of fuel  21  micro hydro systems complement photovoltaic solar energy systems because in many areas  water flow  and thus available hydro power  is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum   pico hydro is a term used for hydroelectric power generation of under 5 kw  it is useful in small  remote communities that require only a small amount of electricity  for example  to power one or two fluorescent light bulbs and a tv or radio for a few homes  22  even smaller turbines of 200-300w may power a single home in a developing country with a drop of only 1\xa0m (3\xa0ft   a pico-hydro setup is typically run-of-the-river  meaning that dams are not used  but rather pipes divert some of the flow  drop this down a gradient  and through the turbine before returning it to the stream   an underground power station is generally used at large facilities and makes use of a large natural height difference between two waterways  such as a waterfall or mountain lake  an underground tunnel is constructed to take water from the high reservoir to the generating hall built in an underground cavern near the lowest point of the water tunnel and a horizontal tailrace taking water away to the lower outlet waterway   a simple formula for approximating electric power production at a hydroelectric station is  \n n n np n  n u03c1 nh nr ng nk n n n   displaystyle p   rho hrgk  n n  where  annual electric energy production depends on the available water supply  in some installations  the water flow rate can vary by a factor of 10:1 over the course of a year   hydropower is a flexible source of electricity since stations can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands  2  hydro turbines have a start-up time of the order of a few minutes  23  it takes around 60 to 90 seconds to bring a unit from cold start-up to full load  this is much shorter than for gas turbines or steam plants  24  power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation  25  hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce base power except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs  26  instead  it serves as backup for non-hydro generators  25   the major advantage of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is their ability to store water at low cost for dispatch later as high value clean electricity  the average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 u s  cents per kilowatt-hour  2  when used as peak power to meet demand  hydroelectricity has a higher value than base power and a much higher value compared to intermittent energy sources   hydroelectric stations have long economic lives  with some plants still in service after 50\u2013100 years  27  operating labor cost is also usually low  as plants are automated and have few personnel on site during normal operation   where a dam serves multiple purposes  a hydroelectric station may be added with relatively low construction cost  providing a useful revenue stream to offset the costs of dam operation  it has been calculated that the sale of electricity from the three gorges dam will cover the construction costs after 5 to 8 years of full generation  28  additionally  some data shows that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk adjusted return  unless appropriate risk management measures are put in place  29   while many hydroelectric projects supply public electricity networks  some are created to serve specific industrial enterprises  dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built to provide the substantial amounts of electricity needed for aluminium electrolytic plants  for example  the grand coulee dam switched to support alcoa aluminium in bellingham  washington  united states for american world war ii airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens  in addition to aluminium power  after the war  in suriname  the brokopondo reservoir was constructed to provide electricity for the alcoa aluminium industry  new zealand s manapouri power station was constructed to supply electricity to the aluminium smelter at tiwai point   since hydroelectric dams do not use fuel  power generation does not produce carbon dioxide  while carbon dioxide is initially produced during construction of the project  and some methane is given off annually by reservoirs  hydro normally has the lowest lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for power generation  30  compared to fossil fuels generating an equivalent amount of electricity  hydro displaced three billion tonnes of co2 emissions in 2011.[31  one measurement of greenhouse gas related and other externality comparison between energy sources can be found in the externe project by the paul scherrer institute and the university of stuttgart which was funded by the european commission  32  according to that study  hydroelectricity produces the least amount of greenhouse gases and externality of any energy source  33  coming in second place was wind  third was nuclear energy  and fourth was solar photovoltaic  33  the low greenhouse gas impact of hydroelectricity is found especially in temperate climates  the above study was for local energy in europe  presumably similar conditions prevail in north america and northern asia  which all see a regular  natural freeze thaw cycle  with associated seasonal plant decay and regrowth   greater greenhouse gas emission impacts are found in the tropical regions because the reservoirs of power stations in tropical regions produce a larger amount of methane than those in temperate areas  34   reservoirs created by hydroelectric schemes often provide facilities for water sports  and become tourist attractions themselves  in some countries  aquaculture in reservoirs is common  multi-use dams installed for irrigation support agriculture with a relatively constant water supply  large hydro dams can control floods  which would otherwise affect people living downstream of the project  35   large reservoirs associated with traditional hydroelectric power stations result in submersion of extensive areas upstream of the dams  sometimes destroying biologically rich and productive lowland and riverine valley forests  marshland and grasslands  damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems  and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife  2  the loss of land is often exacerbated by habitat fragmentation of surrounding areas caused by the reservoir  36   hydroelectric projects can be disruptive to surrounding aquatic ecosystems both upstream and downstream of the plant site  generation of hydroelectric power changes the downstream river environment  water exiting a turbine usually contains very little suspended sediment  which can lead to scouring of river beds and loss of riverbanks  37  since turbine gates are often opened intermittently  rapid or even daily fluctuations in river flow are observed   when water flows it has the ability to transport particles heavier than itself downstream  this has a negative effect on dams and subsequently their power stations  particularly those on rivers or within catchment areas with high siltation  siltation can fill a reservoir and reduce its capacity to control floods along with causing additional horizontal pressure on the upstream portion of the dam  eventually  some reservoirs can become full of sediment and useless or over-top during a flood and fail  38][39   changes in the amount of river flow will correlate with the amount of energy produced by a dam  lower river flows will reduce the amount of live storage in a reservoir therefore reducing the amount of water that can be used for hydroelectricity  the result of diminished river flow can be power shortages in areas that depend heavily on hydroelectric power  the risk of flow shortage may increase as a result of climate change  40  one study from the colorado river in the united states suggest that modest climate changes  such as an increase in temperature in 2 degree celsius resulting in a 10  decline in precipitation  might reduce river run-off by up to 40%.[40  brazil in particular is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on hydroelectricity  as increasing temperatures  lower water \ufb02ow and alterations in the rainfall regime  could reduce total energy production by 7  annually by the end of the century  40   lower positive impacts are found in the tropical regions  as it has been noted that the reservoirs of power plants in tropical regions produce substantial amounts of methane  this is due to plant material in flooded areas decaying in an anaerobic environment  and forming methane  a greenhouse gas  according to the world commission on dams report  41  where the reservoir is large compared to the generating capacity  less than 100 watts per square metre of surface area  and no clearing of the forests in the area was undertaken prior to impoundment of the reservoir  greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir may be higher than those of a conventional oil-fired thermal generation plant  42   in boreal reservoirs of canada and northern europe  however  greenhouse gas emissions are typically only 2  to 8  of any kind of conventional fossil-fuel thermal generation  a new class of underwater logging operation that targets drowned forests can mitigate the effect of forest decay  43   another disadvantage of hydroelectric dams is the need to relocate the people living where the reservoirs are planned  in 2000  the world commission on dams estimated that dams had physically displaced 40-80 million people worldwide  44   because large conventional dammed-hydro facilities hold back large volumes of water  a failure due to poor construction  natural disasters or sabotage can be catastrophic to downriver settlements and infrastructure   during typhoon nina in 1975 banqiao dam failed in southern china when more than a year s worth of rain fell within 24 hours  the resulting flood resulted in the deaths of 26,000 people  and another 145,000 from epidemics  millions were left homeless   the creation of a dam in a geologically inappropriate location may cause disasters such as 1963 disaster at vajont dam in italy  where almost 2,000 people died  45   the malpasset dam failure in fr xe9jus on the french riviera (c xf4te d azur   southern france  collapsed on december 2  1959  killing 423 people in the resulting flood  46   smaller dams and micro hydro facilities create less risk  but can form continuing hazards even after being decommissioned  for example  the small kelly barnes dam failed in 1977  causing 39 deaths with the toccoa flood  twenty years after its power station was decommissioned the earthen embankment dam failed  47   hydroelectricity eliminates the flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion  including pollutants such as sulfur dioxide  nitric oxide  carbon monoxide  dust  and mercury in the coal  hydroelectricity also avoids the hazards of coal mining and the indirect health effects of coal emissions   compared to nuclear power  hydroelectricity construction requires altering large areas of the environment while a nuclear power station has a small footprint  and hydro-powerstation failures have caused tens of thousands of more deaths than any nuclear station failure  36][45][47  the creation of garrison dam  for example  required native american land to create lake sakakawea  which has a shoreline of 1,320 miles  and caused the inhabitants to sell 94  of their arable land for $7.5 million in 1949.[48   however  nuclear power is relatively inflexible  although nuclear power can reduce its output reasonably quickly  since the cost of nuclear power is dominated by its high infrastructure costs  the cost per unit energy goes up significantly with low production  because of this  nuclear power is mostly used for baseload  by way of contrast  hydroelectricity can supply peak power at much lower cost  hydroelectricity is thus often used to complement nuclear or other sources for load following   wind power goes through predictable variation by season  but is intermittent on a daily basis  maximum wind generation has little relationship to peak daily electricity consumption  the wind may peak at night when power isn t needed or be still during the day when electrical demand is highest  occasionally weather patterns can result in low wind for days or weeks at a time  a hydroelectric reservoir capable of storing weeks of output is useful to balance generation on the grid  peak wind power can be offset by minimum hydropower and minimum wind can be offset with maximum hydropower  in this way the easily regulated character of hydroelectricity is used to compensate for the intermittent nature of wind power  conversely  in some cases wind power can be used to spare water for later use in dry seasons   in areas that do not have hydropower  pumped storage serves a similar role  but at a much higher cost and 20  lower efficiency  an example of this is norway s trading with sweden  denmark  the netherlands and possibly germany or the uk in the future  49  norway is 98  hydropower  while it s flatland neighbors are installing wind power   the ranking of hydro-electric capacity is either by actual annual energy production or by installed capacity power rating  in 2015 hydropower generated 16.6  of the worlds total electricity and 70  of all renewable electricity  1  hydropower is produced in 150 countries  with the asia-pacific region generated 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010  china is the largest hydroelectricity producer  with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010  representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use  brazil  canada  new zealand  norway  paraguay  austria  switzerland  and venezuela have a majority of the internal electric energy production from hydroelectric power  paraguay produces 100  of its electricity from hydroelectric dams  and exports 90  of its production to brazil and to argentina  norway produces 98\u201399  of its electricity from hydroelectric sources  50   a hydro-electric station rarely operates at its full power rating over a full year  the ratio between annual average power and installed capacity rating is the capacity factor  the installed capacity is the sum of all generator nameplate power ratings  51   construction suspended 14 days by court order aug 2012[55
