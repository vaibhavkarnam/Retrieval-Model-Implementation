Availabilityfactor
 the availability factor of a power plant is the amount of time that it is able to produce electricity over a certain period  divided by the amount of the time in the period  occasions where only partial capacity is available may or may not be deducted  where they are deducted  the metric is titled equivalent availability factor  eaf   the availability factor should not be confused with the capacity factor  the capacity factor for a given period can never exceed the availability factor for the same period  the difference arises when the plant is run at less than full capacity  in which case the capacity factor is less than the availability factor   the availability of a power plant varies greatly depending on the type of fuel  the design of the plant and how the plant is operated  everything else being equal  plants that are run less frequently have higher availability factors because they require less maintenance and because more inspections and maintenance can be scheduled during idle time  most thermal power stations  such as coal  geothermal and nuclear power plants  have availability factors between 70  and 90   newer plants tend to have significantly higher availability factors  but preventive maintenance is as important as improvements in design and technology  gas turbines have relatively high availability factors  ranging from 80  to 99   gas turbines are commonly used for peaking power plants  co-generation plants and the first stage of combined cycle plants   originally the term availability factor was used only for power plants that depended on an active  controlled supply of fuel  typically fossil or later also nuclear  the emergence of renewable energy such as hydro  wind and solar power  which operate without an active  controlled supply of fuel and which come to a standstill when their natural supply of energy ceases  requires a more careful distinction between the availability factor and the capacity factor  by convention  such zero production periods are counted against the capacity factor but not against the availability factor  which thus remains defined as depending on an active  controlled supply of fuel  along with factors concerning reliability and maintenance  a wind turbine cannot operate in wind speeds above a certain limit  which counts against its availability factor  1  with this definition  modern wind turbines which require very little maintenance  have very high availability factors  up to about 98   photovoltaic power stations which have few or no moving parts and which can undergo planned inspections and maintenance during night have an availability factor approaching or equal to 100
