Thoriumbasednuclearpower
 thorium-based nuclear power is nuclear reactor-based  fueled primarily by the nuclear fission of the isotope uranium-233 produced from the fertile element thorium  according to proponents  a thorium fuel cycle offers several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle u2014including much greater abundance on earth  superior physical and nuclear fuel properties  and reduced nuclear waste production  however  development of thorium power has significant start-up costs  proponents also cite the lack of weaponization potential as an advantage of thorium  while critics say that development of breeder reactors in general  including thorium reactors  which are breeders by nature  increases proliferation concerns  since about 2008  nuclear energy experts have become more interested in thorium to supply nuclear fuel in place of uranium to generate nuclear power  this renewed interest has been highlighted in a number of scientific conferences  the latest of which  thec13[1  was held at cern by ithec and attracted over 200 scientists from 32 countries   a nuclear reactor consumes certain specific fissile isotopes to produce energy  the three most practical types of nuclear reactor fuel are   some believe thorium is key to developing a new generation of cleaner  safer nuclear power  2  according to an opinion piece by a group of scientists at the georgia institute of technology  considering its overall potential  thorium-based power  can mean a 1000  year solution or a quality low-carbon bridge to truly sustainable energy sources solving a huge portion of mankind u2019s negative environmental impact   3   after studying the feasibility of using thorium  nuclear scientists ralph w  moir and edward teller suggested that thorium nuclear research should be restarted after a three-decade shutdown and that a small prototype plant should be built  4][5][6       after world war ii  uranium-based nuclear reactors were built to produce electricity  these were similar to the reactor designs that produced material for nuclear weapons  during that period  the government of the united states also built an experimental molten salt reactor using u-233 fuel  the fissile material created by bombarding thorium with neutrons  the msre reactor  built at oak ridge national laboratory  operated critical for roughly 15,000 hours from 1965 to 1969  in 1968  nobel laureate and discoverer of plutonium  glenn seaborg  publicly announced to the atomic energy commission  of which he was chairman  that the thorium-based reactor had been successfully developed and tested   in 1973  however  the us government settled on uranium technology and largely discontinued thorium-related nuclear research  the reasons were that uranium-fueled reactors were more efficient  the research was proven  and thorium s breeding ratio was thought insufficient to produce enough fuel to support development of a commercial nuclear industry  as moir and teller later wrote   the competition came down to a liquid metal fast breeder reactor  lmfbr  on the uranium-plutonium cycle and a thermal reactor on the thorium-233u cycle  the molten salt breeder reactor  the lmfbr had a larger breeding rate     and won the competition   in their opinion  the decision to stop development of thorium reactors  at least as a backup option  \u201cwas an excusable mistake  u201d 4   science writer richard martin states that nuclear physicist alvin weinberg  who was director at oak ridge and primarily responsible for the new reactor  lost his job as director because he championed development of the safer thorium reactors  7][8  weinberg himself recalls this period    congressman  chet holifield was clearly exasperated with me  and he finally blurted out   alvin  if you are concerned about the safety of reactors  then i think it may be time for you to leave nuclear energy   i was speechless  but it was apparent to me that my style  my attitude  and my perception of the future were no longer in tune with the powers within the aec  9   martin explains that weinberg s unwillingness to sacrifice potentially safe nuclear power for the benefit of military uses forced him to retire   weinberg realized that you could use thorium in an entirely new kind of reactor  one that would have zero risk of meltdown        his team built a working reactor         and he spent the rest of his 18-year tenure trying to make thorium the heart of the nation u2019s atomic power effort  he failed  uranium reactors had already been established  and hyman rickover  de facto head of the us nuclear program  wanted the plutonium from uranium-powered nuclear plants to make bombs  increasingly shunted aside  weinberg was finally forced out in 1973.[10   despite the documented history of thorium nuclear power  many of today u2019s nuclear experts were nonetheless unaware of it  according to chemical  amp  engineering news   most people u2014including scientists u2014have hardly heard of the heavy-metal element and know little about it      noting a comment by a conference attendee that  it s possible to have a ph d  in nuclear reactor technology and not know about thorium energy   11  nuclear physicist victor j  stenger  for one  first learned of it in 2012   it came as a surprise to me to learn recently that such an alternative has been available to us since world war ii  but not pursued because it lacked weapons applications  12   others  including former nasa scientist and thorium expert kirk sorensen  agree that  thorium was the alternative path that was not taken \u2026 "[13][14]:2 according to sorensen  during a documentary interview  he states that if the us had not discontinued its research in 1974 it could have  probably achieved energy independence by around 2000."[15   the world nuclear association explains some of the possible benefits 16   the thorium fuel cycle offers enormous energy security benefits in the long-term \u2013 due to its potential for being a self-sustaining fuel without the need for fast neutron reactors  it is therefore an important and potentially viable technology that seems able to contribute to building credible  long-term nuclear energy scenarios  17   moir and teller agree  noting that the possible advantages of thorium include  utilization of an abundant fuel  inaccessibility of that fuel to terrorists or for diversion to weapons use  together with good economics and safety features \u2026 "[4  thorium is considered the  most abundant  most readily available  cleanest  and safest energy source on earth   adds science writer richard martin  14]:7  summarizing some of the potential benefits  martin offers his general opinion   thorium could provide a clean and effectively limitless source of power while allaying all public concern u2014weapons proliferation  radioactive pollution  toxic waste  and fuel that is both costly and complicated to process  14]:13 from an economics viewpoint  uk business editor ambrose evans-pritchard has suggested that  obama could kill fossil fuels overnight with a nuclear dash for thorium   suggesting a  new manhattan project   and adding   if it works  manhattan ii could restore american optimism and strategic leadership at a stroke \u2026"[25  moir and teller estimated in 2004 that the cost for their recommended prototype would be  well under $1 billion with operation costs likely on the order of $100 million per year   and as a result a  large-scale nuclear power plan  usable by many countries could be set up within a decade  4   a report by the bellona foundation in 2013 concluded that the economics are quite speculative  thorium nuclear reactors are unlikely to produce cheaper energy  but the management of spent fuel is likely to be cheaper than for uranium nuclear reactors  29   some experts note possible specific disadvantages of thorium nuclear power  30   research and development of thorium-based nuclear reactors  primarily the liquid fluoride thorium reactor  lftr   msr design  has been or is now being done in the united states  united kingdom  germany  brazil  india  china  france  the czech republic  japan  russia  canada  israel  and the netherlands  12][14  conferences with experts from as many as 32 countries are held  including one by the european organization for nuclear research  cern  in 2013  which focuses on thorium as an alternative nuclear technology without requiring production of nuclear waste  33  recognized experts  such as hans blix  former head of the international atomic energy agency  calls for expanded support of new nuclear power technology  and states   the thorium option offers the world not only a new sustainable supply of fuel for nuclear power but also one that makes better use of the fuel s energy content   34   candu reactors are capable of using thorium  35][36  and thorium power canada has  in 2013  planned and proposed developing thorium power projects for chile and indonesia  37   the proposed 10 mw demonstration reactor in chile could be used to power a 20 million litre day desalination plant  all land and regulatory approvals are currently in process  38   thorium power canada s proposal for the development of a 25 mw thorium reactor in indonesia is meant to be a  demonstration power project  which could provide electrical power to the country u2019s power grid  38   at the 2011 annual conference of the chinese academy of sciences  it was announced that  china has initiated a research and development project in thorium msr technology   39  in addition  dr  jiang mianheng  son of china s former leader jiang zemin  led a thorium delegation in non-disclosure talks at oak ridge national laboratory  tennessee  and by late 2013 china had officially partnered with oak ridge to aid china in its own development  40][41  the world nuclear association notes that the china academy of sciences in january 2011 announced its r amp d program   claiming to have the world s largest national effort on it  hoping to obtain full intellectual property rights on the technology   17  according to martin   china has made clear its intention to go it alone   adding that china already has a monopoly over most of the world s rare earth minerals  14]:157[19   in march 2014  with their reliance on coal-fired power having become a major cause of their current  smog crisis   they reduced their original goal of creating a working reactor from 25 years down to 10   in the past  the government was interested in nuclear power because of the energy shortage  now they are more interested because of smog   said professor li zhong  a scientist working on the project   this is definitely a race   he added  42   in early 2012  it was reported that china  using components produced by the west and russia  planned to build two prototype thorium msrs by 2015  and had budgeted the project at $400 million and requiring 400 workers   14  china also finalized an agreement with a canadian nuclear technology company to develop improved candu reactors using thorium and uranium as a fuel  43   the german thtr-300 was a prototype commercial power station using thorium as fertile and highly enriched u-235 as fissile fuel  though named thorium high temperature reactor  mostly u-235 was fissioned  the thtr-300 was a helium-cooled high-temperature reactor with a pebble-bed reactor core consisting of approximately 670,000 spherical fuel compacts each 6 centimetres (2.4 in  in diameter with particles of uranium-235 and thorium-232 fuel embedded in a graphite matrix  it fed power to germany s grid for 432 days in the late 1980s  before it was shut down for cost  mechanical and other reasons   india has one of the largest supplies of thorium in the world  with comparatively poor quantities of uranium  india has projected meeting as much as 30  of its electrical demands through thorium by 2050.[44   in february 2014  bhabha atomic research centre  barc   in mumbai  india  presented their latest design for a  next-generation nuclear reactor  that will burn thorium as its fuel ore  once built  with a target date of 2016  they estimate that the reactor could function without an operator for 120 days  45   according to dr r k sinha  chairman of their atomic energy commission   this will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels  mostly imported  and will be a major contribution to global efforts to combat climate change   because of its inherent safety  they expect that similar designs could be set up  within  populated cities  like mumbai or delhi  45   india s government is also developing up to 62  mostly thorium reactors  which it expects to be operational by 2025  it is the  only country in the world with a detailed  funded  government-approved plan  to focus on thorium-based nuclear power  the country currently gets under 2  of its electricity from nuclear power  with the rest coming from coal (60    hydroelectricity (16    other renewable sources (12   and natural gas (9%).[46  it expects to produce around 25  of its electricity from nuclear power  14  in 2009 the chairman of the indian atomic energy commission said that india has a  long-term objective goal of becoming energy-independent based on its vast thorium resources   47][48   in late june 2012  india announced that their  first commercial fast reactor  was near completion making india the most advanced country in thorium research   we have huge reserves of thorium  the challenge is to develop technology for converting this to fissile material   stated their former chairman of india s atomic energy commission  49  that vision of using thorium in place of uranium was set out in the 1950s by physicist homi bhabha  50][51  india s first commercial fast breeder reactor \u2014 the 500 mwe prototype fast breeder reactor  pfbr  \u2014 is approaching completion at the

commissioning  criticality   of the pfbr to sept 2016,[55  but india s commitment to long-term nuclear energy production is underscored by the approval in 2015 of ten new sites for reactors of unspecified types  56  though procurement of primary fissile material \u2013 preferably plutonium \u2013 may be problematic due to india s low uranium reserves and capacity for production  57   in may 2010  researchers from ben-gurion university of the negev in israel and brookhaven national laboratory in new york began to collaborate on the development of thorium reactors  58  aimed at being self-sustaining   meaning one that will produce and consume about the same amounts of fuel   which is not possible with uranium in a light water reactor  58   in june 2012  japan utility chubu electric power wrote that they regard thorium as  one of future possible energy resources   59   in late 2012  norway s privately owned thor energy  in collaboration with the government and

laboratory  nnl  concluded that for the short to medium term      the thorium fuel cycle does not currently have a role to play   in that it is  technically immature  and would require a significant financial investment and risk without clear benefits   and concluded that the benefits have been "overstated   17][29  friends of the earth uk considers research into it as  useful  as a fallback
