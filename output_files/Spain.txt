southwestern europe  with two large archipelagos  the balearic islands in the mediterranean sea and the canary islands off the north african atlantic coast  two cities ceuta and melilla in the north african mainland and several small islands in the alboran sea near the moroccan coast  its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the mediterranean sea except for a small land boundary with gibraltar  to the north and northeast by france  andorra  and the bay of biscay  and to the west and northwest by portugal and the atlantic ocean  it is the only european country to have a border with an african country  morocco  h  and its african territory accounts for nearly 5  of its population  mostly in the canary islands but also in ceuta and melilla   with an area of 505,990\xa0km2 (195,360\xa0sq xa0mi   spain is the largest country in southern europe  the second largest country in western europe and the european union  and the fourth largest country in the european continent  by population  spain is the sixth largest in europe and the fifth in the european union  spain s capital and largest city is madrid  other major urban areas include barcelona  valencia  seville  bilbao and m xe1laga   modern humans first arrived in the iberian peninsula around 35,000 years ago  iberian cultures along with ancient phoenician  greek and carthaginian settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under roman rule around 200 bce  after which the region was named hispania  based on the earlier phoenician name span or spania  10  in the middle ages  the area was conquered by germanic tribes and later by the moors  spain emerged as a unified country in the 15th century  following the marriage of the catholic monarchs and the completion of the eight centuries-long reconquest  or reconquista from the moors in 1492  in the early modern period  spain became one of history s first global colonial empires  leaving a vast cultural and linguistic legacy that includes over 500 million spanish speakers  making spanish the world s second most spoken first language  after mandarin chinese   spain is a democracy organised in the form of a parliamentary government under a constitutional monarchy  it is a middle power and a major developed country 11  with the world s fourteenth largest economy by nominal gdp and sixteenth largest by purchasing power parity  it is a member of the united nations  un   the european union  eu   the eurozone  the council of europe  coe   the organization of ibero-american states  oei   the north atlantic treaty organization  nato   the organisation for economic co-operation and development  oecd   the world trade organization  wto  and many other international organisations       the origins of the roman name hispania  from which the modern name espa xf1a was derived  are uncertain due to inadequate evidence  although it is documented that the phoenicians and carthaginians referred to the region as spania  therefore the most widely accepted etymology is a semitic \u2013 phoenician one  10][12  down the centuries there have been a number of accounts and hypotheses   the renaissance scholar antonio de nebrija proposed that the word hispania evolved from the iberian word hispalis  meaning  city of the western world    jes xfas luis cunchillos argues that the root of the term span is the phoenician word spy  meaning  to forge metals   therefore  i-spn-ya would mean  the land where metals are forged   13  it may be a derivation of the phoenician i-shpania  meaning  island of rabbits    land of rabbits  or  edge   a reference to spain s location at the end of the mediterranean  roman coins struck in the region from the reign of hadrian show a female figure with a rabbit at her feet  14  and strabo called it the  land of the rabbits   15   hispania may derive from the poetic use of the term hesperia  reflecting the greek perception of italy as a  western land  or  land of the setting sun   hesperia  \u1f19\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af u03b1 in greek  and spain  being still further west  as hesperia ultima  16   there is the claim that  hispania  derives from the basque word ezpanna meaning  edge  or  border   another reference to the fact that the iberian peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the european continent  16   two 15th-century spanish jewish scholars  don isaac abravanel and solomon ibn verga  gave an explanation now considered folkloric  both men wrote in two different published works that the first jews to reach spain were brought by ship by phiros who was confederate with the king of babylon when he laid siege to jerusalem  this man was a grecian by birth  but who had been given a kingdom in spain  he became related by marriage to espan  the nephew of king heracles  who also ruled over a kingdom in spain  heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native greece  leaving his kingdom to his nephew  espan  from whom the country of espa xf1a  spain  took its name  based upon their testimonies  this eponym would have already been in use in spain by c  350 bce  17   iberia enters written records as a land populated largely by the iberians  basques and celts  early on its coastal areas were settled by phoenicians who founded western europe xb4s most ancient cities cadiz and malaga  phoenician influence expanded as much of the peninsula was eventually incorporated into the carthaginian empire  becoming a major theater of the punic wars against the expanding roman empire  after an arduous conquest  the peninsula came fully under roman rule  during the early middle ages it came under germanic rule but later  much of it was conquered by moorish invaders from north africa  in a process that took centuries  the small christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula  the last moorish kingdom fell in the same year columbus reached the americas  a global empire began which saw spain become the strongest kingdom in europe  the leading world power for a century and a half  and the largest overseas empire for three centuries   continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status  the napoleonic invasions of spain led to chaos  triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable  prior to the second world war  spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government  which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy  eventually democracy was peacefully restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy  spain joined the european union  experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth   archaeological research at atapuerca indicates the iberian peninsula was populated by hominids 1.2\xa0million years ago  19  in atapuerca fossils have been found of the earliest known hominins in europe  the homo antecessor  modern humans first arrived in iberia  from the north on foot  about 35,000 years ago  20  not in citation given  the best known artefacts of these prehistoric human settlements are the famous paintings in the altamira cave of cantabria in northern iberia  which were created from 35,600 to 13,500 bce by cro-magnon  18][21  archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the iberian peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern europe was repopulated following the end of the last ice age   the largest groups inhabiting the iberian peninsula before the roman conquest were the iberians and the celts  the iberians inhabited the mediterranean side of the peninsula  from the northeast to the southeast  the celts inhabited much of the inner and atlantic sides of the peninsula  from the northwest to the southwest  basques occupied the western area of the pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas  the phoenician-influenced tartessians culture flourished in the southwest and the lusitanians and vettones occupied areas in the central west  a number of cities were founded along the coast by phoenicians  and trading outposts were established by greeks in the north east  eventually  phoenician-carthaginians expanded inland conquering about over half of modern-day spain   during the second punic war  an expanding roman republic captured carthaginian trading colonies along the mediterranean coast from roughly 210 to 205\xa0bc  it took the romans nearly two centuries to complete the conquest of the iberian peninsula  though they had control of it for over six centuries  roman rule was bound together by law  language  and the roman road  22   the cultures of the celtic and iberian populations were gradually romanised  latinised  at differing rates in different parts of hispania  local leaders were admitted into the roman aristocratic class  i  23  hispania served as a granary for the roman market  and its harbours exported gold  wool  olive oil  and wine  agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects  some of which remain in use  emperors hadrian  trajan  theodosius i  and the philosopher seneca were born in hispania  j  christianity was introduced into hispania in the 1st century ad and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century ad  23  most of spain s present languages and religion  and the basis of its laws  originate from this period  22   the weakening of the western roman empire s jurisdiction in hispania began in 409  when the germanic suebi and vandals  together with the sarmatian alans  crossed the rhine and ravaged gaul until the visigoths drove them into iberia that same year  the suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern galicia and northern portugal whereas the vandals briefly established themselves in southern spain before crossing over to north africa and conquering carthage  as the western empire disintegrated  the social and economic base became greatly simplified  but even in modified form  the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire  including christianity and assimilation to the evolving roman culture   the byzantines established an enclave  spania  in the south  with the intention of reviving the roman empire throughout iberia  eventually  however  hispania was reunited under visigothic rule   isidore of seville  archbishop of seville  was an influential philosopher and was much studied in the middle ages in europe  also  his theories were vital to the conversion of the visigothic kingdom to a catholic one  in the councils of toledo  this gothic kingdom was the first christian kingdom ruling in the iberian peninsula  and in the reconquista it was the referent for the different kingdoms fighting against the muslim rule   in the 8th century  nearly all of the iberian peninsula was conquered (711\u2013718  by largely moorish muslim armies from north africa  these conquests were part of the expansion of the umayyad caliphate  only a small area in the mountainous north-west of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion   under islamic law  christians and jews were given the subordinate status of dhimmi  this status permitted christians and jews to practice their religions as people of the book but they were required to pay a special tax and had legal and social rights inferior to those of muslims  24][25   conversion to islam proceeded at an increasing pace  the mulad xedes  muslims of ethnic iberian origin  are believed to have comprised the majority of the population of al-andalus by the end of the 10th century  26][27   the muslim community in the iberian peninsula was itself diverse and beset by social tensions  the berber people of north africa  who had provided the bulk of the invading armies  clashed with the arab leadership from the middle east  k  over time  large moorish populations became established  especially in the guadalquivir river valley  the coastal plain of valencia  the ebro river valley and  towards the end of this period  in the mountainous region of granada  27   c xf3rdoba  the capital of the caliphate since abd-ar-rahman iii  was the largest  richest and most sophisticated city in western europe  mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished  muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the middle east and north africa  muslim and jewish scholars played an important part in reviving and expanding classical greek learning in western europe  some important philosophers at the time were averroes  ibn arabi and maimonides  the romanised cultures of the iberian peninsula interacted with muslim and jewish cultures in complex ways  giving the region a distinctive culture  27  outside the cities  where the vast majority lived  the land ownership system from roman times remained largely intact as muslim leaders rarely dispossessed landowners and the introduction of new crops and techniques led to an expansion of agriculture   in the 11th century  the muslim holdings fractured into rival taifa kingdoms  allowing the small christian states the opportunity to greatly enlarge their territories  27  the arrival from north africa of the islamic ruling sects of the almoravids and the almohads restored unity upon the muslim holdings  with a stricter  less tolerant application of islam  and saw a revival in muslim fortunes  this re-united islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed christian gains   the reconquista  reconquest  was the centuries-long period in which christian rule was re-established over the iberian peninsula  the reconquista is viewed as beginning with the battle of covadonga won by don pelayo in 722 and was concurrent with the period of muslim rule on the iberian peninsula  the christian army s victory over muslim forces led to the creation of the christian kingdom of asturias along the northwestern coastal mountains  shortly after  in 739  muslim forces were driven from galicia  which was to eventually host one of medieval europe s holiest sites  santiago de compostela and was incorporated into the new christian kingdom  the kingdom of le xf3n was the strongest christian kingdom for centuries  in 1188 the first modern parliamentary session in europe was held in le xf3n  cortes of le xf3n   the kingdom of castile  formed from leonese territory  was its successor as strongest kingdom  the kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period  the example of the roman emperors influenced the political objective of the crown  while the nobles benefited from feudalism   muslim armies had also moved north of the pyrenees but they were defeated by frankish forces at the battle of poitiers  frankia  later  frankish forces established christian counties on the southern side of the pyrenees  these areas were to grow into the kingdoms of navarre and aragon  28  for several centuries  the fluctuating frontier between the muslim and christian controlled areas of iberia was along the ebro and douro valleys   the county of barcelona and the kingdom of aragon entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the mediterranean  in 1229 majorca was conquered  so was valencia in 1238   the break-up of al-andalus into the competing taifa kingdoms helped the long embattled iberian christian kingdoms gain the initiative  the capture of the strategically central city of toledo in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the christian kingdoms  following a great muslim resurgence in the 12th century  the great moorish strongholds in the south fell to christian spain in the 13th century u2014c xf3rdoba in 1236 and seville in 1248  after 800 years of muslim presence in spain  the last nasrid sultanate of granada  a tributary state would finally surrender in 1492 to the catholic monarchs queen isabella i of castile 29  and king ferdinand ii of aragon  30][31][32   from the mid 13th century  literature and philosophy started to flourish again in the christian peninsular kingdoms  based on roman and gothic traditions  an important philosopher from this time is ramon llull  abraham cresques was a prominent jewish cartographer  roman law and its institutions were the model for the legislators  the king alfonso x of castile focused on strengthening this roman and gothic past  and also on linking the iberian christian kingdoms with the rest of medieval european christendom  he worked for being elected emperor of the holy roman empire and published the siete partidas code  the toledo school of translators is the name that commonly describes the group of scholars who worked together in the city of toledo during the 12th and 13th centuries  to translate many of the philosophical and scientific works from classical arabic  ancient greek  and ancient hebrew  the islamic transmission of the classics is the main islamic contributions to medieval europe  the castilian language u2014more commonly known  especially later in history and at present  as  spanish  after becoming the national language and lingua franca of spain u2014evolved from vulgar latin  as did other romance languages of spain like the catalan  asturian and galician languages  as well as other romance languages in latin europe  basque  the only non-romance language in spain  continued evolving from early basque to medieval  the glosas emilianenses founded in the monasteries of san mill xe1n de la cogolla contain the first written words in both basque and spanish  having the first become an influence in the formation of the second as an evolution of latin   in the 13th and 14th centuries  the marinid muslim sect based in north africa invaded and established some enclaves on the southern coast but failed in their attempt to re-establish muslim rule in iberia and were soon driven out  the 13th century also witnessed the crown of aragon  centred in spain s north east  expand its reach across islands in the mediterranean  to sicily and even athens  33  around this time the universities of palencia (1212/1263  and salamanca (1218/1254  were established  the black death of 1348 and 1349 devastated spain  34   in 1469  the crowns of the christian kingdoms of castile and aragon were united by the marriage of isabella i of castile and ferdinand ii of aragon  1478 commenced the completion of the conquest of the canary islands and in 1492  the combined forces of castile and aragon captured the emirate of granada  ending the last remnant of a 781-year presence of islamic rule in iberia  that same year  spain s jews were ordered to convert to catholicism or face expulsion from spanish territories during the spanish inquisition  35  the treaty of granada guaranteed religious tolerance towards muslims  36  and although the tolerance was only partial  it was not until the beginning of the 17th century  following the revolt of the alpujarras  that muslims were finally expelled  l  37   the year 1492 also marked the arrival of christopher columbus in the new world  during a voyage funded by isabella  columbus s first voyage crossed the atlantic and reached the caribbean islands  beginning the european exploration and conquest of the americas  although he remained convinced that he had reached the orient  the colonisation of the americas started  with conquistadores like hern xe1n cort xe9s and francisco pizarro  miscegenation was the rule between the native and the european cultures and people   as renaissance new monarchs  isabella and ferdinand centralised royal power at the expense of local nobility  and the word espa xf1a  whose root is the ancient name hispania  began to be commonly used to designate the whole of the two kingdoms  37  with their wide-ranging political  legal  religious and military reforms  spain emerged as the first world power   the unification of the crowns of aragon and castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern spain and the spanish empire  although each kingdom of spain remained a separate country  in social  political  laws  currency and language  38][39   there were two big revolts against the new habsburg monarch and the more authoritarian and imperial-style crown  revolt of the comuneros in castile and revolt of the brotherhoods in majorca and valencia  after years of combat  comuneros juan l xf3pez de padilla  juan bravo and francisco maldonado were executed and mar xeda pacheco went into exile  germana de foix also finished with the revolt in the mediterranean   spain was europe s leading power throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century  a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the world s leading maritime power  it reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two spanish habsburgs u2014charles i (1516\u20131556  and philip ii (1556\u20131598   this period saw the italian wars  the revolt of the comuneros  the dutch revolt  the morisco revolt  clashes with the ottomans  the anglo-spanish war and wars with france  40   through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance  the spanish empire expanded to include vast areas in the americas  islands in the asia-pacific area  areas of italy  cities in northern africa  as well as parts of what are now france  germany  belgium  luxembourg  and the netherlands  the first circumnavigation of the world was carried out in 1519\u20131521  it was the first empire on which it was said that the sun never set  this was an age of discovery  with daring explorations by sea and by land  the opening-up of new trade routes across oceans  conquests and the beginnings of european colonialism  spanish explorers brought back precious metals  spices  luxuries  and previously unknown plants  and played a leading part in transforming the european understanding of the globe  41  the cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the spanish golden age  the expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from europe devastated american indigenous populations  the rise of humanism  the counter-reformation and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the school of salamanca  which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as international law and human rights   in the late 16th century and first half of the 17th century  spain was confronted by unrelenting challenges from all sides  barbary pirates  under the aegis of the rapidly growing ottoman empire  disrupted life in many coastal areas through their slave raids and the renewed threat of an islamic invasion  42  this was at a time when spain was often at war with france   the protestant reformation dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars  the result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across europe and in the mediterranean  43   by the middle decades of a war- and plague-ridden 17th-century europe  the spanish habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent-wide religious-political conflicts  these conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally  spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered habsburg empire  and help the imperial forces of the holy roman empire reverse a large part of the advances made by protestant forces  but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of portugal  with whom it had been united in a personal union of the crowns from 1580 to 1640  and the netherlands  and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to france in the latter stages of the immensely destructive  europe-wide thirty years  war  44   in the latter half of the 17th century  spain went into a gradual decline  during which it surrendered several small territories to france and the netherlands  however  it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire  which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century   the decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century  the war of the spanish succession was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war  and was to cost the kingdom its european possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the continent  45  during this war  a new dynasty originating in france  the bourbons  was installed  long united only by the crown  a true spanish state was established when the first bourbon king  philip v  united the crowns of castile and aragon into a single state  abolishing many of the old regional privileges and laws  46   the 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire  the new bourbon monarchy drew on the french system of modernising the administration and the economy  enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom s elite and monarchy  military assistance for the rebellious british colonies in the american war of independence improved the kingdom s international standing  47   in 1793  spain went to war against the revolutionary new french republic as a member of the first coalition  the subsequent war of the pyrenees polarised the country in a reaction against the gallicised elites and following defeat in the field  peace was made with france in 1795 at the peace of basel in which spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of hispaniola  the prime minister  manuel godoy  then ensured that spain allied herself with france in the brief war of the third coalition which ended with the british victory at the battle of trafalgar in 1805  in 1807  a secret treaty between napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against britain and portugal  napoleon s troops entered the country to invade portugal but instead occupied spain s major fortresses  the ridiculed spanish king abdicated in favour of napoleon s brother  joseph bonaparte   joseph bonaparte was seen as a puppet monarch and was regarded with scorn by the spanish  the 2 may 1808 revolt was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the bonapartist regime  48  these revolts marked the beginning of a devastating war of independence against the napoleonic regime  49  napoleon was forced to intervene personally  defeating several spanish armies and forcing a british army to retreat  however  further military action by spanish armies  guerrillas and wellington s british-portuguese forces  combined with napoleon s disastrous invasion of russia  led to the ousting of the french imperial armies from spain in 1814  and the return of king ferdinand vii  50   during the war  in 1810  a revolutionary body  the cortes of c xe1diz  was assembled to co-ordinate the effort against the bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution  51  it met as one body  and its members represented the entire spanish empire  52  in 1812 a constitution for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared but after the fall of the bonapartist regime ferdinand vii dismissed the cortes generales and was determined to rule as an absolute monarch  these events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries   spain s conquest by france benefited latin american anti-colonialists who resented the imperial spanish government s policies that favoured spanish-born citizens  peninsulars  over those born overseas  criollos  and demanded retroversion of the sovereignty to the people  starting in 1809 spain s american colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence  leading to the spanish american wars of independence that ended spanish control over its mainland colonies in the americas  king ferdinand vii s attempt to re-assert control proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in spain and army revolts followed  led by liberal officers  by the end of 1826  the only american colonies spain held were cuba and puerto rico   the napoleonic war left spain economically ruined  deeply divided and politically unstable  in the 1830s and 1840s anti-liberal forces known as carlists fought against liberals in the carlist wars  liberal forces won  but the conflict between progressive and conservative liberals ended in a weak early constitutional period  after the glorious revolution of 1868 and the short-lived first spanish republic  a more stable monarchic period began characterised by the practice of turnismo  the rotation of government control between progressive and conservative liberals within the spanish government    in the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the philippines and cuba  in 1895 and 1896 the cuban war of independence and the philippine revolution broke out and eventually the united states became involved  the spanish u2013american war was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of north africa  el desastre  the disaster   as the war became known in spain  gave added impetus to the generation of '98 who were conducting an analysis of the country   although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity  the 20th century brought little peace  spain played a minor part in the scramble for africa  with the colonisation of western sahara  spanish morocco and equatorial guinea  it remained neutral during world war i  see spain in world war i   the heavy losses suffered during the rif war in morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy   a period of authoritarian rule under general miguel primo de rivera (1923\u20131931  ended with the establishment of the second spanish republic  the republic offered political autonomy to the linguistically distinct regions of basque country  catalonia and galicia and gave voting rights to women  clara campoamor  suffragette leader   victoria kent or dolores ib xe1rruri were some of the first female deputies and federica montseny one of the first female ministers in the world  in the worsening economic situation of the great depression  spanish politics became increasingly chaotic and violent   the spanish civil war broke out in 1936  for three years the nationalist forces led by general francisco franco and supported by nazi germany and fascist italy fought the republican side  which was supported by the soviet union  mexico and international brigades but it was not supported by the western powers due to the british-led policy of non-intervention  the civil war was viciously fought and there were many atrocities committed by all sides  the war claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country  53][54  in 1939  general franco emerged victorious and became a dictator   the state as established under franco was nominally neutral in the second world war  although sympathetic to the axis  the only legal party under franco s post civil war regime was the falange espa xf1ola tradicionalista y de las jons  formed in 1937  the party emphasised falangism  a form of fascism that emphasised anti-communism  nationalism and roman catholicism  given franco s opposition to competing political parties  the party was renamed the national movement  movimiento nacional  in 1949   after world war ii spain was politically and economically isolated  and was kept out of the united nations  this changed in 1955  during the cold war period  when it became strategically important for the us to establish a military presence on the iberian peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the soviet union into the mediterranean basin  in the 1960s  spain registered an unprecedented rate of economic growth which was propelled by industrialisation  a mass internal migration from rural areas to cities and the creation of a mass tourism industry  franco s rule was also characterised by authoritarianism  promotion of a unitary national identity  the favouring of a very conservative form of roman catholicism known as national catholicism  and discriminatory language policies   in february 2016  the government of spain announced it will rename streets named after franco s administration officials with names of women  55   in 1962  salvador de madariaga  founder of the liberal international and the college of europe  met in the congress of the european movement in munich with members of the opposition to franco s regime inside the country and in the exile  there were 118 politicians from all factions  at the end of the meetings a resolution in favour of democracy was made  56][57][58   with franco s death in november 1975  juan carlos succeeded to the position of king of spain and head of state in accordance with the franquist law  with the approval of the new spanish constitution of 1978 and the restoration of democracy  the state devolved much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on autonomous communities  spanish 1977 amnesty law let people of franco xb4s regime continue inside institutions without consequences  even responsibles of some crimes during transition to democracy like the massacre of 3 march 1976 in vitoria or 1977 massacre of atocha   in the basque country  moderate basque nationalism has coexisted with a radical nationalist movement led by the armed terrorist organisation eta  59  the group was formed in 1959 during franco s rule but has continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy  on 23 february 1981  rebel elements among the security forces seized the cortes in an attempt to impose a military backed government  king juan carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters  via national television  to surrender   during the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society  new cultural movements based on freedom appeared  like la movida madrile xf1a and a culture of human rights arose with gregorio peces-barba  on 30 may 1982 spain joined nato  following a referendum after a strong social opposition  that year the spanish socialist workers party  psoe  came to power  the first left-wing government in 43 years  in 1986 spain joined the european economic community  which later became the european union  the psoe was replaced in government by the partido popular  pp  in 1996 after scandals around participation of the government of felipe gonz xe1lez in the dirty war

political reforms in 1976 and 1977  spain s new king juan carlos  known for his formidable personality  dismissed carlos arias navarro and appointed the reformer adolfo su xe1rez as prime minister  66][67  the resulting general election in 1977 convened the constituent cortes  the spanish parliament  in its capacity as a constitutional assembly  for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978.[68  after a national referendum on 6 december 1978  88  of voters approved of the new constitution   as a result  spain is now composed of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities with varying degrees of autonomy thanks to its constitution  which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the spanish nation  the constitution also specifies that spain has no state religion and that all are free to practice and believe as they wish   the spanish administration approved legislation in 2007 aimed at furthering equality between genders in spanish political and economic life  gender equality act   69][70  however  in the legislative branch  as of july 2010 only 128 of the 350 members of the congress were women (36.3%).[71  it places spain 13th

switzerland  germany and belgium  74  for example  all autonomous communities have their own elected parliaments  governments  public administrations  budgets  and resources  health and education systems among others are managed regionally  and in addition  the basque country and navarre also manage their own public finances based on foral provisions  in catalonia  the basque country  navarre

being the highest or first-order administrative division in the country  autonomous communities are integrated by provinces  of which there are 50 in total  and in turn  provinces are integrated by municipalities  in catalonia  two additional divisions exist  the comarques  sing  comarca  and the vegueries  sing  vegueria  both of which have administrative powers  comarques being aggregations of municipalities  and the vegueries being aggregations of comarques  the concept of a comarca exists in all autonomous communities  however  unlike catalonia  these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions   spain s autonomous communities are the first level administrative divisions of the country  they were created after the current constitution came into effect  in 1978  in recognition of the right to self-government of the  nationalities and regions of spain   76  the autonomous communities were to be integrated into adjacent provinces with common historical  cultural  and economical traits  this territorial organisation  based on devolution  is literally known in spain as the  state of autonomies    the basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the statute of autonomy  the statutes of autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical and contemporary identity  the limits of its territories  the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution  77   the governments of all autonomous communities must be based on a division of powers comprising   catalonia  galicia and the basque country  which identified themselves as nationalities were granted self-government through a rapid process  andalusia also took that denomination in its first statute of autonomy  even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country  progressively  other communities in revisions to their statutes of autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical and modern identities  such as the valencian community  78  the canary islands  79  the balearic islands  80  and aragon  81   the autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy  with their own parliaments and regional governments  the distribution of powers may be different for every community  as laid out in their statutes of autonomy  since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical  only two communities u2014the basque country and navarre u2014have full fiscal autonomy  aside of fiscal autonomy  the nationalities u2014andalusia  the basque country  catalonia  and galicia u2014were devolved more powers than the rest of the communities  among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time  in addition  the basque country  catalonia and navarre have police corps of their own  ertzaintza  mossos d esquadra and the polic xeda foral respectively  other communities have more limited forces or none at all  like the polic xeda aut xf3noma andaluza 82  in andalusia or the bescam in madrid   nonetheless  recent amendments to existing statutes of autonomy or the promulgation of new statutes altogether  have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the nationalities and the rest of the regions   finally  along with the 17 autonomous communities  two autonomous cities are also part of the state of autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions  ceuta and melilla  these are two exclaves located in the northern african coast   autonomous communities are subdivided into provinces  which served as their territorial building blocks  in turn  provinces are integrated by municipalities  the existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution  not necessarily by the statutes of autonomy themselves  municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs  and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the state  83   the current provincial division structure is based u2014with minor changes u2014on the 1833 territorial division by javier de burgos  and in all  the spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces  the communities of asturias  cantabria  la rioja  the balearic islands  madrid  murcia and navarre are the only communities that are integrated by a single province  which is coextensive with the community itself  in these cases  the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community   after the return of democracy following the death of franco in 1975  spain s foreign policy priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the franco years and expand diplomatic relations  enter the european community  and define security relations with the west   as a member of nato since 1982  spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities  spain s eu membership represents an important part of its foreign policy  even on many international issues beyond western europe  spain prefers to co-ordinate its efforts with its eu partners through the european political co-operation mechanisms  vague   spain has maintained its special relations with hispanic america and the philippines  its policy emphasises the concept of an ibero-american community  essentially the renewal of the historically liberal concept of  hispanidad  or  hispanismo   as

the spanish succession on behalf of archduke charles  pretender to the spanish throne   the legal situation concerning gibraltar was settled in 1713 by the treaty of utrecht  in which spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to the british crown 84  stating that  should the british abandon this post  it would be offered to spain first  since the 1940s spain has called for the return of gibraltar  the overwhelming majority of gibraltarians strongly oppose this  along with any proposal of shared sovereignty  85  un resolutions call on the united kingdom and spain  both eu members  to reach an agreement over the status of gibraltar  86][87   the spanish claim makes a distinction between the isthmus that connects the rock to the spanish mainland on the one hand  and the rock and city of gibraltar on the other  while the rock and city were ceded by the treaty of utrecht  spain asserts that the  occupation of the isthmus is illegal and against the principles of international law   88  the united kingdom relies on de facto arguments of possession by prescription in relation to the isthmus  89  as there has been  continuous possession  of the isthmus  over a long period   90   another claim by spain is about the savage islands  a claim not recognised by portugal  spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands  therefore claiming that there is no portuguese territorial

and uk  98   by the mid-1990s the economy had recommenced the growth that had been disrupted by the global recession of the early 1990s  the strong economic growth helped the government to reduce the government debt as a percentage of gdp and spain s high unemployment began to drop steadily  with the government budget in balance and inflation under control spain was admitted into the eurozone in 1999   since the 1990s some spanish companies have gained multinational status  often expanding their activities in culturally close latin america  spain is the second biggest foreign investor there  after the united states  spanish companies have also expanded into asia  especially china and india  99  this early global expansion is a competitive advantage over its competitors and european neighbours  the reason for this early expansion is the booming interest towards spanish language and culture in asia and africa and a corporate culture that learned to take risks in unstable markets

autonomous community and the spanish level which makes the identity question in spain complex and far from univocal   spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies  especially latin america and north africa  smaller numbers of immigrants from several sub-saharan countries have recently been settling in spain  there are also sizeable numbers of asian immigrants  most of whom are of middle eastern  south asian and chinese origin  the single largest group of immigrants are european  represented by large numbers of romanians  britons  germans  french and others  143   the arrival of the gitanos  a romani people  began in the 16th century  estimates of the spanish roma population range from 750,000 to over one million  144][145][146][147][148  there are also the mercheros  also quinquis   a formerly nomadic minority group  their origin is unclear   historically  sephardi jews and moriscos are the main minority groups originated in spain and with a contribution to spanish culture  149  the spanish government is offering spanish nationality to sephardi jews  150   according to the spanish government there were 5.7\xa0million foreign residents in spain in 2011  or 12  of the total population  according to residence permit data for 2011  more than 860,000 were romanian  about 770,000 were moroccan  approximately 390,000 were british  and 360,000 were ecuadorian  151  other sizeable foreign communities are colombian  bolivian  german  italian  bulgarian  and chinese  there are more than 200,000 migrants from sub-saharan africa living in spain  principally senegaleses and nigerians  152  since 2000  spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows  despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level  this sudden and ongoing inflow of immigrants  particularly those arriving illegally by sea  has caused noticeable social tension  153   within the eu  spain had the 2nd highest immigration rate in percentage terms after cyprus  but by a great margin  the highest in absolute numbers  up to 2008.[154  the number of immigrants in spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2\xa0million in 2008 out of a total population of 46\xa0million  155][156  in 2005 alone  a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people  157  there are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration  including spain s cultural ties with latin america  its geographical position  the porosity of its borders  the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors  which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce   another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of eu origin typically retiring to spain s mediterranean coast  in fact  spain was europe s largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007  with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2.5\xa0million people arrived  158  in 2008  prior to the onset of the economic crisis  the financial times reported that spain was the most favoured destination for western europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the eu  159   in 2008  the government instituted a  plan of voluntary return  which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the eu to return to their home countries and receive several incentives  including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the spanish social security  160  the programme had little effect  during its first two months  just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer  161  what the programme failed to do  the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs  in 2011 alone  more than half a million people left spain  162  for the first time in decades the net migration rate was expected to be negative  and nine out of 10 emigrants were foreigners  162   spain is openly multilingual  163  and the constitution establishes that the nation will protect  all spaniards

status by law  in all public schools in spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class  catholicism is the religion most commonly taught  although the teaching of islam  174  judaism  175  and evangelical christianity 176  is also recognised in law  according to a june 2016 study by the spanish centre for sociological research about 68  of spaniards self-identify as catholics  2

that atheists and agnostics comprise anywhere from 20  to 27  of the spanish population  4][177][178   altogether  about 9  of the entire spanish population attends religious services at least once per month  4  though spanish society has become considerably more secular in recent decades  the influx of latin american immigrants  who tend to be strong catholic practitioners  has helped the catholic church to recover   there have been four spanish popes  damasus i  calixtus iii  alexander vi and benedict xiii  spanish mysticism was an important intellectual fight against protestantism with teresa of \xc1vila  a reformist nun  ahead  the society of jesus was founded by ignatius of loyola and francisco javier  in the 60s of the 20th century  jesuits pedro arrupe and ignacio ellacur

vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from morocco and other african countries  more than 514,000 (30   of them had spanish nationality  181   the recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of hindus  buddhists  sikhs and muslims  after the reconquista in 1492  muslims did not live in spain for centuries  late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern africa gave a number of residents in spanish morocco and western sahara full citizenship  their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration  especially from morocco and algeria   judaism was practically non-existent in spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century  when jews were again permitted to enter the country  currently there are around 62,000 jews in spain  or 0.14  of the total population  most are arrivals in the past century  while some are descendants of earlier spanish jews  approximately 80,000 jews are thought to have lived in spain prior to its expulsion  182   culturally  spain is a western country  almost every aspect of spanish life is permeated by its roman heritage  making spain one of the major latin countries of europe  spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to catholicism  which played a pivotal role in the country s formation and subsequent identity  spanish art  architecture  cuisine  and music has been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders  as well as by the country s mediterranean climate and geography  the centuries-long colonial era globalised spanish language and culture  with spain also absorbing the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire   it should be noted that after italy (49  and china (45   spain is the third country in the world with the most world heritage sites  at the present time it has 44 recognised sites  including the landscape of monte perdido in the pyrenees  which is shared with france  the prehistoric rock art sites of the c xf4a

lazarillo de tormes  while many religious literature was created with poets as luis de le xf3n  san juan de la cruz  santa teresa de jes xfas  etc   the baroque is the most important period for spanish culture  we are in the times of the spanish empire  the famous don quijote de la mancha by miguel de cervantes was written in this time  other writers from the period are  francisco de quevedo  lope de vega  calder xf3n de la barca or tirso de molina   during the enlightenment we find names such as leandro fern xe1ndez de morat xedn  benito jer xf3nimo feij xf3o  gaspar melchor de

leopoldo alas  clar xedn   concepci xf3n arenal  vicente blasco ib xe1\xf1ez and men xe9ndez pelayo  realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society  as they were   in the spirit of general  realism   realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences  instead of romanticised or stylised presentations   the group that has become known as the generation of 1898 was marked by the destruction of spain s fleet in cuba by us gunboats in 1898  which provoked a cultural crisis in spain  the  disaster  of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political  economic  and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of regeneracionismo  for a group of younger writers  among them miguel de unamuno  p xedo baroja  and jos xe9 mart xednez ruiz  azor xedn   the disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper  more radical literary shift that affected both form and content  these writers  along with ram xf3n del valle-incl xe1n  antonio machado  ramiro de maeztu  and \xc1ngel ganivet  came to be known as the generation of '98   the generation of 1914 or novecentismo  the next supposed  generation  of spanish writers following those of '98 already calls into question the value of such terminology  by the year 1914\u2014the year of the outbreak of the first world war and of the publication of the first major work of the generation s leading voice  jos xe9 ortega y gasset u2014a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the spanish cultural field   leading voices

gasset  and the novelists gabriel mir xf3  ram xf3n p xe9rez de ayala  and ram xf3n g xf3mez de la serna  while still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of '98  they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity  salvador de madariaga  another prominent intellectual and writer  was one of the founders of the college of europe and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the liberal international   the generation of 1927  where poets pedro salinas  jorge guill xe9n  federico garc xeda lorca  vicente aleixandre  d xe1maso alonso  all were scholars of their national literary heritage  again evidence of the impact of the calls of regeneracionistas and the generation of 1898 for spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards   the two main writers in the second half of the 20th century were the nobel prize in literature laureate camilo jos xe9 cela and miguel delibes from generation of '36  spain is one of the countries with the most number of laureates with the nobel prize in literature  and with latin american laureates they made the spanish language literature one of the most laureates of all  the

and brothers david trueba and fernando trueba   actresses sara montiel and pen xe9lope cruz or actor antonio banderas are among those who have become hollywood stars   due to its historical and geographical diversity  spanish architecture has drawn from a host of influences  an important provincial city founded by the romans and with an extensive roman era infrastructure  c xf3rdoba became the cultural capital  including fine arabic style architecture  during the time of the islamic umayyad dynasty  186  later arab style architecture continued to be developed under successive islamic dynasties  ending with the nasrid  which built its famed palace complex in granada   simultaneously  the christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles  developing a pre-romanesque style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream european architectural influences during the earlier middle ages  they later integrated the romanesque and gothic streams  there was then an extraordinary flowering of the gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory  the mud xe9jar style  from the 12th to 17th centuries  was developed by introducing arab style motifs  patterns and elements into european architecture   the arrival of modernism in the academic arena produced much of the architecture of the 20th century
