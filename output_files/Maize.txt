Maize
 maize (/\u02c8me u026az  mayz  zea mays subsp  mays  from spanish  ma xedz after ta xedno mahiz   in the usa also known as corn  is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in mexico 1  about 10,000 years ago  the six major types of corn are dent corn  flint corn  pod corn  popcorn  flour corn  and sweet corn  2   the leafy stalk of the plant produces separate pollen and ovuliferous inflorescences or ears  which are fruits  yielding kernels or seeds  maize kernels are often used in cooking as a starch       most historians believe maize was domesticated in the tehuacan valley of mexico  4  recent research modified this view somewhat  scholars now indicate the adjacent balsas river valley of south-central mexico as the center of domestication  5   the olmec and mayans cultivated maize in numerous varieties throughout mesoamerica  cooked  ground or processed through nixtamalization  it s believed that beginning about 2500 bc  the crop spread through much of the americas  6  the region developed a trade network based on surplus and varieties of maize crops  nevertheless  recent data indicates that the spread of maize took place even earlier  according to piperno    a large corpus of data indicates that it  maize  was dispersed into lower central america by 7600 bp [5600 bc  and had moved into the inter-andean valleys of colombia between 7000 and 6000 bp [5000-4000 bc    5   since then  even earlier dates have been published  7   according to a genetic study by embrapa  corn cultivation was introduced in south america from mexico  in two great waves  the first  5000 years ago  spread through the andes  the second  about 2000 years ago  through the lowlands of south america  8   an influential 2002 study by matsuoka et al  has demonstrated that  rather than the multiple independent domestications model  all maize arose from a single domestication in southern mexico about 9,000 years ago  the study also demonstrated that the oldest surviving maize types are those of the mexican highlands  later  maize spread from this region over the americas along two major paths  this is consistent with a model based on the archaeological record suggesting that maize diversified in the highlands of mexico before spreading to the lowlands  9][10   before they were domesticated  maize plants only grew small  25 millimetres (1\xa0in  long corn cobs  and only one per plant  many centuries of artificial selection by the indigenous people of the americas resulted in the development of maize plants capable of growing several cobs per plant that were usually several centimetres inches long each  11   maize is the most widely grown grain crop throughout the americas  12  with 332 million metric tons grown annually in the united states alone  approximately 40  of the crop u2014130 million tons u2014is used for corn ethanol  13  genetically modified maize made up 85  of the maize planted in the united states in 2009.[14   after the arrival of europeans in 1492  spanish settlers consumed maize and explorers and traders carried it back to europe and introduced it to other countries  spanish settlers far preferred wheat bread to maize  cassava  or potatoes  maize flour could not be substituted for wheat for communion bread  since in christian belief only wheat could undergo transubstantiation and be transformed into the body of christ  15  at another level  spaniards worried that by eating indigenous foods  which they did not consider nutritious  that not only would they weaken  but they risked turning into indians   in the view of europeans  it was the food they ate  even more than the environment in which they lived  that gave amerindians and spaniards both their distinctive physical characteristics and their characteristic personalities   16  despite these worries  spaniards did consume maize and archeological evidence from florida sites indicate they cultivated it as well  17   maize spread to the rest of the world because of its ability to grow in diverse climates  it was cultivated in spain just a few decades after columbus s voyages and then spread to italy  west africa and elsewhere  18  sugar-rich varieties called sweet corn are usually grown for human consumption as kernels  while field corn varieties are used for animal feed  various corn-based human food uses  including grinding into cornmeal or masa  pressing into corn oil  and fermentation and distillation into alcoholic beverages like bourbon whiskey   and as chemical feedstocks   the word maize derives from the spanish form of the indigenous ta xedno word for the plant  mahiz  19  it is known by other names around the world   the word  corn  outside north america  australia  and new zealand refers to any cereal crop  its meaning understood to vary geographically to refer to the local staple  20][21  in the united states  20  canada  22  australia  and new zealand  citation needed  corn primarily means maize  this usage started as a shortening of  indian corn   20   indian corn  primarily means maize  the staple grain of indigenous americans   but can refer more specifically to multicolored  flint corn  used for decoration  23   in places outside north america  australia  and new zealand  corn often refers to maize in culinary contexts  the narrower meaning is usually indicated by some additional word  as in sweet corn  sweetcorn  corn on the cob  baby corn  the puffed confection known as popcorn and the breakfast cereal known as corn flakes   in southern africa  maize is commonly called mielie  afrikaans  or mealie (english   24  words derived from the portuguese word for maize  milho  25   maize is preferred in formal  scientific  and international usage because it refers specifically to this one grain  unlike corn  which has a complex variety of meanings that vary by context and geographic region  21  maize is used by agricultural bodies and research institutes such as the fao and csiro  national agricultural and industry associations often include the word maize in their name even in english-speaking countries where the local  informal word is something other than maize  for example  the maize association of australia  the indian maize development association  the kenya maize consortium and maize breeders network  the national maize association of nigeria  the zimbabwe seed maize association  however  in commodities trading  corn consistently refers to maize and not other grains  citation needed   the maize plant is often 3\xa0m (10\xa0ft  in height  26  though some natural strains can grow 12\xa0m (39\xa0ft   27  the stem is commonly composed of 20 internodes [28  of 18\xa0cm (7.1\xa0in  length  26  a leaf  which grows from each node  is generally 9\xa0cm (4\xa0in  in width and 120\xa0cm (4\xa0ft  in length   ears develop above a few of the leaves in the midsection of the plant  between the stem and leaf sheath  elongating by ~3\xa0mm day  to a length of 18\xa0cm (7\xa0in  [26  with 60\xa0cm (24\xa0in  being the maximum alleged in the subspecies  29  they are female inflorescences  tightly enveloped by several layers of ear leaves commonly called husks  certain varieties of maize have been bred to produce many additional developed ears  these are the source of the  baby corn  used as a vegetable in asian cuisine   the apex of the stem ends in the tassel  an inflorescence of male flowers  when the tassel is mature and conditions are suitably warm and dry  anthers on the tassel dehisce and release pollen  maize pollen is anemophilous  dispersed by wind   and because of its large settling velocity  most pollen falls within a few meters of the tassel   elongated stigmas  called silks  emerge from the whorl of husk leaves at the end of the ear  they are often pale yellow and 18\xa0cm (7\xa0in  in length  like tufts of hair in appearance  at the end of each is a carpel  which may develop into a  kernel  if fertilized by a pollen grain  the pericarp of the fruit is fused with the seed coat referred to as  caryopsis   typical of the grasses  and the entire kernel is often referred to as the  seed   the cob is close to a multiple fruit in structure  except that the individual fruits  the kernels  never fuse into a single mass  the grains are about the size of peas  and adhere in regular rows around a white  pithy substance  which forms the ear  the maximum size of kernels is reputedly 2.5\xa0cm (1\xa0in   30  an ear commonly holds 600 kernels  they are of various colors  blackish  bluish-gray  purple  green  red  white and yellow  when ground into flour  maize yields more flour with much less bran than wheat does  it lacks the protein gluten of wheat and  therefore  makes baked goods with poor rising capability  a genetic variant that accumulates more sugar and less starch in the ear is consumed as a vegetable and is called sweet corn  young ears can be consumed raw  with the cob and silk  but as the plant matures  usually during the summer months   the cob becomes tougher and the silk dries to inedibility  by the end of the growing season  the kernels dry out and become difficult to chew without cooking them tender first in boiling water   female inflorescence  with young silk  mature silk  stalks  ears  and silk  male flowers  full-grown maize plants  mature maize ear on a stalk  planting density affects multiple aspects of maize  modern farming techniques in developed countries usually rely on dense planting  which produces one ear per stalk  31  stands of silage maize are yet denser  32  and achieve a lower percentage of ears and more plant matter   maize is a facultative short-day plant [33  and flowers in a certain number of growing degree days  gt  10\xa0\xb0c (50\xa0\xb0f  in the environment to which it is adapted  34  the magnitude of the influence that long nights have on the number of days that must pass before maize flowers is genetically prescribed 35  and regulated by the phytochrome system  36  photoperiodicity can be eccentric in tropical cultivars such that the long days characteristic of higher latitudes allow the plants to grow so tall that they do not have enough time to produce seed before being killed by frost  these attributes  however  may prove useful in using tropical maize for biofuels  37   immature maize shoots accumulate a powerful antibiotic substance  2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one  dimboa   dimboa is a member of a group of hydroxamic acids  also known as benzoxazinoids  that serve as a natural defense against a wide range of pests  including insects  pathogenic fungi and bacteria  dimboa is also found in related grasses  particularly wheat  a maize mutant  bx  lacking dimboa is highly susceptible to attack by aphids and fungi  dimboa is also responsible for the relative resistance of immature maize to the european corn borer  family crambidae   as maize matures  dimboa levels and resistance to the corn borer decline   because of its shallow roots  maize is susceptible to droughts  intolerant of nutrient-deficient soils  and prone to be uprooted by severe winds  38   maize kernels  maize plant diagram  ear of maize with irregular rows of kernels  while yellow maizes derive their color from lutein and zeaxanthin  in red-colored maizes  the kernel coloration is due to anthocyanins and phlobaphenes  these latter substances are synthesized in the flavonoids synthetic pathway 39  from polymerisation of flavan-4-ols 40  by the expression of maize pericarp color1 (p1  gene 41  which encodes an r2r3 myb-like transcriptional activator 42  of the a1 gene encoding for the dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  reducing dihydroflavonols into flavan-4-ols  43  while another gene  suppressor of pericarp pigmentation 1 or spp1  acts as a suppressor  44  the p1 gene encodes an myb-homologous transcriptional activator of genes required for biosynthesis of red phlobaphene pigments  while the p1-wr allele specifies colorless kernel pericarp and red cobs  and unstable factor for orange1 (ufo1  modifies p1-wr expression to confer pigmentation in kernel pericarp  as well as vegetative tissues  which normally do not accumulate significant amounts of phlobaphene pigments  41  the maize p gene encodes a myb homolog that recognizes the sequence cct aacc  in sharp contrast with the c taacgg bound by vertebrate myb proteins  45   maize flowers may sometimes exhibit mutations that lead to the formation of female flowers in the tassel  these mutations  ts4 and ts6  prohibit the development of the stamen while simultaneously promoting pistil development  46   many forms of maize are used for food  sometimes classified as various subspecies related to the amount of starch each has   this system has been replaced  though not entirely displaced  over the last 60 years by multivariable classifications based on ever more data  agronomic data were supplemented by botanical traits for a robust initial classification  then genetic  cytological  protein and dna evidence was added  now  the categories are forms  little used   races  racial complexes  and recently branches   maize is a diploid with 20 chromosomes (n 10   the combined length of the chromosomes is 1500 cm  some of the maize chromosomes have what are known as  chromosomal knobs   highly repetitive heterochromatic domains that stain darkly  individual knobs are polymorphic among strains of both maize and teosinte   barbara mcclintock used these knob markers to validate her transposon theory of  jumping genes   for which she won the 1983 nobel prize in physiology or medicine  maize is still an important model organism for genetics and developmental biology today  47   the maize genetics cooperation stock center  funded by the usda agricultural research service and located in the department of crop sciences at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign  is a stock center of maize mutants  the total collection has nearly 80,000 samples  the bulk of the collection consists of several hundred named genes  plus additional gene combinations and other heritable variants  there are about 1000 chromosomal aberrations  e g   translocations and inversions  and stocks with abnormal chromosome numbers  e g   tetraploids   genetic data describing the maize mutant stocks as well as myriad other data about maize genetics can be accessed at maizegdb  the maize genetics and genomics database  48   in 2005  the us national science foundation  nsf   department of agriculture  usda  and the department of energy  doe  formed a consortium to sequence the b73 maize genome  the resulting dna sequence data was deposited immediately into genbank  a public repository for genome-sequence data  sequences and genome annotations have also been made available throughout the project s lifetime at the project s official site  49   primary sequencing of the maize genome was completed in 2008.[50  on november 20  2009  the consortium published results of its sequencing effort in science  51  the genome  85  of which is composed of transposons  was found to contain 32,540 genes  by comparison  the human genome contains about 2.9 billion bases and 26,000 genes   much of the maize genome has been duplicated and reshuffled by helitrons u2014group of rolling circle transposons  52   maize reproduces sexually each year  this randomly selects half the genes from a given plant to propagate to the next generation  meaning that desirable traits found in the crop  like high yield or good nutrition  can be lost in subsequent generations unless certain techniques are used   maize breeding in prehistory resulted in large plants producing large ears  modern breeding began with individuals who selected highly productive varieties in their fields and then sold seed to other farmers  james l  reid was one of the earliest and most successful developing reid s yellow dent in the 1860s  these early efforts were based on mass selection  later breeding efforts included ear to row selection   c  g  hopkins ca  1896   hybrids made from selected inbred lines  g  h  shull  1909   and the highly successful double cross hybrids using 4 inbred lines  d  f  jones ca  1918  1922   university supported breeding programs were especially important in developing and introducing modern hybrids   ref jugenheimer hybrid maize breeding and seed production pub  1958  by the 1930s  companies such as pioneer devoted to production of hybrid maize had begun to influence long term development  internationally important seed banks such as international maize and wheat improvement center  cimmyt  and the us bank at maize genetics cooperation stock center university of illinois at urbana-champaign maintain germplasm important for future crop development   since the 1940s the best strains of maize have been first-generation hybrids made from inbred strains that have been optimized for specific traits  such as yield  nutrition  drought  pest and disease tolerance  both conventional cross-breeding and genetic modification have succeeded in increasing output and reducing the need for cropland  pesticides  water and fertilizer  53   cimmyt operates a conventional breeding program to provide optimized strains  the program began in the 1980s  hybrid seeds are distributed in africa by the drought tolerant maize for africa project  53   genetically modified  gm  maize is one of the 25 gm crops grown commercially in 2011.[54  grown since 1997 in the united states and canada  86  of the us maize crop was genetically modified in 2010[55  and 32  of the worldwide maize crop was gm in 2011.[56  as of 2011  herbicide-tolerant maize varieties are grown in argentina  australia  brazil  canada  china  colombia  el salvador  the eu  honduras  japan  korea  malaysia  mexico  new zealand  philippines  the russian federation  singapore  south africa  taiwan  thailand

presence of starlink genetically modified corn  which had been approved only for animal consumption and had not been approved for human consumption  and was subsequently withdrawn from the market  58   maize is the domesticated variant of teosinte  59  the two plants have dissimilar appearance  maize having a single tall stalk with multiple leaves and teosinte being a short  bushy plant  the difference between the two is largely controlled by differences in just two genes  59   several theories had been proposed about the specific origin of maize in mesoamerica  60][61   in the late 1930s  paul mangelsdorf suggested that domesticated maize was the result of a hybridization event between an unknown wild maize and a species of tripsacum  a related genus  this theory about the origin of maize has been refuted by modern genetic testing  which refutes mangelsdorf s model and the fourth listed above  60]:40  the teosinte origin theory was proposed by the russian botanist nikolai ivanovich vavilov in 1931 and the later american nobel prize-winner george beadle in 1932.[60]:10 it is supported experimentally and by recent studies of the plants  genomes  teosinte and maize are able to cross-breed and produce fertile offspring  a number of questions remain concerning the species  among them   the domestication of maize is of particular interest to researchers u2014archaeologists  geneticists  ethnobotanists  geographers  etc  the process is thought by some to have started 7,500 to 12,000 years ago  research from the 1950s to 1970s originally focused on the hypothesis that maize domestication occurred in the highlands between the states of oaxaca and jalisco  because the oldest archaeological remains of maize known at the time were found there   genetic studies led by john doebley identified zea mays ssp  parviglumis  native to the balsas river valley in mexico s southwestern highlands  and also known as balsas teosinte  as being the crop wild relative teosinte genetically most similar to modern maize  62  this has been confirmed by further more recent studies  which refined this hypothesis somewhat  archaeobotanical studies published in 2009 now point to the middle part of the balsas river valley as the more likely location of early domestication  this river is not very long  so these locations are not very distant  stone milling tools with maize residue have been found in an 8,700-years old layer of deposits in a cave not far from iguala  guerrero  63][64][65   also  doebley was part of the team that is credited with first finding  back in 2002  that maize had been domesticated only once  about 9000 years ago  and then spread throughout the americas  9][66   a primitive corn was being grown in southern mexico  central america  and northern south america 7,000 years ago  archaeological remains of early maize ears  found at guila naquitz cave in the oaxaca valley  date back roughly 6,250 years  the oldest ears from caves near tehuacan  puebla  date ca  3,450 bc  6   maize pollen dated to 7300 cal b p  from san andres  tabasco  on the caribbean coast has also been recovered  64   as maize was introduced to new cultures  new uses were developed and new varieties selected to better serve in those preparations  maize was the staple food  or a major staple \u2013 along with squash  andean region potato  quinoa  beans  and amaranth \u2013 of most pre-columbian north american  mesoamerican  south american  and caribbean cultures  the mesoamerican civilization  in particular  was deeply interrelated with maize  its traditions and rituals involved all aspects of maize cultivation \u2013 from the planting to the food preparation  maize formed the mesoamerican people s identity   it is unknown what precipitated its domestication  because the edible portion of the wild variety is too small and hard to obtain to be eaten directly  as each kernel is enclosed in a very hard bivalve shell  it is possible that  early on  teosinte may have been gathered as preferred feed for domestic animals   also  back in 1939  george beadle demonstrated that the kernels of teosinte are readily  popped  for human consumption  like modern popcorn  67  some have argued it would have taken too many generations of selective breeding to produce large  compressed ears for efficient cultivation  however  studies of the hybrids readily made by intercrossing teosinte and modern maize suggest this objection is not well founded   around 2500 bc  maize began to spread to the north  it was first cultivated in what is now the united states at several sites in new mexico and arizona  about 2100 bc  68   during the first millennium ad  maize cultivation spread more widely in the areas north  in particular  the large-scale adoption of maize agriculture and consumption in eastern north america took place about a d  900  native americans cleared large forest and grassland areas for the new crop  69   in 2005  research by the usda forest service suggested that the rise in maize cultivation 500 to 1,000 years ago in what is now the southeastern united states corresponded with a decline of freshwater mussels  which are very sensitive to environmental changes  70   because it is cold-intolerant  in the temperate zones maize must be planted in the spring  its root system is generally shallow  so the plant is dependent on soil moisture  as a c4 plant  a plant that uses c4 carbon fixation   maize is a considerably more water-efficient crop than c3 plants  plants that use c3 carbon fixation  like the small grains  alfalfa and soybeans  maize is most sensitive to drought at the time of silk emergence  when the flowers are ready for pollination  in the united states  a good harvest was traditionally predicted if the maize were  knee-high by the fourth of july   although modern hybrids generally exceed this growth rate  maize used for silage is harvested while the plant is green and the fruit immature  sweet corn is harvested in the  milk stage   after pollination but before starch has formed  between late summer and early to mid-autumn  field maize is left in the field very late in the autumn to thoroughly dry the grain  and may  in fact  sometimes not be harvested until winter or even early spring  the importance of sufficient soil moisture is shown in many parts of africa  where periodic drought regularly causes maize crop failure and consequent famine  although it is grown mainly in wet  hot climates  it has been said to thrive in cold  hot  dry or wet conditions  meaning that it is an extremely versatile crop  71   maize was planted by the native americans in hills  in a complex system known to some as the three sisters  maize provided support for beans  and the beans provided nitrogen derived from nitrogen-fixing rhizobia bacteria which live on the roots of beans and other legumes  and squashes provided ground cover to stop weeds and inhibit evaporation by providing shade over the soil  72  this method was replaced by single species hill planting where each hill 60\u2013120\xa0cm (2.0\u20133.9\xa0ft  apart was planted with three or four seeds  a method still used by home gardeners  a later technique was  checked maize   where hills were placed 40\xa0in (1.0\xa0m  apart in each direction  allowing cultivators to run through the field in two directions  in more arid lands  this was altered and seeds were planted in the bottom of 10\u201312\xa0cm (3.9\u20134.7\xa0in  deep furrows to collect water  modern technique plants maize in rows which allows for cultivation while the plant is young  although the hill technique is still used in the maize fields of some native american reservations  when maize is planted in rows  it also allows for planting of other crops between these rows to make more efficient use of land space  73   in north america  fields are often planted in a two-crop rotation with a nitrogen-fixing crop  often alfalfa in cooler climates and soybeans in regions with longer summers  sometimes a third crop  winter wheat  is added to the rotation   many of the maize varieties grown in the united states and canada are hybrids  often the varieties have been genetically modified to tolerate glyphosate or to provide protection against natural pests  glyphosate is an herbicide which kills all plants except those with genetic tolerance  this genetic tolerance is very rarely found in nature   in the midwestern united states  low-till or no-till farming techniques are usually used  in low-till  fields are covered once  maybe twice  with a tillage implement either ahead of crop planting or after the previous harvest  the fields are planted and fertilized  weeds are controlled through the use of herbicides  and no cultivation tillage is done during the growing season  this technique reduces moisture evaporation from the soil  and thus provides more moisture for the crop  the technologies mentioned in the previous paragraph enable low-till and no-till farming  weeds compete with the crop for moisture and nutrients  making them undesirable   before the 20th century  all maize harvesting was by manual labour  by grazing  or by some combination of those  whether the ears were hand-picked and the stover was grazed  or the whole plant was cut  gathered  and shocked  people and livestock did all the work  between the 1890s and the 1970s  the technology of maize harvesting expanded greatly  today  all such technologies  from entirely manual harvesting to entirely mechanized  are still in use to some degree  as appropriate to each farm s needs  although the thoroughly mechanized versions predominate  as they offer the lowest unit costs when scaled to large farm operations  for small farms  their unit cost can be too high  as their higher fixed cost cannot be amortized over as many units   before world war ii  most maize in north america was harvested by hand  this involved a large numbers of workers and associated social events  husking or shucking bees   from the 1890s onward  some machinery became available to partially mechanize the processes  such as one- and two-row mechanical pickers  picking the ear  leaving the stover  and corn binders  which are reaper-binders designed specifically for maize  for example  video on youtube   the latter produce sheaves that can be shocked  by hand or mechanical picker  the entire ear is harvested  which then requires a separate operation of a maize sheller to remove the kernels from the ear  whole ears of maize were often stored in corn cribs  and these whole ears are a sufficient form for some livestock feeding use  today corn cribs with whole ears  and corn binders  are less common because most modern farms harvest the grain from the field with a combine and store it in bins  the combine with a corn head  with points and snap rolls instead of a reel  does not cut the stalk  it simply pulls the stalk down  the stalk continues downward and is crumpled into a mangled pile on the ground  where it usually is left to become organic matter for the soil  the ear of maize is too large to pass between slots in a plate as the snap rolls pull the stalk away  leaving only the ear and husk to enter the machinery  the combine separates out the husk and the cob  keeping only the kernels   when maize is a silage crop  the entire plant is chopped at once and ensiled in silos or polymer wrappers   for storing grain in bins  the moisture of the grain must be sufficiently low to avoid spoiling  if the moisture content of the harvested grain is too high  grain dryers are used to reduce the moisture content by blowing heated air through the grain  this can require large amounts of energy in the form of combustible gases  propane or natural gas  and electricity to power the blowers  74   maize is widely cultivated throughout the world  and a greater weight of maize is produced each year than any other grain  75  the united states produces 40  of the world s harvest  other top producing countries include china  brazil  mexico  indonesia  india  france and argentina  worldwide production was 817 million tonnes in 2009\u2014more than rice (678 million tonnes  or wheat (682 million tonnes   12  in 2009  over 159 million hectares (390 million acres  of maize were planted worldwide  with a yield of over 5 tonnes per hectare (80 bu acre   production can be significantly higher in certain regions of the world  2009 forecasts for production in iowa were 11614\xa0kg ha (185 bu acre   76  note 1  there is conflicting evidence to support the hypothesis that maize yield potential has increased over the past few decades  this suggests that changes in yield potential are associated with leaf angle  lodging resistance  tolerance of high plant density  disease pest tolerance  and other agronomic traits rather than increase of yield potential per individual plant  77   in 2010  the maize planted area for all purposes in the us was estimated at 35 million hectares (87.9 million acres   79  following an increasing trend since 2008.[80  about 14  of the harvested corn area is irrigated  81   the susceptibility of maize to the european corn borer and corn rootworms  and the resulting large crop losses which are estimated at a billion dollars worldwide for each pest  82][83][84  led to the development of transgenics expressing the bacillus thuringiensis toxin   bt maize  is widely grown in the united states and has been approved for release in europe   maize and cornmeal  ground dried maize  constitute a staple food in many regions of the world   maize is central to mexican food  virtually every dish in mexican cuisine uses maize  in the form of grain or cornmeal  maize is the main ingredient of tortillas  tamales  pozole  atole and all the dishes based on them  like tacos  quesadillas  chilaquiles  enchiladas  tostadas and many more  in mexico even a fungus of maize  known as huitlacoche is considered a delicacy   introduced into africa by the portuguese in the 16th century  maize has become africa s most important staple food crop  85  maize meal is made into a thick porridge in many cultures  from the polenta of italy  the angu of brazil  the m u0103m u0103lig u0103 of romania  to cornmeal mush in the us  and hominy grits in the south  or the food called mealie pap in south africa and sadza  nshima and ugali in other parts of africa  maize meal is also used as a replacement for wheat flour  to make cornbread and other baked products  masa  cornmeal treated with limewater  is the main ingredient for tortillas  atole and many other dishes of central american food   popcorn consists of kernels of certain varieties that explode when heated  forming fluffy pieces that are eaten as a snack  roasted dried maize ears with semihardened kernels  coated with a seasoning mixture of fried chopped spring onions with salt added to the oil  is a popular snack food in vietnam  cancha  which are roasted maize chulpe kernels  are a very popular snack food in peru  and also appears in traditional peruvian ceviche  an unleavened bread called makki di roti is a popular bread eaten in the punjab region of india and pakistan   chicha and chicha morada  purple chicha  are drinks typically made from particular types of maize  the first one is fermented and alcoholic  the second is a soft drink commonly drunk in peru   corn flakes are a common breakfast cereal in north america and the united kingdom  and found in many other countries all over the world   maize can also be prepared as hominy  in which the kernels are soaked with lye in a process called nixtamalization  or grits  which are coarsely ground hominy  these are commonly eaten in the southeastern united states  foods handed down from native americans  who called the dish sagamite   the brazilian dessert canjica is made by boiling maize kernels in sweetened milk  maize can also be harvested and consumed in the unripe state  when the kernels are fully grown but still soft  unripe maize must usually be cooked to become palatable  this may be done by simply boiling or roasting the whole ears and eating the kernels right off the cob  sweet corn  a genetic variety that is high in sugars and low in starch  is usually consumed in the unripe state  such corn on the cob is a common dish in the united states  canada  united kingdom  cyprus  some parts of south america  and the balkans  but virtually unheard of in some european countries  corn on the cob was hawked on the streets of early 19th-century new york city by poor  barefoot  hot corn girls   who were thus the precursors of hot dog carts  churro wagons  and fruit stands seen on the streets of big cities today  86  the cooked  unripe kernels may also be shaved off the cob and served as a vegetable in side dishes  salads  garnishes  etc  alternatively  the raw unripe kernels may also be grated off the cobs and processed into a variety of cooked dishes  such as maize pur xe9e  tamales  pamonhas  curau  cakes  ice creams  etc   maize is a major source of starch  cornstarch  maize flour  is a major ingredient in home cooking and in many industrialized food products  maize is also a major source of cooking oil  corn oil  and of maize gluten  maize starch can be hydrolyzed and enzymatically treated to produce syrups  particularly high fructose corn syrup  a sweetener  and also fermented and distilled to produce grain alcohol  grain alcohol from maize is traditionally the source of bourbon whiskey  maize is sometimes used as the starch source for beer  within the united states  the usage of maize for human consumption constitutes about 1/40th of the amount grown in the country  in the united states and canada  maize is mostly grown to feed livestock  as forage  silage  made by fermentation of chopped green cornstalks   or grain  maize meal is also a significant ingredient of some commercial animal food products  such as dog food   in a 100-gram serving  maize kernels provide 86 calories and are a good source (10-19  of the daily value  of the b vitamins  thiamin  niacin

phosphorus whereas other nutrients are in low amounts  see table on right    maize is a major source of both grain feed and fodder for livestock  it is fed to the livestock in various ways  when it is used as a grain crop  the dried kernels are used as feed  they are often kept on the cob for storage in a corn crib  or they may be shelled off for storage in a grain bin  the farm that consumes the feed may produce it  purchase it on the market  or some of both  when the grain is used for feed  the rest of the plant  the corn stover  can be used later as fodder  bedding  litter   or soil amendment  when the whole maize plant  grain plus stalks and leaves  is used for fodder  it is usually chopped all at once and ensilaged  as digestibility and palatability are higher in the ensilaged form than in the dried form  before the advent of widespread ensilaging  it was traditional to gather the corn into shocks after harvesting  where it dried further  with or without a subsequent move to the cover of a barn  it was then stored for weeks to several months until fed to the livestock  today ensilaging can occur not only in siloes but also in silage wrappers   starch from maize can also be made into plastics  fabrics  adhesives  and many other chemical products   the corn steep liquor  a plentiful watery byproduct of maize wet milling process  is widely used in the biochemical industry and research as a culture medium to grow many kinds of microorganisms  87   chrysanthemin is found in purple corn and is used as a food coloring    feed maize  is being used increasingly for heating  citation needed  specialized corn stoves  similar to wood stoves  are available and use either feed maize or wood pellets to generate heat  maize cobs are also used as a biomass fuel source  maize is relatively cheap and home-heating furnaces have been developed which use maize kernels as a fuel  they feature a large hopper that feeds the uniformly sized maize kernels  or wood pellets or cherry pits  into the fire   maize is increasingly used as a feedstock for the production of ethanol fuel  citation needed  ethanol is mixed with gasoline to decrease the amount of pollutants emitted when used to fuel motor vehicles  high fuel prices in mid-2007 led to higher demand for ethanol  which in turn led to higher prices paid to farmers for maize  this led to the 2007 harvest being one of the most profitable maize crops in modern history for farmers  because of the relationship between fuel and maize  prices paid for the crop now tend to track the price of oil  citation needed   the price of food is affected to a certain degree by the use of maize for biofuel production  the cost of transportation  production  and marketing are a large portion (80   of the price of food in the united states  higher energy costs affect these costs  especially transportation  the increase in food prices the consumer has been seeing is mainly due to the higher energy cost  the effect of biofuel production on other food crop prices is indirect  use of maize for biofuel production increases the demand  and therefore price of maize  this  in turn  results in farm acreage being diverted from other food crops to maize production  this reduces the supply of the other food crops and increases their prices  88][89   maize is widely used in germany as a feedstock for biogas plants  here the maize is harvested  shredded then placed in silage clamps from which it is fed into the biogas plants  this process makes use of the whole plant rather than simply using the kernels as in the production of fuel ethanol   a biomass gasification power plant in strem near g xfcssing  burgenland  austria  began in 2005  research is being done to make diesel out of the biogas by the fischer tropsch method   increasingly  ethanol is being used at low concentrations (10  or less  as an additive in gasoline  gasohol  for motor fuels to increase the octane rating  lower pollutants  and reduce petroleum use  what is nowadays also known as  biofuels  and has been generating an intense debate regarding the human beings  necessity of new sources of energy  on the one hand  and the need to maintain  in regions such as latin america  the food habits and culture which has been the essence of civilizations such as the one originated in mesoamerica  the entry  january 2008  of maize among the commercial agreements of nafta has increased this debate  considering the bad labor conditions of workers in the fields  and mainly the fact that nafta  opened the doors to the import of maize from the united states  where the farmers who grow it receive multimillion dollar subsidies and other government supports        according to oxfam uk  after nafta went into effect  the price of maize in mexico fell 70  between 1994 and 2001  the number of farm jobs dropped as well  from 8.1 million in 1993 to 6.8 million in 2002  many of those who found themselves without work were small-scale maize growers     90  however  introduction in the northern latitudes of the us of tropical maize for biofuels  and not for human or animal consumption  may potentially alleviate this   as a result of the us federal government announcing its production target of 35\xa0billion us gallons (130,000,000\xa0m3  of biofuels by 2017  ethanol production will grow to 7\xa0billion us gallons (26,000,000\xa0m3  by 2010  up from 4.5 billion in 2006  boosting ethanol s share of maize demand in the us from 22.6 percent to 36.1 percent  91   maize is bought and sold by investors and price speculators as a tradable commodity using corn futures contracts  these  futures  are traded on the chicago board of trade  cbot  under ticker symbol c  they are delivered every year in march  may  july  september  and december  92   some forms of the plant are occasionally grown for ornamental use in the garden  for this purpose  variegated and colored leaf forms as well as those with colorful ears are used   corncobs can be hollowed out and treated to make inexpensive smoking pipes  first manufactured in the united states in 1869   an unusual use for maize is to create a  corn maze   or  maize maze   as a tourist attraction  the idea of a maize maze was introduced by the american maze company who created a maze in pennsylvania in 1993.[93  traditional mazes are most commonly grown using yew hedges  but these take several years to mature  the rapid growth of a field of maize allows a maze to be laid out using gps at the start of a growing season and for the maize to grow tall enough to obstruct a visitor s line of sight by the start of the summer  in canada and the us  these are popular in many farming communities   maize kernels can be used in place of sand in a sandboxlike enclosure for children s play  94   stigmas from female maize flowers  popularly called corn silk  are sold as herbal supplements  citation needed   maize is used as a fish bait  called  dough balls   it is particularly popular in europe for coarse fishing   additionally  feed corn is sometimes used by hunters to bait animals such as deer or wild hogs   the breakdown of usage of the 12.1-billion-bushel (307-million-tonne  2008 us maize crop was as follows  according to the world agricultural supply and demand estimates report by the usda  95   in the us since 2009/2010  maize feedstock use for ethanol production has somewhat exceeded direct use for livestock feed  maize use for fuel ethanol was 5,130 million bushels (130 million tonnes  in the 2013/2014 marketing year  96   a fraction of the maize feedstock dry matter used for ethanol production is usefully recovered as ddgs  dried distillers grains with solubles   in the 2010/2011 marketing year  about 29.1 million tonnes of ddgs were fed to us livestock and poultry  97  because starch utilization in fermentation for ethanol production leaves other grain constituents more concentrated in the residue  the feed value per kg of ddgs  with regard to ruminant-metabolizable energy and protein  exceeds that of the grain  feed value for monogastric animals  such as swine and poultry  is somewhat lower than for

digested  these must be sprouted  or prepared and cooked for human consumption  in sprouted or cooked form  the relative nutritional and anti-nutritional contents of each of these staples are different from that of raw form of these staples reported in the table below   when maize was first introduced into farming systems other than those used by traditional native-american peoples  it was generally welcomed with enthusiasm for its productivity  however  a widespread problem of malnutrition soon arose wherever maize was introduced as a staple food  this was a mystery  since these types of malnutrition were not normally seen among the indigenous americans  for whom maize was the principal staple food  103   it was eventually discovered that the indigenous americans had learned to soak maize in alkali-water u2014made with ashes and lime  calcium oxide  since at least 1200\u20131500 bc by mesoamericans and north americans u2014which liberates the b-vitamin niacin  the lack of which was the underlying cause of the condition known as pellagra  104   maize was introduced into the diet of nonindigenous americans without the necessary cultural knowledge acquired over thousands of years in the americas  in the late 19th century  pellagra reached epidemic proportions in parts of the southern us  as medical researchers debated two theories for its origin  the deficiency theory  which was eventually shown to be true  said that pellagra was due to a deficiency of some nutrient  and the germ theory said that pellagra was caused by a germ transmitted by stable flies  a third theory  promoted by the eugenicist charles davenport  held that people only contracted pellagra if they were susceptible to it due to certain  constitutional  inheritable  traits of the affected individual  105   once alkali processing and dietary variety were understood and applied  pellagra disappeared in the developed world  the development of high lysine maize and the promotion of a more balanced diet have also contributed to its demise  pellagra still exists today in food-poor areas and refugee camps where people survive on donated maize  106   maize contains lipid transfer protein  an indigestible protein that survives cooking  this protein has been linked to a rare and understudied allergy to maize in humans  107  the allergic reaction can cause skin rash  swelling or itching of mucous membranes  diarrhea  vomiting  asthma and  in severe cases  anaphylaxis  it is unclear how common this allergy is in the general population   maize has been an essential crop in the andes since the pre-columbian era  the moche culture from northern peru made ceramics from earth  water  and fire  this pottery was a sacred substance  formed in significant shapes and used to represent important themes  maize represented anthropomorphically as well as naturally  108   in the united states  maize ears along with tobacco leaves are carved into the capitals of columns in the united states capitol building  maize itself is sometimes used for temporary architectural detailing when the intent is to celebrate the fall season  local agricultural productivity and culture  bundles of dried maize stalks are often displayed often along with pumpkins  gourds and straw in autumnal displays outside homes and businesses  a well-known example of architectural use is the corn palace in mitchell  south dakota  which uses cobs and ears of colored maize to implement a mural design that is recycled annually   a maize stalk with two ripe ears is depicted on the reverse of the croatian 1 lipa coin  minted since 1993.[109
