ToyotaPrius
 the toyota prius (/\u02c8pri u02d0\u0259s   is a full hybrid electric automobile developed by toyota and manufactured by the company since 1997  initially offered as a 4-door sedan  it has been produced only as a 5-door hatchback since 2003   the united states environmental protection agency and california air resources board  carb  rate the prius as among the cleanest vehicles sold in the united states based on smog-forming emissions  1  the 2016 model year prius eco ranks as the all-time most fuel efficient gasoline-powered car available in the us without plug-in capability  2][3   the prius first went on sale in japan in 1997  and was available at all four toyota japan dealerships  making it the first mass-produced hybrid vehicle  it was subsequently introduced worldwide in 2000.[4  the prius is sold in over 90 markets  with japan and the united states being its largest markets  5  global cumulative prius liftback sales reached the milestone 1\xa0million vehicle mark in may 2008,[6  2\xa0million in september 2010,[7  and passed the 3\xa0million mark in june 2013.[8  cumulative sales of one million were achieved in the u s  by early april 2011,[9  and japan reached the 1\xa0million mark in august 2011.[10  as of january 2017 update   the prius liftback is the world s top selling hybrid car with almost 4\xa0million units sold  11   in 2011  toyota expanded the prius family to include the prius v  an extended hatchback wagon  and the prius c  a subcompact hatchback  the production version of the prius plug-in hybrid was released in 2012  the second generation of the plug-in variant  the prius prime  was released in the u s  in november 2016.[12  the prime achieved the highest miles per gallon equivalent  mpge  rating in all-electric mode of any vehicle rated by epa with an internal combustion engine  13][14  global sales of the prius c variant passed the one million mark during the first half of 2015.[15  the prius family totaled global cumulative sales of 6.1\xa0million units in january 2017  representing 61  of the 10\xa0million hybrids sold worldwide by toyota since 1997.[11       prius is a latin word meaning  first    original    superior  or  to go before   16   in february 2011  toyota asked the public to decide on what the most proper plural form of prius should be  with choices including prien  prii  prium  prius  or priuses  17][18  the company said it would  use the most popular choice in its advertising  19  and on 20 february announced that  prii  was the most popular choice  and the new official plural designation  20  in latin prius is the neuter singular of the comparative form  prior  prior  prius  of an adjective with only comparative and superlative  the superlative being primus  prima  primum   consequently  like all third declension words  the plural in latin was priora  cf  latin declension  which was used by the lada priora in 2007   despite the  official  plural form used by toyota   priuses  remains good english  21  and is the more frequently used plural form   beginning in september 2011  toyota usa began using the following names to differentiate the original prius from some newer members of the prius family  the standard prius became the prius liftback  the prius v  known as the prius \u03b1 in japan  and prius   in europe   the prius plug-in hybrid  and the prius c  called toyota aqua in japan   22][23   in 1995  toyota debuted a hybrid concept car at the tokyo motor show  with testing following a year later  24  the first prius  model nhw10  went on sale on 10 december 1997.[25][26  it was available only in japan  though it has been imported privately to at least the united states  united kingdom  australia  and new zealand  27   the first generation prius  at its launch  became the world s first mass-produced gasoline-electric hybrid car  at its introduction in 1997  it won the car of the year japan award  and in 1998  it won the automotive researchers  and journalists  conference car of the year award in japan   uk sales of the first generation prius began on 19 october 2000.[28   production commenced in december 1997 at the takaoka plant in toyota  aichi  ending in february 2000 after cumulative production of 37,425 vehicles  29  production recommenced in may 2000 at the motomachi plant in the same area  before xw10 manufacture ended in june 2003 after a further 33,411 vehicles had been produced  30   the nhw10 prius styling originated from california designers  who were selected over competing designs from other toyota design studios  26   in the united states  the nhw11 was the first prius to be sold  the prius was marketed between the smaller corolla and the larger camry  the published retail price of the car was us 19,995.[31  the nhw11 prius became more powerful partly to satisfy the higher speeds and longer distances that americans drive  32  air conditioning and electric power steering were standard equipment  33  the vehicle was the second mass-produced hybrid on the american market  after the two-seat honda insight  34  while the larger prius could seat five  its battery pack restricted cargo space  the prius was offered in us in three trim packages  standard  base and touring   the us epa  carb  classified the car with an air pollution score of 3 out of 10 as an ultra low emission vehicle (ulev   35  prius owners were eligible for up to a us 2,000 federal tax deduction from their gross income  34  in contrast with the nw10  toyota executives stated that the company broke even financially on sales of the nhw11 prius  34   european sales began in september 2000.[36  the official launch of the prius in australia occurred at the october 2001 sydney motor show  37  although sales were slow until the nhw20 (xw20  model arrived  toyota sold about 123,000 first generation priuses  8   presented at the april 2003 new york international auto show  for the 2004 us model year  the prius was completely redesigned  it became a mid-size liftback  sized between the corolla and the camry  with redistributed mechanical and interior space significantly increasing rear-seat legroom and luggage room  the new prius is even more environmentally friendly than the previous model  according to the epa   and is 6 inches (150\xa0mm  longer than the previous version  39  its more aerodynamic kammback body balances length and wind resistance  resulting in a drag coefficient of xa0cd 0.26.[40  the development effort  led by chief engineer shigeyuki hori  led to 530 patents for the vehicle  41   production commenced in august 2003 at the tsutsumi plant in toyota  aichi  42  supplemented in october 2004 with the fujimatsu plant at kariya  aichi  43   the prius uses an all-electric a c compressor for cooling  an industry first  44  combined with a smaller and lighter nimh battery  the xw20 is more powerful and more efficient than the xw10.[45  in the us  the battery pack of 2004 and later models is warranted for 150,000 miles (240,000\xa0km  or 10 years in states that have adopted the stricter california emissions control standards  and 100,000 miles (160,000\xa0km  or 8 years elsewhere  46][47  the warranty for hybrid components is 100,000 miles (160,000\xa0km  or 8 years  48   it is classified as a sulev  super ultra low emissions vehicle  and is certified by california air resources board as an  advanced technology partial zero emission vehicle  (at-pzev   49   from 2005 to 2009  the second generation prius had been built by faw-toyota in the city of changchun for the chinese market  50  it was reported that a total of 2,152 priuses were sold in 2006 and 414 in 2007  the relatively low sales was blamed on high price  about us 15,000 higher than the equivalent in japan or the us  caused by high duties on imported parts  51  in early march 2008  toyota cut the price of prius by up to eight percent or us 3,000 to cn xa5259,800 (us 36,500   it was thought that the sales dropped as a result of both a lack of acceptance and increased competition  the honda civic hybrid was exported to china from 2007.[52  toyota sold about 1,192,000-second generation priuses worldwide  8   us national highway traffic safety administration  nhtsa  crash testing of the 2004 us model year prius yielded a five-star driver and four-star passenger rating in the frontal-collision test  out of five stars   side crash results were four out of five stars for both front and rear seats  the car scored four out of five stars in rollover testing  54   us insurance institute for highway safety crash tests scored the prius good overall in frontal collisions and good overall in side-impact collisions in models equipped with side airbags  55  a poor score was given to models without side airbags  56  side curtain and torso airbags became standard on 2007 american models   toyota debuted the new prius (2010 us model year  at the january 2009 north american international auto show  59  and sales began in japan on 18 may 2009.[60  toyota cut the price of the prius from \xa52.331 million to \xa52.05 million to better compete with the honda insight  61  leading some to wonder whether increased sales of the prius might come at the expense of sales of other vehicles with higher margins  competition from lower priced hybrids  such as the honda insight  also made it difficult for toyota to capitalize on the prius s success  62  as of june 2013 update   toyota has sold about 1,688,000 third-generation priuses worldwide  8   at its introduction in 2009  it won the car of the year japan award for the second time   its new body design is more aerodynamic  with a reduced drag coefficient of xa0cd 0.25  this figure is disputed by general motors which found the value for the model with 17-inch wheels to be around 0.30 based on tests in gm  ford  and chrysler wind tunnels  63  car  amp  driver measured the third generation prius at 0.26 in a privately arranged five-way wind-tunnel test of comparable cars  64  an underbody rear fin helps stabilize the vehicle at higher speeds  the roof has a special design of a double wave to keep down the air resistance u2014but this design is not present on the solar roof model  citation needed   the estimated fuel-efficiency rating  using the us epa combined cycle  is 50\xa0mpg u2011us (4.7\xa0l 100\xa0km  60\xa0mpg u2011imp   65  the prius was the most efficient car powered by liquid fuel available in the us in 2009  based on the official rating  66  only the first-generation honda insight (2000\u20132006  equipped with a manual transmission attained a lower fuel consumption rate  the official uk fuel efficiency data for the prius t3 is urban 72.4\xa0mpg u2011imp (3.90\xa0l 100\xa0km  60.3\xa0mpg u2011us   extra urban 76.4\xa0mpg u2011imp (3.70\xa0l 100\xa0km  63.6\xa0mpg u2011us   combined 72.4\xa0mpg u2011imp (3.90\xa0l 100\xa0km  60.3\xa0mpg u2011us   67   the 1.8-liter gasoline engine  previously 1.5 liters  generates 98\xa0hp (73\xa0kw   and with the added power of the electric motor generates a total of 134\xa0hp (100\xa0kw   previously 110\xa0hp or 82\xa0kw   the larger engine displacement allows for increased torque  reducing engine speeds  rpm   which improves fuel economy at highway speeds  thanks to its electric water pump  the prius engine is the first consumer automotive production engine that requires no accessory belts  which also further improves its fuel economy  68  the electric motors and other components of the hybrid powertrain are also smaller and more efficient than the industry average  69  toyota estimates the new inverter  motor and transaxle are 20 percent lighter   in constructing the prius  toyota used a new range of plant-derived ecological bioplastics  made out of cellulose derived from wood or grass instead of petroleum  the two principal crops used are kenaf and ramie  kenaf is a member of the hibiscus family  a relative to cotton and okra  ramie  commonly known as china grass  is a member of the nettle family and one of the strongest natural fibres  with a density and absorbency comparable to flax  toyota says this is a particularly timely breakthrough for plant-based eco-plastics because 2009 is the united nations  international year of natural fibres  which spotlights kenaf and ramie among others  70   to create the third-generation prius for 2010  toyota engineers revisited just about everything to eke out further efficiencies  a new front-drive platform underpinned the car  although the wheelbase remained unchanged and overall length grew by a lone centimetre  weight-saving aluminum was employed in the hood  rear hatch  front axle and brake calipers  disc brakes were finally assigned to all four wheels   71   in december 2013  consumer reports named the prius as the  best value   for the second year in a row  72   high trim levels in the third generation prius include features like softex trim seats  that look and feel just like leather but are lighter in weight   headlight washers  parking sensors  premium jbl speaker system and electrically operated lumbar support adjustment for the driver s seat   in mid-2011  for the 2012 model year   the third-generation prius liftback received modest style and equipment changes  the exterior changes include updated headlamps  revised tail lamps  plus a distinctive front fascia and bumper  and the deletion of the  super white  color option in the united states  prospective american prius buyers wanting a white exterior had to choose the  blizzard pearl  color  a metallic off-white  for an additional $220  or choose another make or model  the prius could be equipped with an updated infotainment system featuring the optional toyota entune suite of connectivity features  other updates included a 6.1-inch touch-screen  an am fm cd player unit  a usb port for ipod connectivity  an auxiliary input jack  a bluetooth hands-free phone capability and streaming audio  the prius also included an optional solar panel on the roof of the car  solely to power a ventilation fan while the car is parked  to keep the interior cooler in sunny conditions   in the us market  only the prius two  three  four and five were offered  the premium prius five model s advanced technology package included the premium hdd navigation system  plus the head-up display  dynamic radar cruise control  pre-collision system and lane keep assist  the pre-collision system retracted the front seatbelts and applies the brakes in certain conditions when it determines that a crash is unavoidable  lane keep assist helped the driver stay within the lane  22  the us 2012 model year included toyota s vehicle proximity notification system  vpns   which emitted an artificial engine noise to alert pedestrians  the blind  and others of the vehicle s presence due to significant noise reduction typical of a hybrid vehicle traveling at low speeds in all-electric mode  73][73   the fourth generation prius was first shown during september 2015 in las vegas  75  and was released for retail customers in japan in december 2015  the launch in north american market occurred in january 2016  and february in europe  74  toyota expected to sell 12,000 fourth generation prius cars a month in japan  and to reach annual sales between 300,000 and 350,000 units  74   in august 2013  toyota managing officer satoshi ogiso  who was chief engineer for the prius line  announced some of the improvements and key features of the next generation prius  76][77  the next prius is the first vehicle to use the toyota new global architecture  tnga  modular platform  which provides a lower center of gravity and increased structural rigidity  these features  along with other improvements allow for gains in ride-and-handling  agility and aerodynamics  the improved aerodynamics contribute to an all-new exterior design  which includes a roomier interior  ogiso also explained that the next-generation prius plug-in hybrid  the prius prime  was developed in parallel with the standard prius model  78][79   the fourth generation prius has stirred controversy over the style and cohesion of its exterior design  with analysis from critics contending that the excessively angular headlamps and unnecessary creases in the bodywork has created a haphazard design  that falls into the trap of equating aggressiveness with sportiness  80   the fourth-generation prius is designed to deliver significantly improved fuel economy in a more compact package that is lighter in weight and lower in cost  these objectives were achieved through the development of a new generation of powertrains with significant advances in battery  electric motor and gasoline engine technologies  it features improved batteries with higher energy density  smaller electric motors  with higher power density than the previous prius motors  and the gasoline engine features a thermal efficiency greater than 40   that of the third-generation prius is 38.5    the prius fuel economy has improved on average by about 10  each generation  and toyota has set the challenge to continue to improve at this rate  78][79   under the japanese jc08 cycle test  toyota expects the fourth generation prius to achieve a fuel economy rating of 40.8\xa0km l (115\xa0mpg u2011imp  96\xa0mpg u2011us   74  the 2016 model year prius has an official epa fuel economy rating of 54\xa0mpg u2011us (4.4\xa0l 100\xa0km  65\xa0mpg u2011imp  for city  50\xa0mpg u2011us (4.7\xa0l 100\xa0km  60\xa0mpg u2011imp  for highway  and 52\xa0mpg u2011us (4.5\xa0l 100\xa0km  62\xa0mpg u2011imp  for combined driving  the new eco version available in mid-grade level two trim  which features lithium-ion batteries  has an official epa rating of 58\xa0mpg u2011us (4.1\xa0l 100\xa0km  70\xa0mpg u2011imp  city  53\xa0mpg u2011us (4.4\xa0l 100\xa0km  64\xa0mpg u2011imp  highway  and 56\xa0mpg u2011us (4.2\xa0l 100\xa0km  67\xa0mpg u2011imp  combined  81  this improved efficiency is largely due to the reduced weight of the eco  which has a lighter battery and does not carry a spare tire  82   in terms of fuel economy  the 2016 prius eco with a combined city highway fuel economy of 56\xa0mpg u2011us (4.2\xa0l 100\xa0km  67\xa0mpg u2011imp   passed the 2000 first generation honda insight 53\xa0mpg u2011us (4.4\xa0l 100\xa0km  64\xa0mpg u2011imp  as the most fuel efficient car available in the us without plug-in capability  however the honda insight still achieves a highway rating of 61\xa0mpg u2011us (3.9\xa0l 100\xa0km  73\xa0mpg u2011imp   which is higher than the prius highway rating of 53\xa0mpg u2011us (4.4\xa0l 100\xa0km  64\xa0mpg u2011imp   81  as of march 2016 update   only three plug-in hybrid models available in the market have a higher combined fuel economy than the prius eco in terms of their combined ev mode hybrid fuel economy  the bmw i3 rex (88 mpg-e   the chevrolet volt (77 mpg-e   and first generation toyota prius plug-in hybrid (56 mpg-e   3   the fourth generation prius is 2.4\xa0in (6.1\xa0cm  longer  0.6\xa0in (1.5\xa0cm  wider and 0.8\xa0in (2.0\xa0cm  lower  at the rear a double wishbone independent suspension replaces its predecessors  torsion beam  the front uses standard led headlamps  toyota has claimed that it has a drag coefficient of xa0cd 0.24  better than the 0.25 claimed for the third-generation model  83  a tow hitch option is available in the uk for up to 725\xa0kg (1,600\xa0lb   84   the prius plug-in hybrid (zvw35  is based on the conventional third generation (zvw30  with a 4.4-kwh lithium-ion battery that allows an all-electric range of 23\xa0km (14.3\xa0mi   85  a global demonstration program involving 600 pre-production test cars began in late 2009 and took place in japan  europe  canada  china  australia  new zealand and the united states  86][87][88   the production version was unveiled at the september 2011 frankfurt motor show  85

during its first year in the market  global sales reached 27,181 prius phvs  making the prius phv the second top selling plug-in electric car in 2012 after the chevrolet volt  93  production of the first generation prius plug-in hybrid ended in june 2015.[94  as of april 2016 update   cumulative sales of the first generation prius phvs totaled 75,400 units delivered worldwide since 2012.[5][95  the united states led sales with 42,345 units delivered through september 2016,[96][97  followed by japan with 22,100 units  and europe with 10,600 units  both through january 2017.[11  by the end of 2016  the prius plug-in ranked as the world s all-time third top selling plug-in hybrid after the volt ampera family of vehicles  and the mitsubishi outlander p-hev  98   the second generation prius plug-in  called toyota prius prime in the u s  and prius phv in japan  99  was developed in parallel with the standard fourth generation prius model (xw50  released in december 2015.[100  the model was released to retail customers in the u s  in november 2016,[12  followed by japan in february 2017.[95  in the american market  unlike the first generation model  the prius prime will be available

warm the engine by pumping previously saved hot engine coolant from a coolant thermos 165  before the internal combustion engine is started  the delay between powering the car on and starting the internal combustion engine is approximately seven seconds  the third generation prius does not have a coolant thermos  instead  the engine is heated by recapturing exhaust heat  a button labelled  ev  maintains electric vehicle mode after being powered on and under most low-load conditions at less than 25\xa0mph (40\xa0km h   this permits driving with low noise and no fuel consumption for journeys

cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting  while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design   as the prius reached ten years of being available in the us market  in february 2011 consumer reports decided to look at the lifetime of the prius battery and the cost to replace it  the magazine tested a 2002 toyota prius with over 200,000 miles on it  and compared the results to the nearly identical 2001 prius with 2,000 miles tested by consumer reports 10 years before  the comparison showed little difference in performance when tested for fuel economy and acceleration  overall fuel economy of the 2001 model was 40.6 miles per us gallon (5.79\xa0l 100\xa0km  48.8\xa0mpg u2011imp  while the 2002 prius with high mileage delivered 40.4 miles per us gallon (5.82\xa0l 100\xa0km  48.5\xa0mpg u2011imp   the magazine concluded that the effectiveness of the battery has not degraded over the long run  171  the cost of replacing the first generation battery varies between us 2,200 and us 2,600 from a toyota dealer  but low-use units from salvage yards are available for around us 500.[171  one study indicates it may be worthwhile to rebuild batteries using good blades from defective used batteries  172   the hvac system uses an ac induction motor to drive a scroll compressor  using a scroll compressor increases the efficiency of the system  while driving it with an ac induction motor makes the system more flexible  so the ac can run while the engine is off  because the oil used with the gas also flows in the area of the motor-windings  it needs to be highly insulating  therefore  a special oil (nd11)[173  is used  the system cannot be maintained with equipment that is used to service regular cars  which mainly use pag oils  as the equipment would contaminate the nd11 oil with pag oil  according to sae j2843 the oil provided from maintenance equipment must contain less than 0.1  pag when filling  one percent pag

used by several car manufacturers for new cars  the prius 2nd generation became the first car to meet japan s new 2015 fuel economy standards measured under the jc08 test  182   in 2008  the british government and british media requested that toyota release detailed figures for the energy use and co2 emissions resulting from the building and disposal of the prius  toyota has not supplied the requested data to address statements that the lifetime energy usage of the prius  including the increased environmental cost of manufacture and disposal of the nickel-metal hydride battery  is outweighed by lower lifetime fuel consumption  189  toyota states that lifetime co2 saving is 43 percent  190  as of 2010 update   the uk government car service operated over 100 priuses  the largest part of its fleet  and lists the prius as having the lowest co2 emissions among its fleet  191   cnw marketing research initially published a study 192  in which they estimated that the total lifetime energy cost of a 2005 prius was greater than that of a hummer h2  the study has been widely debunked  see for example   hummer versus prius   dust to dust  report misleads the media and public with bad science   193   the prius uses electric motors in the hybrid propulsion systems  powered by a high voltage battery in the rear of the car  there has been some public concern over whether the levels of electromagnetic field exposure within the cabin are higher than comparable cars  and what health effects those fields may present  popularized by a 2008 the new york times article  194  however  toyota 194  and several independent studies 195][196  have indicated that aside from a brief spike when accelerating  the electromagnetic fields within the prius are no different from those of a conventional car and do not exceed the icnirp 197  exposure guidelines   a 2013 study by the mayo clinic found that patients with implanted cardiac devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators can safely drive or ride in hybrids or plug-in electric cars without risk of electromagnetic interference  emi   the research was conducted using implantable devices from the three major manufacturers and a 2012 toyota prius hybrid  the study used 30 participants with implanted devices  and measured electric and magnetic fields in six positions inside and outside the prius  and each position was evaluated at different speeds  198   the wall street journal reported in february 2007 on concerns that quiet cars like the prius may pose a safety risk to those who rely on engine noise to sense the presence or location of moving vehicles  199  blind pedestrians are a primary concern  and the national federation of the blind advocates audio emitters on hybrid vehicles  200  but it has been argued that increased risks may also affect sighted pedestrians or bicyclists who are accustomed to aural cues from vehicles  however  silent vehicles are already relatively common  and there is also a lack of aural cues from vehicles that have a conventional internal combustion engine where engine noise has been reduced by noise-absorbing materials in the engine bay and noise-canceling muffler systems  in july 2007  a spokesman for toyota said the company is aware of the issue and is studying options  201   in 2010  toyota released a device for the third-generation prius meant to alert pedestrians of its proximity  202  japan issued guidelines for such warning devices in january 2010 and the us approved legislation on december 2010.[203][204  models equipped with automatically activated systems

independent body charged with policing the rules of the advertising industry  ruled that a television advert for the toyota prius should not be broadcast again in the same form  having breached rules concerning misleading advertising  the advertisement stated that the prius  emits up to one tonne less co2 per year   while on-screen text included "1 tonne of co2 less than an equivalent family vehicle with a diesel engine  average calculated on 20,000 km a year   points of contention were the vehicles chosen for comparison  whether   up to  one tonne less  adequately communicated that reductions could be lower  and whether the distance used was appropriate  20,000\xa0km per year is around a us car s average annual driving distance  while a uk car s is 13,440\xa0km  207   the large number of prius-owning progressive celebrities in 2002 prompted the washington post to dub hybrids  hollywood s latest politically correct status symbol   208  conservatives called  prius patriots

american conservative commentator rush limbaugh opining that  these liberals think they re ahead of the game on these things  and they re just suckers   210   in july 2007 the new york times published an article using data from cnw marketing research finding that 57  of prius buyers said their main reason for buying was that  it makes a statement about me   while just 37  cited fuel economy as a prime motivator  211  shortly afterwards washington post columnist robert samuelson coined the term  prius politics  to describe a situation where the driver s desire to  show off  is a stronger motivator than the desire to curb greenhouse gas emissions  212  some conservatives promote use of the toyota prius and other hybrid cars  for example  jim road from what would jesus drive  encouraged people to drive hybrid cars because of the damage that large suvs and faster cars can do to others  213   former central intelligence agency  cia  chief r  james woolsey  jr  drives a prius because of its low fuel consumption  woolsey noted the volatility of the middle east  coupled with anti-us sentiment in much of the region  noting that the high percentage of oil drilled in the middle east gives vast profits to middle eastern regimes  woolsey believes that it is a patriotic obligation to drive more efficient vehicles  in a motor trend magazine article  woolsey stated that those oil profits find their way to terrorist groups like al-qaeda  meaning that americans who buy inefficient vehicles would  in effect  be indirectly funding terrorism   we re paying for both sides in this war  and that s not a good long-term strategy   said woolsey   i have a bumper sticker on the back of my prius that reads   bin laden hates this car    214   a driverless version of the prius was one of six cars to finish the 2007 darpa urban challenge  215   a racing version of the car took class pole position 216  and finished sixth at the 2012 fuji gt 500km  217   there have been a number of governments with incentives intended to encourage hybrid car sales  in some countries  including the us and canada  some rebate incentives have been exhausted  while other countries such as the united kingdom  sweden  belgium  and the netherlands have various or alternative incentives to purchasing a hybrid vehicle   several us companies offer employees incentives  bank of america will reimburse us
