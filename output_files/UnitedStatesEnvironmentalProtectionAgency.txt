UnitedStatesEnvironmentalProtectionAgency
 the united states environmental protection agency 2   epa or sometimes usepa  is an agency of the federal government of the united states which was created for the purpose of protecting human health and the environment by writing and enforcing regulations based on laws passed by congress  3  the epa was proposed by president richard nixon and began operation on december 2  1970  after nixon signed an executive order  the order establishing the epa was ratified by committee hearings in the house and senate  4  the agency is led by its administrator  who is appointed by the president and approved by congress  the current administrator is scott pruitt  5  the epa is not a cabinet department  but the administrator is normally given cabinet rank   the epa has its headquarters in washington  d c   regional offices for each of the agency s ten regions  and 27 laboratories  the agency conducts environmental assessment  research  and education  it has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws  in consultation with state  tribal  and local governments  it delegates some permitting  monitoring  and enforcement responsibility to u s  states and the federally recognized tribes  epa enforcement powers include fines  sanctions  and other measures  the agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts   in 2016  the agency had 15,376 full-time employees  1  more than half of epa s employees are engineers  scientists  and environmental protection specialists  other employees include legal  public affairs  financial  and information technologists   beginning in the late 1950s 6  and through the 1960s  congress reacted to increasing public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment  the resources and conservation act of 1959 was introduced by senator james e  murray in the 86th congress  in the years following  similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and congress s potential responses  in 1968  a joint house-senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the senate committee on interior and insular affairs senator henry m  jackson and the house committee on science and astronautics  representative george miller  to discuss the need for and means of implementing a national environmental policy  in the colloquium  some members of congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment  7   the national environmental policy act of 1969  nepa  42 u s c  \xa7\xa7 4321\u20134347).[8][better xa0source xa0needed  9  was modeled on rca  10  that bill would have established an council on environmental quality in the office of the president  declared a national environmental policy  and required the preparation of an annual environmental report  11][better xa0source xa0needed  nepa was declared  12  and president nixon signed it into law on january 1  1970  nepa created a council on environmental quality  ceq  in the executive office of the president  citation needed  nepa required that a detailed statement of environmental impacts be prepared for all major federal actions significantly affecting the environment  the  detailed statement  would ultimately be referred to as an environmental impact statement  eis    in 1970  president richard nixon proposed an executive reorganization that consolidated many environmental responsibilities of the federal government under one agency  a new environmental protection agency  house and senate reviewed and passed the proposal  13   staff recall that in the early days there was  an enormous sense of purpose and excitement  and the expectation that \u201cthere was this agency which was going to do something about a problem that clearly was on the minds of a lot of people in this country  u201d leading to tens of thousands of resumes from those eager to participate in the mighty effort to clean up america u2019s environment  14   when epa first began  the private sector felt strongly that the environmental protection movement was a passing fad  and the agency u2019s first administrator  william ruckelshaus  felt pressure to show a public which was deeply skeptical about government u2019s effectiveness  that epa could respond effectively to widespread concerns about pollution  15   the epa began regulating greenhouse gases  ghgs  from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the clean air act  caa  for the first time on january 2  2011  standards for mobile sources have been established pursuant to section 202 of the caa  and ghgs from stationary sources are controlled under the authority of part c of title i of the act per regulation of greenhouse gases under the clean air act   in may 2013  congress renamed the epa headquarters as the william jefferson clinton federal building  after former president bill clinton  16  relevant  \u2013 discuss   the epa is led by an administrator of the environmental protection agency  as of 2017 update  scott pruitt is the 14th administrator   creating 10 epa regions was an initiative that came from president richard nixon  32   each epa regional office is responsible within its states for implementing the agency s programs  except those programs that have been specifically delegated to states   each regional office also implements programs on indian tribal lands  except those programs delegated to tribal authorities   the laws below are general environmental protection measures  and may also apply to other units of the government  including the department of the interior and the department of agriculture   it is worth noting that  in looking back in 2013 on the agency he helped shape from the beginning  administrator william ruckelshaus observed that a danger for epa was that air  water  waste and other programs would be unconnected  placed in \u201csilos  u201d a problem that persists more than 50 years later  albeit less so than at the start  34   the epa safer choice label  previously known as the design for the environment  dfe  label  helps consumers and commercial buyers identify and select products with safer chemical ingredients  without sacrificing quality or performance  when a product has the safer choice label  it means that every intentionally-added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by epa scientists  only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the safer choice label   through the safer detergents stewardship initiative (sdsi   35  epa s design for the environment  dfe  recognizes environmental leaders who voluntarily commit to the use of safer surfactants  safer surfactants are the ones that break down quickly to non-polluting compounds and help protect aquatic life in both fresh and salt water  nonylphenol ethoxylates  commonly referred to as npes  are an example of a surfactant class that does not meet the definition of a safer surfactant   the design for the environment  which was renamed to epa safer choice in 2015  has identified safer alternative surfactants through partnerships with industry and environmental advocates  these safer alternatives are comparable in cost and are readily available  cleangredients 36  is a source of safer surfactants   in 1992 the epa launched the energy star program  a voluntary program that fosters energy efficiency  as of 2006  more than 40,000 energy star products were available including major appliances  office equipment  lighting  home electronics  and more  in addition  the label can also be found on new homes and commercial and industrial buildings  in 2006  about 12 percent of new housing in the united states was labeled energy star  37   the epa estimates it saved about $14 billion in energy costs in 2006 alone  the energy star program has helped spread the use of led traffic lights  efficient fluorescent lighting  power management systems for office equipment  and low standby energy use  38   epa s smart growth program began in 1998  is to help communities improve their development practices and get the type of development they want  together with local  state  and national experts epa encourage development strategies that protect human health and the environment  create economic opportunities  and provide attractive and affordable neighborhoods for people of all income levels  39   epa administers the federal insecticide  fungicide  and rodenticide act  fifra   which is much older than the agency  and registers all pesticides legally sold in the united states   manufacturers selling automobiles in the united states are required to provide epa fuel economy test results for their vehicles and the manufacturers are not allowed to provide results from alternate sources  citation needed  the fuel economy is calculated using the emissions data collected during two of the vehicle s clean air act certification tests by measuring the total volume of carbon captured from the exhaust during the tests  citation needed   the testing system was originally developed in 1972 and used driving cycles designed to simulate driving during rush-hour in los angeles during that era  until 1984 the epa reported the exact fuel economy figures calculated from the test  citation needed  in 1984  the epa began adjusting city  aka urban dynamometer driving schedule or udds  results downward by 10  and highway  aka highway fuel economy test or hwfet  results by 22  to compensate for changes in driving conditions since 1972  and to better correlate the epa test results with real-world driving  in 1996  the epa proposed updating the federal testing procedures 40  to add a new higher-speed test (us06  and an air-conditioner-on test (sc03  to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with real-world reports  in december 2006 the updated testing methodology was finalized to be implemented in model year 2008 vehicles and set the precedent of a 12-year review cycle for the test procedures  41   in february 2005  epa launched a program called  your mpg  that allows drivers to add real-world fuel economy statistics into a database on the epa s fuel economy website and compare them with others and with the original epa test results  42   the epa conducts fuel economy tests on very few vehicles   just 18 of the epa s 17,000 employees work in the automobile-testing department in ann arbor  michigan  examining 200 to 250 vehicles a year  or roughly 15 percent of new models  as to that other 85 percent  the epa takes automakers at their word u2014without any testing-accepting submitted results as accurate   43  two-thirds of the vehicles the epa tests themselves are randomly selected and the remaining third is tested for specific reasons   although originally created as a reference point for fossil-fueled vehicles  driving cycles have been used for estimating how many miles an electric vehicle will get on a single charge  44   the air quality modeling group  aqmg  is in the epa s office of air and radiation  oar  and leads in the full range of air quality models  atmospheric dispersion modeling and other mathematical simulation techniques used in assessing the impacts of air pollution sources and control strategies  it serves other epa headquarters staff  epa regional offices  and state and local environmental agencies  coordinates with the epa s office of research and development on the development of new models and techniques  and wider issues of atmospheric research and conducts modeling analyses to support policy and regulatory decisions of the epa s office of air quality planning and standards  oaqps   it is located in research triangle park  north carolina  controlling air pollution helps diminish the risk of pollution-related diseases   epa u2019s oil spill prevention program includes the spill prevention  control  and countermeasure  spcc  and the facility response plan  frp  rules  the spcc rule applies to all facilities that store  handle  process  gather  transfer  refine  distribute  use or consume oil or oil products  oil products includes petroleum and non-petroleum oils as well as  animal fats  oils and greases  fish and marine mammal oils  and vegetable oils  it mandates a written plan for facilities that store more than 1,320 gallons of fuel above ground or more than 42,000 gallons below-ground  and which might discharge to navigable waters  as defined in the clean water act  or adjoining shorelines  secondary spill containment is mandated at oil storage facilities and oil release containment is required at oil development sites  45   the toxics release inventory  tri  is a resource for learning about toxic chemical releases and pollution prevention activities reported by industrial and federal facilities  tri data support informed decision-making by communities  government agencies  companies  and others  46   watersense is an epa program launched in june 2006 to encourage water efficiency in the united states through the use of a special label on consumer products  47  products include high-efficiency toilets  hets   bathroom sink faucets  and accessories   and irrigation equipment  watersense is a voluntary program  with epa developing specifications for water-efficient products through a public process and product testing by independent laboratories  48   epa ensures safe drinking water for the public  by setting standards for more than 160,000 public water systems nationwide  epa oversees states  local governments and water suppliers to enforce the standards under the safe drinking water act  the program includes regulation of injection wells in order to protect underground sources of drinking water  select readings of amounts of certain contaminants in drinking water  precipitation  and surface water  in addition to milk and air  are reported on epa s rad net web site 49  in a section entitled envirofacts  50  despite mandatory reporting certain readings exceeding epa mcl levels may be deleted or not included  51][52  in 2013  an epa draft revision relaxed regulations for radiation exposure through drinking water  stating that current standards are impractical to enforce  the epa recommended that intervention was not necessary until drinking water was contaminated with radioactive iodine 131 at a concentration of 81,000 picocuries per liter  the limit for short term exposure set by the international atomic energy agency   which was 27,000 times the prior epa limit of 3 picocuries per liter for long term exposure  53   the national pollutant discharge elimination system  npdes  permit program addresses water pollution by regulating point sources which discharge pollutants to us waters  created in 1972 by the clean water act  the npdes permit program is authorized to state governments to perform its many permitting  administrative  and enforcement aspects  54   epa has the following seven project groups to protect the public from radiation  55   epa s indoor air quality tools for schools program helps schools to maintain a healthy environment and reduce exposures to indoor environmental contaminants  it helps school personnel identify  solve  and prevent indoor air quality problems in the school environment  through the use of a multi-step management plan and checklists for the entire building  schools can lower their students  and staff s risk of exposure to asthma triggers  63   the national environmental education act of 1990 requires epa to provide national leadership to increase environmental literacy  epa established the office of environmental education to implement this program  64   epa is responsible for reviewing environmental impact statements of other federal agencies  projects  under the national environmental policy act  nepa    clean school bus usa is a national partnership to reduce children s exposure to diesel exhaust by eliminating unnecessary school bus idling  installing effective emission control systems on newer buses and replacing the oldest buses in the fleet with newer ones  its goal is to reduce both children s exposure to diesel exhaust and the amount of air pollution created by diesel school buses  65   the epa has been criticized for its lack of progress towards environmental justice  administrator christine todd whitman was criticized for her changes to president bill clinton s executive order 12898 during 2001  removing the requirements for government agencies to take the poor and minority populations into special consideration when making changes to environmental legislation  and therefore defeating the spirit of the executive order  66  in a march 2004 report  the inspector general of the agency concluded that the epa  has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan  and has not established values  goals  expectations  and performance measurements  for environmental justice in its daily operations  another report in september 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs  policies and activities towards environmental justice  67  studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the epa s superfund program  and that this situation was worsening  66   many environmental justice issues are localized  and therefore difficult to address by a federal agency  such as the epa  without strong media attention  political interest  or  crisis  status  local issues are less likely to be addressed at the federal level compared to larger  well publicized incidents   conflicting political powers in successive administrations  the white house maintains direct control over the epa  and its enforcements are subject to the political agenda of who is in power  republicans and democrats differ in their approaches to environmental justice  while president bill clinton signed the executive order 12898  the bush administration did not develop a clear plan or establish goals for integrating environmental justice into everyday practices  affecting the motivation for environmental enforcement  68][page xa0needed   the epa is responsible for preventing and detecting environmental crimes  informing the public of environmental enforcement  and setting and monitoring standards of air pollution  water pollution  hazardous wastes and chemicals   it is difficult to construct a specific mission statement given its wide range of responsibilities   69][page xa0needed  it is impossible to address every environmental crime adequately or efficiently if there is no specific mission statement to refer to  the epa answers to various groups  competes for resources  and confronts a wide array of harms to the environment  all of these present challenges  including a lack of resources  its self-policing policy  and a broadly defined legislation that creates too much discretion for epa officers  70][page xa0needed   the epa  does not have the authority or resources to address injustices without an increase in federal mandates  requiring private industries to consider the environmental ramifications of their activities  71   on march 3  2004  the united states navy transferred usns bold  a stalwart class ocean surveillance ship  to the epa  now known as osv bold  the ship  previously used in anti-submarine operations during the cold war  is equipped with sidescan sonar  underwater video  water and sediment sampling instruments  used in study of ocean and coastline  one of the major missions of the bold was to monitor for ecological impact sites where materials are dumped from dredging operations in u s  ports  72  in 2013  the bold was awarded to seattle central community college  sccc  by the general services administration  sccc demonstrated in a competition that they would put it to the highest and best purpose  and acquired the ship at a cost of $5,000.[73   advance identification  or adid  is a planning process used by the epa to identify wetlands and other bodies of water and their respective suitability for the discharge of dredged and fill material  the epa conducts the process in cooperation with the u s  army corps of engineers and local states or native american tribes  as of february 1993  38 adid projects had been completed and 33 were ongoing  74   in the latest center for effective government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most freedom of information act foia requests  published in 2015  using 2012 and 2013 data  the most recent years available   the epa earned a d by scoring 67 out of a possible 100 points  i e  did not earn a satisfactory overall grade  75   in 1982 congress charged that the epa had mishandled the $1.6 billion program to clean up hazardous waste dumps superfund and demanded records from epa director anne m  gorsuch  she refused and became the first agency director in u s  history to be cited for contempt of congress  the epa turned the documents over to congress several months later  after the white house abandoned its court claim that the documents could not be subpoened by congress because they were covered by executive privilege  at that point  gorsuch resigned her post  citing pressures caused by the media and the congressional investigation  76  critics charged that the epa was in a shambles at that time  77   gorsuch  appointed by ronald reagan  resigned under fire in 1983  gorsuch based her administration of the epa on the new federalism approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states  78  she believed that the epa was over-regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost-effective  during her 22 months as agency head  she cut the budget of the epa by 22   reduced the number of cases filed against polluters  relaxed clean air act regulations  and facilitated the spraying of restricted-use pesticides  she cut the total number of agency employees  and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating  79  environmentalists contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters  and accused her of trying to dismantle the agency  80     in april 2008  the union of concerned scientists said that more than half of the nearly 1,600 epa staff scientists who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported they had experienced incidents of political interference in their work  the survey included chemists  toxicologists  engineers  geologists and experts in other fields of science  about 40  of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five years than in previous years  the highest number of complaints came from scientists who were involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of everyday life  81   epa research has also been suppressed by career managers  82  supervisors at epa s national center for environmental assessment required several paragraphs to be deleted from a peer-reviewed journal article about epa s integrated risk information system  which led two co-authors to have their names removed from the publication  and the corresponding author  ching-hung hsu  to leave epa  because of the draconian restrictions placed on publishing   83  epa subjects employees who author scientific papers to prior restraint  even if those papers are written on personal time  84   epa employees have reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on hydraulic fracturing due to industry 85][86][87  and governmental pressure  and are concerned about the censorship of environmental reports  85][88][89   in 2015  the government accountability office stated that the epa violated federal law with covert propaganda on their social media platforms  the social media messaging that was used promoted materials supporting the waters of the united states rule  including materials that were designed to oppose legislative efforts to limit or block the rule  90   in 2005  the epa issued the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule (lt2   which requires covering open-air reservoirs containing finished drinking water  in order to reduce the incidence of disease caused by microorganisms in drinking water  91   to comply with the rule the epa ordered that a cap be placed over the hillview reservoir  where water bound for new york city receives its final disinfection before entering the pipelines serving the city  92  a number of city and state officials complained that the project was too costly and unnecessary  93   in july 2005  an epa report showing that auto companies were using loopholes to produce less fuel-efficient cars was delayed  the report was supposed to be released the day before a controversial energy bill was passed and would have provided backup for those opposed to it  but the epa delayed its release at the last minute .[94   in 2007  the state of california sued the epa for its refusal to allow california and 16 other states to raise fuel economy standards for new cars  95  epa administrator stephen l  johnson claimed that the epa was working on its own standards  but the move has been widely considered an attempt to shield the auto industry from environmental regulation by setting lower standards at the federal level  which would then preempt state laws  96][97][98  california governor arnold schwarzenegger  along with governors from 13 other states  stated that the epa s actions ignored federal law  and that existing california standards  adopted by many states in addition to california  were almost twice as effective as the proposed federal standards  99  it was reported that stephen johnson ignored his own staff in making this decision  100   after the federal government had bailed out general motors and chrysler in the automotive industry crisis of 2008\u20132010  the 2010 chevrolet equinox was released with an epa fuel economy rating abnormally higher than its competitors  independent road tests 101][102][103][104  found that the vehicle did not out-perform its competitors  which had much lower fuel economy ratings  later road tests found better  but inconclusive  results  105][106   in march 2005  nine states  california  new york  new jersey  new hampshire  massachusetts  maine  connecticut  new mexico and vermont  sued the epa  the epa s inspector general had determined that the epa s regulation of mercury emissions did not follow the clean air act  and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees  107][108  the epa had suppressed a study it commissioned by harvard university which contradicted its position on mercury controls  109  the suit alleged that the epa s rule exempting coal-fired power plants from  maximum available control technology  was illegal  and additionally charged that the epa s system of cap-and-trade to lower average mercury levels would allow power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions  which they objected would lead to dangerous local hotspots of mercury contamination even if average levels declined  110  several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations  illinois s proposed rule would have reduced mercury emissions from power plants by an average of 90  by 2009.[111  in 2008\u2014by which point a total of fourteen states had joined the suit u2014the u s  court of appeals for the district of columbia ruled that the epa regulations violated the clean air act  112   in response  epa announced plans to propose such standards to replace the vacated clean air mercury rule  and did so on march 16  2011.[113   in december 2007  epa administrator stephen l  johnson approved a draft of a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfare u2014a decision that would trigger the first national mandatory global-warming regulations  associate deputy administrator jason burnett e-mailed the draft to the white house  white house aides u2014who had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate change u2014knew the gist of what johnson s finding would be  burnett said  they also knew that once they opened the attachment  it would become a public record  making it controversial and difficult to rescind  so they did not open it  rather  they called johnson and asked him to take back the draft  johnson rescinded the draft  in july 2008  he issued a new version which did not state that global warming was danger to public welfare  burnett resigned in protest  114   a $3 million mapping study on sea level rise was suppressed by epa management during both the bush and obama administrations  and managers changed a key interagency report to reflect the removal of the maps  115   on august 5  2015  while examining the level of pollutants in the gold king mine  116  epa contractors released over three million gallons of toxic waste water  including heavy metals such as lead and arsenic into cement creek  which flowed into the animas river in colorado  117   since taking office january 2017  donald trump has sought to reduce epa employees xb4 amount of public interaction via social media  118   the president has    barred  epa employees  from awarding new contracts or grants as well   [119   some career environmental regulators who conceded that they remained worried about what president trump might do on policy matters u2014said such orders were not much different from those delivered by the obama administration as it shifted policies from the departing white house of george w  bush   120  the associated press quoted employees as saying this was unusual  trump has targeted 30 environmental rules for delayed implementation   including updated pollution rulings for several states  renewable fuel standards and limits on the amount of formaldehyde that can leach from wood products   121   in february 2017  u s  representative matt gaetz of florida sponsored a bill  122  to abolish the epa by 2018  according to gaetz   the american people are drowning in rules and regulation promulgated by unelected bureaucrats  and the environmental protection agency has become an extraordinary offender   the bill was co-sponsored by thomas massie  r-ky    steven palazzo  r-ms   and barry loudermilk (r-ga    123
