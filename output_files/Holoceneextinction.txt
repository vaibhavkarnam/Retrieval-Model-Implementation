Holoceneextinction
 the holocene extinction  otherwise referred to as the sixth extinction or anthropocene extinction  is the ongoing extinction event of species during the present holocene epoch mainly due to human activity  the large number of extinctions span numerous families of plants and animals including mammals  birds  amphibians  reptiles and arthropods  with widespread degradation of highly biodiverse habitats such as coral reefs and rainforest  as well as other areas  the vast majority are thought to be undocumented  according to the species-area theory and based on upper-bound estimating  the present rate of extinction may be up to 140,000 species per year  making it the greatest loss of biodiversity since the cretaceous u2013paleogene extinction event   the holocene extinction includes the disappearance of large land animals known as megafauna  starting at the end of the last ice age  megafauna outside of the african continent  which did not evolve alongside humans  proved highly sensitive to the introduction of new predation  and many died out shortly after early humans began spreading and hunting across the earth  additionally  many african species have also gone extinct in the holocene   these extinctions  occurring near the pleistocene u2013holocene boundary  are sometimes referred to as the quaternary extinction event   the arrival of humans on different continents coincide with megafaunal extinction  the most popular theory is that human overhunting species added to existing stress conditions  although there is debate on how much human predation affected their decline  certain population declines have been directly correlated with human activity  such as the extinction events of new zealand and hawaii  aside from humans  climate change may have been a driving factor in the megafaunal extinctions  especially at the end of the quaternary   the ecology of humanity has been noted as being that of an unprecedented  global superpredator  that regularly preys on the adults of other apex predators and has worldwide effects on food webs  extinctions of species have occurred on every land mass and ocean  with many famous examples within africa  asia  europe  australia  north and south america  and on smaller islands  overall  the holocene extinction can be characterized by the human impact on the environment  the holocene extinction continues into the 21st century  with meat consumption  overfishing  ocean acidification and the amphibian crisis being a few broader examples of an almost universal  cosmopolitan decline in biodiversity  a ballooning human population along with profligate consumption are considered to be the primary drivers of this rapid decline       the holocene extinction is also known as the  sixth extinction   due to it being the sixth mass extinct event  after the ordovician u2013silurian extinction events  the late devonian extinction  the permian u2013triassic extinction event  the triassic u2013jurassic extinction event  and the cretaceous u2013paleogene extinction event  1][2][3][4  there is no general agreement on where the holocene  or anthropogenic  extinction begins  and the quaternary extinction event  which includes climate change resulting in the end of the last ice age  ends  or if they should be considered separate events at all  5][6  some have suggested that anthropogenic extinctions may have begun as early as when the first modern humans spread out of africa between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago  which is supported by rapid megafaunal extinction following recent human colonisation in australia  new zealand and madagascar  1  in a similar way that any large  adaptable predator moving into a new ecosystem would  in many cases  it is suggested even minimal hunting pressure was enough to wipe out large fauna  particularly on geographically isolated islands  7][8  only during the most recent parts of the extinction have plants also suffered large losses  9   in the future of life (2002   e o  wilson of harvard calculated that  if the current rate of human disruption of the biosphere continues  one-half of earth s higher lifeforms will be extinct by 2100  a 1998 poll conducted by the american museum of natural history found that seventy percent of biologists acknowledge the existence of the anthropogenic extinction  10  numerous scientific studies \u2014 such as a 2004 report published in nature  11  and papers authored by the iucn s annual red list of threatened species \u2014 have since reinforced this conviction  at present  the rate of extinction of species is estimated at 100 to 1,000 times higher than the  base  or historically typical rate of extinction  in terms of the natural evolution of the planet  12][13  and also the current rate of extinction is  therefore  10 to 100 times higher than any of the previous mass extinctions in the history of earth  it is also the only known mass extinction of plants  citation needed  one scientist estimates the current extinction rate may be 10,000 times the background extinction rate  nevertheless  most scientists predict a much lower extinction rate than this outlying estimate  14  stuart pimm stated  the current rate of species extinction is about 100 times the natural rate  for plants  15  mass extinctions are characterized by the loss of at least 75  of species within a geologically short period of time  16][17][18   in a pair of studies published in 2015  extrapolation from observed extinction of hawaiian snails led to the conclusion that 7  of all species on earth may have been lost already  19   the abundance of species extinctions considered anthropogenic  or due to human activity  have sometimes  especially when referring to hypothesized future events  been collectively called the  anthropocene extinction   20][21][22   anthropocene  is a term introduced in 2000  it is now posited by some that a new geological epoch has begun  characterised by the most abrupt and widespread extinction of species since the cretaceous u2013paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago  1   the term  anthropocene  is used by few scientists  and some commentators may refer to the current and projected future extinctions as part of a longer holocene extinction  23][24  the holocene u2013anthropocene boundary is contested  with some commentators asserting significant human influence on climate for much of what is normally regarded as the holocene epoch  25  other commentators place the holocene u2013anthropocene boundary at the industrial revolution while also saying that    f ormal adoption of this term in the near future will largely depend on its utility  particularly to earth scientists working on late holocene successions    it has been suggested that human activity has made the period following the mid-20th century different enough from the rest of the holocene to consider it a new geological epoch  known as the anthropocene  26  which was considered for implementation into the timeline of earth s history by the international commission on stratigraphy in 2016.[27][28  in order to constitute the holocene as an extinction event  scientists must determine exactly when anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions began to measurably alter natural atmospheric levels at a global scale and when these alterations caused changes to global climate  employing chemical proxies from antarctic ice cores  researchers have estimated the fluctuations of carbon dioxide (co2  and methane gases (ch4  in the earth u2019s atmosphere for the late pleistocene and holocene epochs  25  based on studies that estimated fluctuations of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere using chemical proxies from antarctic ice cores  general argumentation of when the peak of the anthropocene occurred pertains to the timeframe within the previous two centuries  typically beginning with the industrial revolution  when greenhouse gas levels were recorded by contemporary methods at its highest  29][30   the holocene extinction is mainly caused by human activity  2][3][22][4  extinction of animals  plants  and other organisms caused by human actions may go as far back as the late pleistocene  over 12,000 years ago  31  there is a correlation between megafaunal extinction and the arrival of humans  and human population growth  most prominently in the past two centuries  is regarded as one of the underlying causes of extinction  2][32][33][34   megafauna was once found on every continent of the world and large islands such as new zealand and madagascar  but is now almost exclusively found on the continent of africa  with notable comparisons on australia and the islands previously mentioned experiences population crashes and trophic cascades shortly after the earliest human settlers  7][8  it has been suggested that the african megafauna survived as they evolved alongside humans  1  the timing of south american megafaunal extinction does not appear to correspond to human arrival  although the possibility of whether human activity at the time may have impacted the global climate enough to cause such an extinction has been suggested  1  it has been noted  in the face of such evidence  humans are unique in ecology as an unprecedented  global superpredator   regularly preying on large numbers of fully grown terrestrial and marine apex predators  and with a great deal of influence over food webs and climatic systems worldwide  35  although significant debate exists as to how much human predation and indirect effects contributed to prehistoric extinctions  certain population crashes have been directly correlated with human arrival  6][1][31   human civilization flourished in accordance to the efficiency and intensification of prevailing subsistence systems  36  local communities that acquire more subsistence strategies increased in number to combat competitive pressures of land utilization  25][36  therefore  the holocene developed competition on the basis of agriculture  the growth of agriculture has then introduced newer means of climate change  pollution  and ecological development  37   habitat destruction by humans  including oceanic devastation  such as through overfishing and contamination  and the modification and destruction of vast tracts of land and river systems around the world to meet solely human-centered ends  with 13 percent of earth s ice-free land surface now used as row-crop agricultural sites  26 percent used as pastures  and 4 percent urban-industrial areas 39    thus replacing the original local ecosystems  40  other  related human causes of the extinction event include deforestation  hunting  pollution  41  the introduction in various regions of non-native species  and the widespread transmission of infectious diseases spread through livestock and crops  13   recent investigations about hunter-gatherer landscape burning has a major implication for the current debate about the timing of the anthropocene and the role that humans may have played in the production of greenhouse gases prior to the industrial revolution  36  studies on early hunter-gatherers raises questions about the current use of population size or density as a proxy for the amount of land clearance and anthropogenic burning that took place in pre-industrial times  42][43  scientists have questioned the correlation between population size and early territorial alterations  43  ruddiman and ellis  research paper in 2009 makes the case that early farmers involved in systems of agriculture used more land per capita than growers later in the holocene  who intensified their labor to produce more food per unit of area  thus  per laborer   arguing that agricultural involvement in rice production implemented thousands of years ago by relatively small populations have created significant environmental impacts through large-scale means of deforestation  36   while a number of human-derived factors are recognized as potentially contributing to rising atmospheric concentrations of ch4 and co2  deforestation and territorial clearance practices associated with agricultural development may be contributing most to these concentrations globally  29][44][36  scientists that are employing a variance of archaeological and paleoecological data argue that the processes contributing to substantial human modification of the environment spanned many thousands of years ago on a global scale and thus  not originating as early as the industrial revolution  gaining popularity on his uncommon hypothesis  palaeoclimatologist william ruddiman in 2003  stipulated that in the early holocene 11,000 years ago  atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane levels has fluctuated in a pattern which was different from the pleistocene epoch before it  25][42][44  he argued that the patterns of the significant decline of co2 levels during the last ice age of the pleistocene inversely correlates to the holocene where there has been dramatic increases of co2 around 8000 years ago and ch4 levels 3000 years after that  44  the correlation between the decrease of co2 in the pleistocene and the increase of it during the holocene implies that the causation of this spark of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere was the growth of human agriculture during the holocene such as the anthropogenic expansion of  human  land use and irrigation  25][44   human arrival in the caribbean around 6,000 years ago is correlated with the extinction of many species  45  examples include many different genera of ground and arboreal sloths across all islands  these sloths were generally smaller than those found on the south american continent  megalocnus were the largest genus at up to 90 kilograms (200\xa0lb   acratocnus were medium-sized relatives of modern two-toed sloths endemic to cuba  imagocnus also of cuba  neocnus and many others  46   recent research  based on archaeological and paleontological digs on 70 different pacific islands has shown that numerous species became extinct as people moved across the pacific  starting 30,000 years ago in the bismarck archipelago and solomon islands  47  it is currently estimated that among the bird species of the pacific  some 2000 species have gone extinct since the arrival of humans  representing a 20  drop in the biodiversity of birds worldwide  48   the first settlers are thought to have arrived in the islands between 300 and 800 ce  with european arrival in the 16th century  hawaii is notable for its endemism of plants  birds  insects  mollusks and fish  30  of its organisms are endemic  many of its species are endangered or have gone extinct  primarily due to accidentally introduced species and livestock grazing  over 40  of its bird species have gone extinct  and it is the location of 75  of extinctions in the united states  49  extinction has increased in hawaii over the last 200 years and is relatively well documented  with extinctions among native snails used as estimates for global extinction rates  19   australia was once home to a large assemblage of megafauna  with many parallels to those found on the african continent today  australia s fauna is characterised by primarily marsupial mammals  and many reptiles and birds  all existing as giant forms until recently  humans arrived on the continent very early  about 50,000 years ago  1  the extent human arrival contributed is controversial  climatic drying of australia 40,000\u201360,000 years ago was an unlikely cause  as it was less severe in speed or magnitude than previous regional climate change which failed to kill off megafauna  extinctions in australia continued from original settlement until today in both plants and animals  whilst many more animals and plants have declined or are endangered  citation needed   due to the older timeframe and the soil chemistry on the continent  very little subfossil preservation evidence exists relative to elsewhere  51  however  continent-wide extinction of all genera weighing over 100 kilograms  and six of seven genera weighing between 45 and 100 kilograms occurred around 46,400 years ago (4,000 years after human arrival  52  and the fact that megafauna survived until a later date on the island of tasmania following the establishment of a land bridge 53  suggest direct hunting or anthropogenic ecosystem disruption such as fire-stick farming as likely causes  the first evidence of direct human predation leading to extinction in australia was published in 2016.[50   within 500 years of the arrival of humans between 2,500\u20132,000 years ago  nearly all of madagascar s distinct  endemic and geographically isolated megafauna became extinct  54  the largest animals  of more than 150 kilograms (330\xa0lb   were extinct very shortly after the first human arrival  with large and medium-sized species dying out after prolonged hunting pressure from an expanding human population moving into more remote regions of the island around 1000 years ago  smaller fauna experienced initial increases due to decreased competition  and then subsequent declines over the last 500 years  8  all fauna weighing over 10 kilograms (22\xa0lb  died out  the primary reasons for this are human hunting and habitat loss from early aridification  both of which persist and threaten madagascar s remaining taxa today  citation needed   the eight or more species of elephant birds  giant flightless ratites in the genera aepyornis and mullerornis  are extinct from over-hunting  55  as well as 17 species of lemur  known as giant  subfossil lemurs  some of these lemurs typically weighed over 150 kilograms (330\xa0lb   and fossils have provided evidence of human butchery on many species  56   new zealand is characterised by its geographic isolation and island biogeography  and had been isolated from mainland australia for 80 million years  it was the last large land mass to be colonised by humans  the arrival of polynesian settlers circa 12th century resulted in the extinction of all of the islands  megafaunal birds within several hundred years  57  the last moa  large flightless ratites  became extinct within 200 years of the arrival of human settlers  7  the polynesians also introduced the polynesian rat  this may have put some pressure on other birds but at the time of early european contact (18th century  and colonisation (19th century  the bird life was prolific  with them  the europeans brought ship rats  possums  cats and mustelids which decimated native bird life  some of which had adapted flightlessness and ground nesting habits and others had no defensive behavior as a result of having no extant endemic mammalian predators  the kakapo  the world s biggest parrot  which is flightless  now only exists in managed breeding sanctuaries and nz s national emblem  the kiwi  is on the endangered bird list  57   there has been a debate as to the extent to which the disappearance of megafauna at the end of the last glacial period can be attributed to human activities by hunting  or even by slaughter 58  of prey populations  discoveries at monte verde in south america and at meadowcroft rock shelter in pennsylvania have caused a controversy 59  regarding the clovis culture  there likely would have been human settlements prior to the clovis culture  and the history of humans in the americas may extend back many thousands of years before the clovis culture  59  the amount of correlation between human arrival and megafauna extinction is still being debated  for example  in wrangel island in siberia the extinction of dwarf woolly mammoths  approximately 2000 bce  60  did not coincide with the arrival of humans  nor did megafaunal mass extinction on the south american continent  although it has been suggested climate changes induced by anthropogenic effects elsewhere in the world may have contributed  1   comparisons are sometimes made between recent extinctions  approximately since the industrial revolution  and the pleistocene extinction near the end of the last glacial period  the latter is exemplified by the extinction of large herbivores such as the woolly mammoth and the carnivores that preyed on them  humans of this era actively hunted the mammoth and the mastodon 61  but it is not known if this hunting was the cause of the subsequent massive ecological changes  widespread extinctions and climate changes  5][6   the ecosystems encountered by the first americans had not been exposed to human interaction  and may have been far less resilient to human made changes than the ecosystems encountered by industrial era humans  therefore  the actions of the clovis people  despite seeming insignificant by today s standards could indeed have had a profound effect on the ecosystems and wild life which was entirely unused to human influence  1   africa experienced the smallest decline in megafauna compared to the other continents  this is presumably due to the idea that afroeurasian megafauna evolved alongside humans  and thus developed a healthy fear of them  unlike the comparatively tame animals of other continents  62  unlike other continents  the megafauna of eurasia went extinct over a relatively long period of time  possibly due to climate fluctuations fragmenting and decreasing populations  leaving them vulnerable to over-exploitation  as with the steppe bison  bison priscus   63  the warming of the arctic region caused the rapid decline of grasslands  which had a negative effect on the grazing megafauna of eurasia  most of what once was mammoth steppe has been converted to mire  rendering the environment incapable of supporting them  notably the woolly mammoth  64   one of the main theories to the extinction is climate change  the climate change theory has suggested that a change in climate near the end of the late pleistocene stressed the megafauna to the point of extinction  23][66  some scientists favor abrupt climate change as the catalyst for the extinction of the mega-fauna at the end of the pleistocene  but there are many who believe increased hunting from early modern humans also played a part  with others even suggesting that the two interacted  1][67][68  however  the annual mean temperature of the current interglacial period for the last 10,000 years is no higher than that of previous interglacial periods  yet some of the same megafauna survived similar temperature increases  69][70][71][72][73][74  in the americas  a controversial explanation for the shift in climate is presented under the younger dryas impact hypothesis  which states that the impact of comets cooled global temperatures  75][76][77   megafauna play a significant role in the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem  tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance  they do so by their movement between the time they consume the nutrient and the time they release it through elimination  or  to a much lesser extent  through decomposition after death   78  in south america s amazon basin  it is estimated that such lateral diffusion was reduced over 98  following the megafaunal extinctions that occurred roughly 12,500 years ago  79][80  given that phosphorus availability is thought to limit productivity in much of the region  the decrease in its transport from the western part of the basin and from floodplains  both of which derive their supply from the uplift of the andes  to other areas is thought to have significantly impacted the region s ecology  and the effects may not yet have reached their limits  80  the extinction of the mammoths allowed grasslands they had maintained through grazing habits to become birch forests  5  the new forest and the resulting forest fires may have induced climate change  5  such disappearances might be the result of the proliferation of modern humans  31   large populations of megaherbivores have the potential to contribute greatly to the atmospheric concentration of methane  which is an important greenhouse gas  modern ruminant herbivores produce methane as a byproduct of foregut fermentation in digestion  and release it through belching or flatulence  today  around 20  of annual methane emissions come from livestock methane release  in the mesozoic  it has been estimated that sauropods could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually  81  contributing to the warmer climate of the time  up to 10\xa0\xb0c warmer than at present   81][82  this large emission follows from the enormous estimated biomass of sauropods  and because methane production of individual herbivores is believed to be almost proportional to their mass  81   recent studies have indicated that the extinction of megafaunal herbivores may have caused a reduction in atmospheric methane  this hypothesis is relatively new  83  one study examined the methane emissions from the bison that occupied the great plains of north america before contact with european settlers  the study estimated that the removal of the bison caused a decrease of as much as 2.2 million tons per year  84  another study examined the change in the methane concentration in the atmosphere at the end of the pleistocene epoch after the extinction of megafauna in the americas  after early humans migrated to the americas about 13,000 bp  their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there  calculations suggest that this extinction decreased methane production by about 9.6 million tons per year  this suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the younger dryas  83  the decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time  as recorded in ice cores  was 2-4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years  suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work  83   the hyperdisease hypothesis  proposed by ross macphee in 1997  states that the megafaunal die-off was due to an indirect transmission of diseases by newly arriving aboriginal humans  85][86][87  according to macphee  aboriginals or animals travelling with them  such as domestic dogs or livestock  introduced one or more highly virulent diseases into new environments whose native population had no immunity to  eventually leading to their extinction  k-selection animals  such as the now-extinct megafauna  are especially vulnerable to diseases  as opposed to r-selection animals who have a shorter gestation period and a higher population size  humans are thought to be the sole cause as other earlier migrations of animals into north america from eurasia did not cause extinctions  85   there are many problems with this theory in the scientific community  as this disease would have to meet several criteria  it has to be able to sustain itself in an environment with no hosts  it has to have a high infection rate  and be extremely lethal  with a mortality rate of 50\u201375   disease has to be very virulent to kill off all the individuals in a genus or species  and even such a virulent disease as west nile virus is unlikely to have caused extinction  88   however  diseases have been the cause for some extinctions  the introduction of avian malaria and avipoxvirus  for example  have had a negative impact on the endemic birds of hawaii  89   the loss of species from ecological communities  defaunation  is primarily driven by human activity  3  this has resulted in empty forests  ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates  94][95  this is not to be confused with extinction  as it includes both the disappearance of species and declines in abundance  96  defaunation effects were first implied at the symposium of plant-animal interactions at the university of campinas  brazil in 1988 in the context of neotropical forests  97  since then  the term has gained broader usage in conservation biology as a global phenomenon  98][97   big cat populations have been decimated over the last half-century and could face extinction in the following decades  according to iucn estimates  lions are down to 25,000  from 450,000  leopards are down to 50,000  from 750,000  cheetahs are down to 12,000  from 45,000  tigers are down to 3,000 in the wild  from 50,000.[99  a december 2016 study by the zoological society of london  panthera corporation and wildlife conservation society showed that cheetahs are far closer to extinction than previously thought  with only 7,100 remaining in the wild  and crammed within only 9  of their historic range  100  human pressures are to blame for the cheetah population crash  including prey loss due to overhunting by people  retaliatory killing from farmers  habitat loss and the illegal wildlife trade  101   the term pollinator decline refers to the reduction in abundance of insect and other animal pollinators in many ecosystems worldwide beginning at the end of the twentieth century  and continuing into the present day  102  pollinators  which are necessary for 75  of food crops  are declining globally in both abundance and diversity  103   various species are predicted to become extinct in the near future  105  among them the rhinoceros  106  primates  91  pangolins  107  and giraffes  108  hunting alone threatens hundreds of mammalian species around the world  109][110  scientists claim that the growing demand for meat is contributing to biodiversity loss as this is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction  species-rich habitats  such as significant portions of the amazon region  are being converted to agriculture for meat production  4][111][112  according to the world wildlife fund s 2016 living planet index  global wildlife populations have declined 58  since 1970  primarily due to habitat destruction  over-hunting and pollution  they project that if current trends continue  67  of wildlife could disappear by 2020.[113][114  189 countries  which are signatory to the convention on biological diversity  rio accord   115  have committed to preparing a biodiversity action plan  a first step at identifying specific endangered species and habitats  country by country  116   recent extinctions are more directly attributable to human influences  whereas prehistoric extinctions can be attributed to other factors  such as global climate change  2][3  the international union for conservation of nature  iucn  characterises  recent  extinction as those that have occurred past the cut-off point of 1500,[118  and at least 875 species have gone extinct since that time and 2012.[119  some species  such as the p xe8re david s deer 120  and the hawaiian crow  121  are extinct in the wild  and survive solely in captive populations  other species  such as the florida panther  are ecologically extinct  surviving in such low numbers that that they essentially have no impact on the ecosystem  122]:318 other populations are only locally extinct  extirpated   still existence elsewhere  but reduced in distribution  122]:75\u201377 as with the extinction of gray whales in the atlantic  123  and of the leatherback sea turtle in malaysia  124   global warming is widely accepted as being a contributor to extinction worldwide  in a similar way that previous extinction events have generally included a rapid change in global climate and meteorology  it is also expected to disrupt sex ratios in many reptiles which have temperature-dependent sex determination   the removal of land to clear way for palm oil plantations releases carbon emissions held in the peatlands of indonesia  127][128  palm oil mainly serves as a cheap cooking oil  129  and also as a  controversial  biofuel  however  damage to peatland contributes to 4  of global greenhouse gas emissions  and 8  of those caused by burning fossil fuels  130  palm oil cultivation has also been criticized for other impacts to the environment  131][132  including deforestation  133  which has threatened critically endangered species such as the orangutan  134][135  the iucn stated in 2016 that the species could go extinct within a decade if measures are not taken to preserve the rainforests in which they live  136   rising levels of carbon dioxide are resulting in influx of this gas into the ocean  increasing its acidity  marine organisms which possess calcium carbonate shells or exoskeletons experience physiological pressure as the carbonate reacts with acid  this is already resulting in coral bleaching on various coral reefs worldwide  which provide valuable habitat for very high biodiversity  marine gastropods  bivalves and other invertebrates are also affected  as are any organisms that feed on them   some researchers suggest that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans by weight  34   overhunting can reduce the local population of game animals by more than half  as well as reducing population density  and may lead to extinction for some species  138  populations located nearer to villages are significantly more at risk of depletion  139][140   the surge in the mass killings by poachers involved in the illegal ivory trade along with habitat loss is threatening african elephant populations  141][142  in 1979  their populations stood at 1.7 million  at present there are fewer than 400,000 remaining  143  prior to european colonization  scientists believe africa was home to roughly 20 million elephants  144  according to the great elephant census  30  of african elephants  or 144,000 individuals  disappeared over a seven-year period  2007 to 2014.[142][145  african elephants could become extinct by 2035 if poaching rates continue  146   fishing has had a devastating effect on marine organism populations for several centuries even before the explosion of destructive and highly effective fishing practices like trawling  147  humans are unique among predators in that they regularly predate on other adult apex predators  particularly in marine environments  35  bluefin tuna  blue whales  and various sharks in particular are particularly vulnerable to predation pressure from human fishing  a 2016 study published in science concludes that humans tend to hunt larger species  and this could disrupt ocean ecosystems for millions of years  148   the decline of amphibian populations has also been identified as an indicator of environmental degradation  as well as habitat loss  introduced predators and pollution  chytridiomycosis  a fungal infection thought to have been accidentally spread by human travel  1  has caused severe population drops of several species of frogs  including  among many others  the extinction of the golden toad in costa rica and the gastric-brooding frog in australia  many other amphibian species now face extinction  including the reduction of rabb s fringe-limbed treefrog to an endling  and the extinction of the panamanian golden frog in the wild  chytrid fungus has spread across australia  new zealand  central america and africa  including countries with high amphibian diversity such as cloud forests in honduras and madagascar  batrachochytrium salamandrivorans is a similar infection currently threatening salamanders  amphibians are now the most endangered vertebrate group  having existed for more than 300 million years through three other mass extinctions   millions of bats in the us have been dying off since 2012 due to a fungal infection spread from european bats  which appear to be immune  population drops have been as great as 90  within five years  and extinction of at least one bat species is predicted  there is currently no form of treatment  and such declines have been described as  unprecedented  in bat evolutionary history by alan hicks of the new york state department of environmental conservation   millions of years before present
