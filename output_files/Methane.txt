Methane
 methane  us /\u02c8m u025b u03b8e u026an  or uk /\u02c8mi u02d0\u03b8e u026an   is a chemical compound with the chemical formula ch4  one atom of carbon and four atoms of hydrogen   it is a group 14 hydride and the simplest alkane  and is the main constituent of natural gas  the relative abundance of methane on earth makes it an attractive fuel  though capturing and storing it poses challenges due to its gaseous state under normal conditions for temperature and pressure   natural methane is found both below ground and under the sea floor  when it reaches the surface and the atmosphere  it is known as atmospheric methane  5  the earth s atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150  since 1750  and it accounts for 20  of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases  these gases don t include water vapor which is by far the largest component of the greenhouse effect   6       in november 1776  methane was first scientifically identified by italian physicist alessandro volta in the marshes of lake maggiore straddling italy and switzerland  volta was inspired to search for the substance after reading a paper written by benjamin franklin about  flammable air   7  volta collected the gas rising from the marsh  and by 1778 had isolated the pure gas  8  he also demonstrated that the gas could be ignited with an electric spark  8   the name  methane  was coined in 1866 by the german chemist august wilhelm von hofmann  9  the name was derived from methanol   methane is a tetrahedral molecule with four equivalent c u2013h bonds  its electronic structure is described by four bonding molecular orbitals  mos  resulting from the overlap of the valence orbitals on c and h  the lowest energy mo is the result of the overlap of the 2s orbital on carbon with the in-phase combination of the 1s orbitals on the four hydrogen atoms  above this energy level is a triply degenerate set of mos that involve overlap of the 2p orbitals on carbon with various linear combinations of the 1s orbitals on hydrogen  the resulting  three-over-one  bonding scheme is consistent with photoelectron spectroscopic measurements   at room temperature and standard pressure  methane is a colorless  odorless gas  10  the familiar smell of natural gas as used in homes is achieved by the addition of an odorant  usually blends containing tert-butylthiol  as a safety measure  methane has a boiling point of \u2212161 \xb0c (\u2212257.8 \xb0f  at a pressure of one atmosphere  11  as a gas it is flammable over a range of concentrations (5.4\u201317   in air at standard pressure   solid methane exists in several modifications  presently nine are known  12  cooling methane at normal pressure results in the formation of methane i  this substance crystallizes in the cubic system  space group fm3m   the positions of the hydrogen atoms are not fixed in methane i  i e  methane molecules may rotate freely  therefore  it is a plastic crystal  13   the primary chemical reactions of methane are combustion  steam reforming to syngas  and halogenation  in general  methane reactions are difficult to control  partial oxidation to methanol  for example  is challenging because the reaction typically progresses all the way to carbon dioxide and water even with an insufficient supply of oxygen  the enzyme methane monooxygenase produces methanol from methane  but cannot be used for industrial-scale reactions  14   like other hydrocarbons  methane is a very weak acid  its pka in dmso is estimated to be 56.[15  it cannot be deprotonated in solution  but the conjugate base with methyllithium is known   a variety of positive ions derived from methane have been observed  mostly as unstable species in low-pressure gas mixtures  these include methenium or methyl cation ch  n3  methane cation ch  n4  and methanium or protonated methane ch  n5  some of these have been detected in outer space  methanium can also be produced as diluted solutions from methane with superacids  cations with higher charge  such as ch2+\n6 and ch3+\n7  have been studied theoretically and conjectured to be stable  16   despite the strength of its c u2013h bonds  there is intense interest in catalysts that facilitate c u2013h bond activation in methane  and other lower numbered alkanes   17   methane s heat of combustion is 55.5 mj kg  18  combustion of methane is a multiple step reaction  the following equations are part of the process  with the net result being   ch4   2 o2 \u2192 co2   2 h2o (\u0394h   \u2212891 k j mol  at standard conditions    the species m  signifies an energetic third body  from which energy is transferred during a molecular collision  formaldehyde  hcho or h n2co  is an early intermediate  reaction 7   oxidation of formaldehyde gives the formyl radical  hco  reactions 8\u201310   which then give carbon monoxide  co   reactions 11  12  amp  13   any resulting h2 oxidizes to h2o or other intermediates  reaction 14  15   finally  the co oxidizes  forming co2  reaction 16   in the final stages  reactions 17\u201319   energy is transferred back to other third bodies  the overall speed of reaction is a function of the concentration of the various entities during the combustion process  the higher the temperature  the greater the concentration of radical species and the more rapid the combustion process  19   given appropriate conditions  methane reacts with halogens as follows   where x is a halogen  fluorine  f   chlorine  cl   bromine  br   or iodine  i   this mechanism for this process is called free radical halogenation  it is initiated with uv light or some other radical initiator  a chlorine atom is generated from elemental chlorine  which abstracts a hydrogen atom from methane  resulting in the formation of hydrogen chloride  the resulting methyl radical  ch3\u2022  can combine with another chlorine molecule to give methyl chloride (ch3cl  and a chlorine atom  this chlorine atom can then react with another methane  or methyl chloride  molecule  repeating the chlorination cycle  20  similar reactions can produce dichloromethane (ch2cl2   chloroform (chcl3   and  ultimately  carbon tetrachloride (ccl4   depending upon reaction conditions and the chlorine to methane ratio   methane is used in industrial chemical processes and may be transported as a refrigerated liquid  liquefied natural gas  or lng   while leaks from a refrigerated liquid container are initially heavier than air due to the increased density of the cold gas  the gas at ambient temperature is lighter than air  gas pipelines distribute large amounts of natural gas  of which methane is the principal component   methane is used as a fuel for ovens  homes  water heaters  kilns  automobiles  21][22  turbines  and other things  it combusts with oxygen to create fire   methane is important for electricity generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator  compared to other hydrocarbon fuels  methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released  at about 891 kj mol  methane s heat of combustion is lower than any other hydrocarbon but the ratio of the heat of combustion (891 kj mol  to the molecular mass (16.0 g mol  of which 12.0 g mol is carbon  shows that methane  being the simplest hydrocarbon  produces more heat per mass unit (55.7 kj g  than other complex hydrocarbons  in many cities  methane is piped into homes for domestic heating and cooking  in this context it is usually known as natural gas  which is considered to have an energy content of 39 megajoules per cubic meter  or 1,000 btu per standard cubic foot   methane in the form of compressed natural gas is used as a vehicle fuel and is claimed to be more environmentally friendly than other fossil fuels such as gasoline petrol and diesel  22  research into adsorption methods of methane storage for use as an automotive fuel has been conducted  23   liquefied natural gas  lng  is natural gas  predominantly methane  ch4  that has been converted to liquid form for ease of storage or transport   liquefied natural gas takes up about 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state  it is odorless  colorless  non-toxic and non-corrosive  hazards include flammability after vaporization into a gaseous state  freezing  and asphyxia   the liquefaction process involves removal of certain components  such as dust  acid gases  helium  water  and heavy hydrocarbons  which could cause difficulty downstream  the natural gas is then condensed into a liquid at close to atmospheric pressure  maximum transport pressure set at around 25\xa0kpa or 3.6\xa0psi  by cooling it to approximately \u2212162\xa0\xb0c (\u2212260\xa0\xb0f   citation needed   lng achieves a higher reduction in volume than compressed natural gas  cng  so that the energy density of lng is 2.4\xa0times greater than that of cng or 60  that of diesel fuel  24  this makes lng cost efficient to transport over long distances where pipelines do not exist  specially designed cryogenic sea vessels  lng carriers  or cryogenic road tankers are used for its transport   lng  when it is not highly refined for special uses  is principally used for transporting natural gas to markets  where it is regasified and distributed as pipeline natural gas  it is also beginning to be used in lng-fueled road vehicles  for example  trucks in commercial operation have been achieving payback periods of approximately four years on the higher initial investment required in lng equipment on the trucks and lng infrastructure to support fueling  25  however  it remains more common to design vehicles to use compressed natural gas  as of 2002 update   the relatively higher cost of lng production and the need to store lng in more expensive cryogenic tanks had slowed widespread commercial use  26   in a highly refined form  liquid methane is used as a rocket fuel  27   though methane has been investigated for decades  no production methane engines have yet been used on orbital spaceflights  28  methane is reported to offer the advantage over kerosene of depositing less carbon on the internal parts of rocket motors  reducing the difficulty of re-use of boosters   since the 1990s  a number of russian rockets using liquid methane have been proposed  29][30  one 1990s russian engine proposal was the rd-192  a methane lox variant of the rd-191.[30   in 2005  us companies  orbitech and xcor aerospace  developed a demonstration liquid oxygen liquid methane rocket engine and a larger 7,500 pounds-force (33\xa0kn -thrust engine in 2007 for potential use as the cev lunar return engine  before the cev program was later cancelled  31][32][33   more recently the american private space company spacex announced in 2012 an initiative to develop liquid methane rocket engines  34  including initially  the very large raptor rocket engine  35  raptor is being designed to produce 4.4 meganewtons (1,000,000\xa0lbf  of thrust with a vacuum specific impulse  isp  of 363 seconds and a sea-level isp of 321 seconds  36  and began component-level testing in 2014.[37  in february 2014  the raptor engine design was shown to be of the highly efficient and theoretically more reliable full-flow staged combustion cycle type  where both propellant streams u2014oxidizer and fuel u2014are completely in the gas phase before they enter the combustion chamber  prior to 2014  only two full-flow rocket engines had ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands  but neither engine completed development or flew on a flight vehicle  36  in 2016  a development raptor engine was tested  38   in october 2013  the china aerospace science and technology corporation  a state-owned contractor for the chinese space program  announced that it had completed a first ignition test on a new lox methane rocket engine  no engine size was provided  39   in september 2014  another american private space company u2014blue origin u2014 publicly announced that they were into their third year of development work on a large methane rocket engine  the new engine  the blue engine 4  or be-4  has been designed to produce 2,400 kilonewtons (550,000\xa0lbf  of thrust  while initially planned to be used exclusively on a blue origin proprietary launch vehicle  it will now be used on a new united launch alliance  ula  engine on a new launch vehicle that is a successor to the atlas v  ula indicated in 2014 that they will make the maiden flight of the new launch vehicle no earlier than 2019.[40   one advantage of methane is that it is abundant in many parts of the solar system and it could potentially be harvested on the surface of another solar-system body  in particular  using methane production from local materials found on mars 41  or titan   providing fuel for a return journey  27][42   by 2013  nasa s project morpheus had developed a small restartable lox methane rocket engine with 5,000 pounds-force (22\xa0kn  thrust and a specific impulse of 321 seconds suitable for inspace applications including landers  small lox methane thrusters 5\u201315 pounds-force (22\u201367\xa0n  were also developed suitable for use in a reaction control system (rcs   43][44   spacenews is reporting in early 2015 that the french space agency cnes is working with germany and a few other governments and will propose a lox methane engine on a reusable launch vehicle by mid-2015  needs update  with flight testing unlikely before approximately 2026.[45   although there is great interest in converting methane into useful or more easily liquefied compounds  the only practical processes are relatively unselective  in the chemical industry  methane is converted to synthesis gas  a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen  by steam reforming  this endergonic process  requiring energy  utilizes nickel catalysts and requires high temperatures  around 700\u20131100\xa0\xb0c   related chemistries are exploited in the haber-bosch synthesis of ammonia from air  which is reduced with natural gas to a mixture of carbon dioxide  water  and ammonia   methane is also subjected to free-radical chlorination in the production of chloromethanes  although methanol is a more typical precursor  46   other commercially viable processes that use methane as a chemical feedstock include  the catalytic oxidation of methane into methanol 47  based on the oxidative coupling of methane  and the direct reaction of methane with sulfur trioxide to produce methanesulfonic acid  48][49   naturally occurring methane is mainly produced by microbial methanogenesis  this multistep process is used by microorganisms as an energy source  the net reaction is   the final step in the process is catalyzed by the enzyme coenzyme-b sulfoethylthiotransferase  methanogenesis is a form of anaerobic respiration used by organisms that occupy landfill  ruminants  e g   cattle   and the guts of termites   it is uncertain if plants are a source of methane emissions  50][51][52   there are many technological methane production methods  methane created from biomass in industrial plants via biological route is called biogas  a more synthetic method to produce methane is hydrogenating carbon dioxide through the sabatier process  methane is also a side product of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide in the fischer-tropsch process which is practiced on a large scale to produce longer chain molecules than methane  example of large scale coal-to-methane- gasification is the great plains synfuels plant  started in 1984 in beulah  north dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low grade lignite  a resource which is otherwise very hard to transport for its weight  ash content  low calorific value and propensity to spontaneous combustion during storage and transport   methane as natural gas has been so abundant that synthetic production of it has been limited to special cases and as of 2016 covers only minor fraction of the methane used   power to methane is a technology which uses electrical power to produce hydrogen from water by electrolysis and uses the sabatier reaction to combine hydrogen with carbon dioxide to produce methane  as of 2016 this is mostly under development and not in large scale use  theoretically  the process could be used as a buffer for excess and off-peak power generated by highly fluctuating wind generators and solar arrays  the conversion efficiency of power to methane is 49-65  and full power-methane-power clarification needed  cycle is 30\u201338    methane can be produced by the destructive distillation of acetic acid in the presence of soda lime or similar  acetic acid is decarboxylated in this process  methane can be prepared from aluminium carbide by reaction with water or strong acids  it is also made by reducing a solution of methanol and concentrated hydrochloric acid with iron powder  giving water and ferrous chloride as byproducts   methane has been proposed as a possible rocket propellant on future mars missions due in part to the possibility of synthesizing it on the planet via in situ resource utilization  53  an adaptation of the sabatier methanation reaction may be used via a mixed catalyst bed and a reverse water gas shift buzzword  in a single reactor to produce methane from the raw materials available on mars  utilizing water from the martian subsoil and carbon dioxide in the martian atmosphere  41   methane could also be produced by a non-biological process called serpentinization a  involving water  carbon dioxide  and the mineral olivine  which is known to be common on mars  54   methane was discovered and isolated by alessandro volta between 1776 and 1778 when studying marsh gas from lake maggiore  it is the major component of natural gas  about 87  by volume  the major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as natural gas fields  with coal seam gas extraction becoming a major source  see coal bed methane extraction  a method for extracting methane from a coal deposit  while enhanced coal bed methane recovery is a method of recovering methane from non-mineable coal seams   it is associated with other hydrocarbon fuels  and sometimes accompanied by helium and nitrogen  methane is produced at shallow levels  low pressure  by anaerobic decay of organic matter and reworked methane from deep under the earth s surface  in general  the sediments that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain oil   methane is generally transported in bulk by pipeline in its natural gas form  or lng carriers in its liquefied form  few countries transport it by truck   apart from gas fields  an alternative method of obtaining methane is via biogas generated by the fermentation of organic matter including manure  wastewater sludge  municipal solid waste  including landfills   or any other biodegradable feedstock  under anaerobic conditions  rice fields also generate large amounts of methane during plant growth  methane hydrates clathrates  ice-like combinations of methane and water on the sea floor  found in vast quantities  are a potential future source of methane  cattle belch methane accounts for 16  of the world s annual methane emissions to the atmosphere  55  one study reported that the livestock sector in general  primarily cattle  chickens  and pigs  produces 37  of all human-induced methane  56  early research has found a number of medical treatments and dietary adjustments that help slightly limit the production of methane in ruminants  57][58  a 2009 study found that at a conservative estimate  at least 51  of global greenhouse gas emissions were attributable to the life cycle and supply chain of livestock products  meaning all meat  dairy  and by-products  and their transportation  59  more recently  a 2013 study estimated that livestock accounted for 44 percent of human-induced methane and 14.5 percent of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions  60  many efforts are underway to reduce livestock methane production and trap the gas to use as energy  61   paleoclimatology research published in current biology suggests that flatulence from dinosaurs may have warmed the earth  62     methane is created near the earth s surface  primarily by microorganisms by the process of methanogenesis  it is carried into the stratosphere by rising air in the tropics  uncontrolled build-up of methane in the atmosphere is naturally checked xa0\u2013 although human influence can upset this natural regulation xa0\u2013 by methane s reaction with hydroxyl radicals formed from singlet oxygen atoms and with water vapor  it has a net lifetime of about 10 years  63  and is primarily removed by conversion to carbon dioxide and water   in addition  there is a large  but unknown  amount of methane in methane clathrates in the ocean floors as well as the earth s crust   in 2010  methane levels in the arctic were measured at 1850 nmol mol  a level over twice as high as at any time in the 400,000 years prior to the industrial revolution  historically  methane concentrations in the world s atmosphere have ranged between 300 and 400 nmol mol during glacial periods commonly known as ice ages  and between 600 and 700 nmol mol during the warm interglacial periods  recent research suggests that the earth s oceans are a potentially important new source of arctic methane  64   methane is an important greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 34 compared to co2 over a 100-year period  and 72 over a 20-year period  65][66][67   the earth s atmospheric methane concentration has increased by about 150  since 1750  and it accounts for 20  of the total radiative forcing from all of the long-lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases  these gases don t include water vapor which is by far the largest component of the greenhouse effect   6   methane is essentially insoluble in water  but it can be trapped in ice forming a similar solid  significant deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of earth at large depths   arctic methane release from permafrost and methane clathrates is an expected consequence and further cause of global warming  68][69][70   there is a group of bacteria that drive methane oxidation with nitrite as the oxidant  the anaerobic oxidation of methane  71   methane is nontoxic  yet it is extremely flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air  methane is violently reactive with oxidizers  halogen  and some halogen-containing compounds  methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space  asphyxia may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16  by displacement  as most people can tolerate a reduction from 21  to 16  without ill effects  the concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant is much higher than the 5\u201315  concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture  methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near landfills and expose occupants to significant levels of methane  some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building   methane gas explosions are responsible for many deadly mining disasters  72  a methane gas explosion was the cause of the upper big branch coal mine disaster in west virginia on april 5  2010  killing 25.[73   methane has been detected or is believed to exist on all planets of the solar system and most of the larger moons  with the possible exception of mars  it is believed to have come from abiotic processes
