 energy storage as a service  esaas  pronounced /i u2019s xe6s   allows a facility to benefit from the advantages of an energy storage system by entering into a service agreement without purchasing the system  energy storage systems provide a range of services to generate revenue  create savings  and improve electricity resiliency  the operation of the esaas system is a unique combination of an advanced battery storage system  an energy management system  and a service contract which can deliver value to a business by providing reliable power more economically       the term esaas was developed and trademarked by constant power inc   1  a toronto-based company  in 2016  the service has been designed to work in the north american open electricity markets  notable other companies offering energy storage-as-a-service 2  include aes corporation 3  and stem  4   esaas is the combination of an energy storage system  a control and monitoring system  and a service contract   the most common energy storage systems used for esaas are lithium-ion 5  or flow 6  batteries due to their compact size  non-invasive installation  high efficiencies  and fast reaction times but other storage mediums may be used such as compressed air  7  flywheels  8  or pumped hydro  9][10  the batteries are sized based on the facility s needs and is paired with a power inverter to convert the dc power to ac power in order to connect directly to the facility u2019s electricity supply   esaas systems are remotely monitored and controlled by the esaas operator using a supervisory control and data acquisition  scada  system  11  the scada communicates with the facility s energy management system (ems   12  power conversion system (pcs   13  and battery management system (bms   14  the esaas operator is responsible for ensuring the esaas system is monitoring and responding to the facility u2019s needs as well as overriding commands to participate in regional incentive programs such as coincident peak management and demand response programs in real time   the facility benefiting from the esaas system is linked to the esaas system operator through a service contract  the contract specifies the length of the service term  payment structure  and list of services the facility wishes to participate in   esaas is used to perform a variety of services including   esaas primarily benefits large energy consumers with an average demand of over 500\xa0kw  24  although  the service may benefit smaller facilities depending on regional incentives  25  current early adopters of esaas are manufacturers  chemical  electrical  lighting  metal  petrochemical  plastics   commercial  retail  large offices  medium offices  multi-residential  supermarkets   public facilities  colleges  universities  hotels  hospitality  schools   and resources  oil  amp  extraction  pulp  amp  paper  metals  amp  ore  food processing  greenhouses    to participate in an esaas service  the installation system benefactor does not require any capital outlay  26  upon installing an esaas service  the facility sees immediate savings and or revenue generation  initial capital is often a hurdle for facilities to adopt an energy storage system since in most cases  the payback period 27  of an energy storage system is 5\u201310 years  28   esaas is a contracted service 30  that is automatically controlled by a third party  this eliminates responsibility for the facility 31  to allocate resources to manage their energy profile allowing a facility to operate their core business  the system operators have knowledge of local electricity sectors that continually monitor and update 32  system protocols as regional markets change  the information is used to optimize the value realized by the esaas system while still meeting facility requirements   for most esaas services  energy is stored during night time  off-peak hours when energy production is created from non-carbon emitting sources  33  the energy is then used to offset the required carbon emitting 34  production during peak-times  the load shifting capability provided by esaas displaces heavy emitting generation requirements   esaas contracts have a fixed monthly price over a contracted term  35  the fixed price is based on potential economic benefit and applicable programs in the region of deployment  the esaas contract price is always less than the economic value provided by the service to ensure the client retains a net positive value through the service
