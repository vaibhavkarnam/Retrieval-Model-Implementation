InternationalElectrotechnicalCommission
 the international electrotechnical commission 1   iec  in french  commission \xe9lectrotechnique internationale  is a non-profit  non-governmental international standards organization that prepares and publishes international standards for all electrical  electronic and related technologies \u2013 collectively known as  electrotechnology   iec standards cover a vast range of technologies from power generation  transmission and distribution to home appliances and office equipment  semiconductors  fibre optics  batteries  solar energy  nanotechnology and marine energy as well as many others  the iec also manages three global conformity assessment systems that certify whether equipment  system or components conform to its international standards   the iec charter embraces all electrotechnologies including energy production and distribution  electronics  magnetics and electromagnetics  electroacoustics  multimedia  telecommunication and medical technology  as well as associated general disciplines such as terminology and symbols  electromagnetic compatibility  by its advisory committee on electromagnetic compatibility  acec   measurement and performance  dependability  design and development  safety and the environment       the international electronical commission held its inaugural meeting on 26 june 1906  following discussions between the british institution of electrical engineers  the american institute of electrical engineers  and others  which began at the 1900 paris international electrical congress  and continued with colonel r  e  b  crompton playing a key role   the iec was instrumental in developing and distributing standards for units of measurement  particularly gauss  hertz  and weber  citation needed  it also first proposed a system of standards  the giorgi system  which ultimately became the si  or syst xe8me international d u2019unit xe9s  in english  the international system of units    in 1938  it published a multilingual international vocabulary to unify terminology relating to electrical  electronic and related technologies  this effort continues  and the international electrotechnical vocabulary  the on-line version of which is known as the electropedia  remains an important work in the electrical and electronic industries   the cispr (comit xe9 international sp xe9cial des perturbations radio xe9lectriques  \u2013 in english  the international special committee on radio interference \u2013 is one of the groups founded by the iec   currently  82 countries are members while another 82 participate in the affiliate country programme  which is not a form of membership but is designed to help industrializing countries get involved with the iec  originally located in london  the commission moved to its current headquarters in geneva in 1948   it has regional centres in asia-pacific  singapore   latin america (s xe3o paulo  brazil  and north america  boston  united states    today  the iec is the world s leading international organization in its field  and its standards are adopted as national standards by its members  the work is done by some 10,000 electrical and electronics experts from industry  government  academia  test labs and others with an interest in the subject   iec standards have numbers in the range 60000\u201379999 and their titles take a form such as iec 60417  graphical symbols for use on equipment  following the dresden agreement with cenelec the numbers of older iec standards were converted in 1997 by adding 60000  for example iec 27 became iec 60027  standards of the 60000 series are also found preceded by en to indicate that the iec standard is also adopted by cenelec as a european standard  for example iec 60034 is also available as en 60034   the iec cooperates closely with the international organization for standardization  iso  and the international telecommunication union  itu   in addition  it works with several major standards development organizations  including the ieee with which it signed a cooperation agreement in 2002  which was amended in 2008 to include joint development work   standards developed jointly with iso such as iso iec 26300  open document format for office applications  opendocument  v1.0   iso iec 27001  information technology  security techniques  information security management systems  requirements   and casco iso iec 17000 series  carry the acronym of both organizations  the use of the iso iec prefix covers publications from iso iec joint technical committee 1 - information technology  as well as conformity assessment standards developed by iso casco and iec cab  conformity assessment board   other standards developed in cooperation between iec and iso are assigned numbers in the 80000 series  such as iec 82045-1   iec standards are also being adopted by other certifying bodies such as bsi  united kingdom   csa  canada   ul  amp  ansi incits  united states   sabs  south africa   sai  australia   spc gb  china  and din  germany   iec standards adopted by other certifying bodies may have some noted differences from the original iec standard  2   the iec is made up of members  called national committees  and each nc represents its nation s electrotechnical interests in the iec  this includes manufacturers  providers  distributors and vendors  consumers and users  all levels of governmental agencies  professional societies and trade associations as well as standards developers from national standards bodies  national committees are constituted in different ways  some ncs are public sector only  some are a combination of public and private sector  and some are private sector only  about 90  of those who prepare iec standards work in industry   iec member countries include  3   in 2001 and in response to calls from the wto to open itself to more developing nations  the iec launched the affiliate country programme to encourage developing nations to become involved in the commission s work or to use its international standards  countries signing a pledge to participate in the work and to encourage the use of iec standards in national standards and regulations are granted access to a limited number of technical committee documents for the purposes of commenting  in addition  they can select a limited number of iec standards for their national standards  library  countries as of 2011 participating in the affiliate country programme are  8
