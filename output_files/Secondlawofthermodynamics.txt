Secondlawofthermodynamics
 the second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time or it can remain constant in ideal cases where the system is in a steady state  equilibrium  or undergoing a reversible process  the increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes  and the asymmetry between future and past   historically  the second law was an empirical finding that was accepted as an axiom of thermodynamic theory  statistical thermodynamics  classical or quantum  explains the microscopic origin of the law   the second law has been expressed in many ways  its first formulation is credited to the french scientist sadi carnot in 1824  who showed that there is an upper limit to the efficiency of conversion of heat to work in a heat engine       the first law of thermodynamics provides the basic definition of internal energy  associated with all thermodynamic systems  and states the rule of conservation of energy  1][2  the second law is concerned with the direction of natural processes  3  it asserts that a natural process runs only in one sense  and is not reversible  for example  heat always flows spontaneously from hotter to colder bodies  and never the reverse  unless external work is performed on the system  its modern definition is in terms of entropy  4][5   in a fictive reversible process  an infinitesimal increment in the entropy  ds  of a system is defined to result from an infinitesimal transfer of heat (\u03b4q  to a closed system divided by the common temperature  t  of the system and the surroundings which supply the heat  6   different notations are used for infinitesimal amounts of heat (\u03b4  and infinitesimal amounts of entropy  d  because entropy is a function of state  while heat  like work  is not  for an actually possible infinitesimal process without exchange of matter with the surroundings  the second law requires that the increment in system entropy be greater than that   this is because a general process for this case may include work being done on the system by its surroundings  which must have frictional or viscous effects inside the system  and because heat transfer actually occurs only irreversibly  driven by a finite temperature difference  7][8   the zeroth law of thermodynamics in its usual short statement allows recognition that two bodies in a relation of thermal equilibrium have the same temperature  especially that a test body has the same temperature as a reference thermometric body  9  for a body in thermal equilibrium with another  there are indefinitely many empirical temperature scales  in general respectively depending on the properties of a particular reference thermometric body  the second law allows a distinguished temperature scale  which defines an absolute  thermodynamic temperature  independent of the properties of any particular reference thermometric body  10][11   the second law of thermodynamics may be expressed in many specific ways  12  the most prominent classical statements 13  being the statement by rudolf clausius (1854   the statement by lord kelvin (1851   and the statement in axiomatic thermodynamics by constantin carath xe9odory (1909   these statements cast the law in general physical terms citing the impossibility of certain processes  the clausius and the kelvin statements have been shown to be equivalent  14   the historical origin of the second law of thermodynamics was in carnot s principle  it refers to a cycle of a carnot heat engine  fictively operated in the limiting mode of extreme slowness known as quasi-static  so that the heat and work transfers are between subsystems that are always in their own internal states of thermodynamic equilibrium  the carnot engine is an idealized device of special interest to engineers who are concerned with the efficiency of heat engines  carnot s principle was recognized by carnot at a time when the caloric theory of heat was seriously considered  before the recognition of the first law of thermodynamics  and before the mathematical expression of the concept of entropy  interpreted in the light of the first law  it is physically equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics  and remains valid today  it states  the efficiency of a quasi-static or reversible carnot cycle depends only on the temperatures of the two heat reservoirs  and is the same  whatever the working substance  a carnot engine operated in this way is the most efficient possible heat engine using those two temperatures  15][16][17][18][19][20][21   the german scientist rudolf clausius laid the foundation for the second law of thermodynamics in 1850 by examining the relation between heat transfer and work  22  his formulation of the second law  which was published in german in 1854  is known as the clausius statement   heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change  connected therewith  occurring at the same time  23   the statement by clausius uses the concept of  passage of heat   as is usual in thermodynamic discussions  this means  net transfer of energy as heat   and does not refer to contributory transfers one way and the other   heat cannot spontaneously flow from cold regions to hot regions without external work being performed on the system  which is evident from ordinary experience of refrigeration  for example  in a refrigerator  heat flows from cold to hot  but only when forced by an external agent  the refrigeration system   lord kelvin expressed the second law as  it is impossible  by means of inanimate material agency  to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects  24   suppose there is an engine violating the kelvin statement  i e   one that drains heat and converts it completely into work in a cyclic fashion without any other result  now pair it with a reversed carnot engine as shown by the figure  the net and sole effect of this newly created engine consisting of the two engines mentioned is transferring heat \n n n n u0394\nq n  nq n n  n n n1\n

violation of the kelvin statement implies a violation of the clausius statement  i e  the clausius statement implies the kelvin statement  we can prove in a similar manner that the kelvin statement implies the clausius statement  and hence the two are equivalent   planck offered the following proposition as derived directly from experience  this is sometimes regarded as his statement of the second law  but he regarded it as a starting point for the derivation of the second law   it is almost customary in textbooks to speak of the  kelvin-planck statement  of the law  as for example in the text by ter haar and wergeland  27  one text gives a statement very like planck s proposition  but attributes it to kelvin without mention of planck  28  one monograph quotes planck s proposition as the  kelvin-planck  formulation  the text naming kelvin as its author  though it correctly cites planck in its references  29  the reader may compare the two statements quoted just above here   planck stated the second law as follows   rather like planck s statement is that of uhlenbeck and ford for irreversible phenomena   constantin carath xe9odory formulated thermodynamics on a purely mathematical axiomatic foundation  his statement of the second law is known as the principle of carath xe9odory  which may be formulated as follows  34   in every neighborhood of any state s of an adiabatically enclosed system there are states inaccessible from s  35   with this formulation  he described the concept of adiabatic accessibility for the first time and provided the foundation for a new subfield of classical thermodynamics  often called geometrical thermodynamics  it follows from carath xe9odory s principle that quantity of energy quasi-statically transferred as heat is a holonomic process function  in other words  \n n n n u03b4 nq n  nt nd ns n n n   displaystyle   delta q tds  n n  36   clarification needed   though it is almost customary in textbooks to say that carath xe9odory s principle expresses the second law and to treat it as equivalent to the clausius or to the kelvin-planck statements  such is not the case  to get all the content of the second law  carath xe9odory s principle needs to be supplemented by planck s principle  that isochoric work always increases the internal energy of a closed system that was initially in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium  8][37][38][39   clarification needed   in 1926  max planck wrote an important paper on the basics of thermodynamics  38][40  he indicated the principle  this formulation does not mention heat and does not mention temperature  nor even entropy  and does not necessarily implicitly rely on those concepts  but it implies the content of the second law  a closely related statement is that  frictional pressure never does positive work   41  using a now-obsolete form of words  planck himself wrote   the production of heat by friction is irreversible   42][43   not mentioning entropy  this principle of planck is stated in physical terms  it is very closely related to the kelvin statement given just above  44  it is relevant that for a system at constant volume and mole numbers  the entropy is a monotonic function of the internal energy  nevertheless  this principle of planck is not actually planck s preferred statement of the second law  which is quoted above  in a previous sub-section of the present section of this present article  and relies on the concept of entropy   a statement that in a sense is complementary to planck s principle is made by borgnakke and sonntag  they do not offer it as a full statement of the second law   differing from planck s just foregoing principle  this one is explicitly in terms of entropy change  of course  removal of matter from a system can also decrease its entropy   the second law has been shown to be equivalent to the internal energy u being a weakly convex function  when written as a function of extensive properties  mass  volume  entropy  ...).[46][47   clarification needed   before the establishment of the second law  many people who were interested in inventing a perpetual motion machine had tried to circumvent the restrictions of first law of thermodynamics by extracting the massive internal energy of the environment as the power of the machine  such a machine is called a  perpetual motion machine of the second kind   the second law declared the impossibility of such machines   carnot s theorem (1824  is a principle that limits the maximum efficiency for any possible engine  the efficiency solely depends on the temperature difference between the hot and cold thermal reservoirs  carnot s theorem states   in his ideal model  the heat of caloric converted into work could be reinstated by reversing the motion of the cycle  a concept subsequently known as thermodynamic reversibility  carnot  however  further postulated that some caloric is lost  not being converted to mechanical work  hence  no real heat engine could realise the carnot cycle s reversibility and was condemned to be less efficient   though formulated in terms of caloric  see the obsolete caloric theory   rather than entropy  this was an early insight into the second law   the clausius theorem (1854  states that in a cyclic process  the equality holds in the reversible case 48  and the   lt   is in the irreversible case  the reversible case is used to introduce the state function entropy  this is because in cyclic processes the variation of a state function is zero from state functionality   for an arbitrary heat engine  the efficiency is   where wn is for the net work done per cycle  thus the efficiency depends only on qc qh   carnot s theorem states that all reversible engines operating between the same heat reservoirs are equally efficient  thus  any reversible heat engine operating between temperatures t1 and t2 must have the same efficiency  that is to say  the efficiency is the function of temperatures only  \n n n n n n nq n nc n n n nq n nh n n n n n  nf n  n nt n nh n n n  n nt n nc n n n  n n  n2 n  n  n n n   displaystyle    frac  q  c   q  h    f t  h

intermediate  temperature t2  and the second between t2 andt3  this can only be the case if  now consider the case where \n n n n nt n n1 n n n n n   displaystyle t  1   n n is a fixed reference temperature  the temperature of the triple point of water  then for any t2 and t3   therefore  if thermodynamic temperature is defined by  then the function f  viewed as a function of thermodynamic temperature  is simply  and the reference temperature t1 will have the value 273.16   of course any reference temperature and any positive numerical value could be used u2014the choice here corresponds to the kelvin scale    according to the clausius equality  for a reversible process  that means the line integral \n n n n n u222b n nl n n n n n n u03b4 nq n nt n n n n n   displaystyle   int   l    frac    delta q  t    n n is path independent   so we can define a state function s called entropy  which satisfies  with this we can only obtain the difference of entropy by integrating the above formula  to obtain the absolute value  we need the third law of thermodynamics  which states that s 0 at absolute zero for perfect crystals   for any irreversible process  since entropy is a state function  we can always connect the initial and terminal states with an imaginary reversible process and integrating on that path to calculate the difference in entropy   now reverse the reversible process and combine it with the said irreversible process  applying clausius inequality on this loop   thus   where the equality holds if the transformation is reversible   notice that if the process is an adiabatic process  then \n n n n u03b4\nq n  n0 n n n   displaystyle   delta q 0  n n  so \n n n n u0394\ns n u2265\n0 n n n   displaystyle   delta s  geq 0  n n   an important and revealing idealized special case is to consider applying the second law to the scenario of an isolated system  called the total system or universe   made up of two parts  a sub-system of interest  and the sub-system s surroundings  these surroundings are imagined to be so large that they can be considered as an unlimited heat reservoir at temperature tr and pressure pr \u2014 so that no matter how much heat is transferred to  or from  the sub-system  the temperature of the surroundings will remain tr  and no matter how much the volume of the sub-system expands  or contracts   the pressure of the surroundings will remain pr   whatever changes to ds and dsr occur in the entropies of the sub-system and the surroundings individually  according to the second law the entropy stot of the isolated total system must not decrease   according to the first law of thermodynamics  the change du in the internal energy of the sub-system is the sum of the heat \u03b4q added to the sub-system  less any work \u03b4w done by the sub-system  plus any net chemical energy entering the sub-system d \u2211\u03bcirni  so that   where \u03bcir are the chemical potentials of chemical species in the external surroundings   now the heat leaving the reservoir and entering the sub-system is  where we have first used the definition of entropy in classical thermodynamics  alternatively  in statistical thermodynamics  the relation between entropy change  temperature and absorbed heat can be derived   and then the second law inequality from above   it therefore follows that any net work \u03b4w done by the sub-system must obey  it is useful to separate the work \u03b4w done by the subsystem into the useful work \u03b4wu that can be done by the sub-system  over and beyond the work pr dv done merely by the sub-system expanding against the surrounding external pressure  giving the following relation for the useful work  exergy  that can be done   it is convenient to define the right-hand-side as the exact derivative of a thermodynamic potential  called the availability or exergy e of the subsystem   the second law therefore implies that for any process which can be considered as divided simply into a subsystem  and an unlimited temperature and pressure reservoir with which it is in contact   i e  the change in the subsystem s exergy plus the useful work done by the subsystem  or  the change in the subsystem s exergy less any work  additional to that done by the pressure reservoir  done on the system  must be less than or equal to zero   in sum  if a proper infinite-reservoir-like reference state is chosen as the system surroundings in the real world  then the second law predicts a decrease in e for an irreversible process and no change for a reversible process   this expression together with the associated reference state permits a design engineer working at the macroscopic scale  above the thermodynamic limit  to utilize the second law without directly measuring or considering entropy change in a total isolated system   also  see process engineer   those changes have already been considered by the assumption that the system under consideration can reach equilibrium with the reference state without altering the reference state  an efficiency for a process or collection of processes that compares it to the reversible ideal may also be found  see second law efficiency    this approach to the second law is widely utilized in engineering practice  environmental accounting  systems ecology  and other disciplines   the first theory of the conversion of heat into mechanical work is due to nicolas l xe9onard sadi carnot in 1824  he was the first to realize correctly that the efficiency of this conversion depends on the difference of temperature between an engine and its environment   recognizing the significance of james prescott joule s work on the conservation of energy  rudolf clausius was the first to formulate the second law during 1850  in this form  heat does not flow spontaneously from cold to hot bodies  while common knowledge now  this was contrary to the caloric theory of heat popular at the time  which considered heat as a fluid  from there he was able to infer the principle of sadi carnot and the definition of entropy (1865    established during the 19th century  the kelvin-planck statement of the second law says   it is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work   this was shown to be equivalent to the statement of clausius   the ergodic hypothesis is also important for the boltzmann approach  it says that  over long periods of time  the time spent in some region of the phase space of microstates with the same energy is proportional to the volume of this region  i e  that all accessible microstates are equally probable over a long period of time  equivalently  it says that time average and average over the statistical ensemble are the same   there is a traditional doctrine  starting with clausius  that entropy can be understood in terms of molecular  disorder  within a macroscopic system  this doctrine is obsolescent  49][50][51   in 1856  the german physicist rudolf clausius stated what he called the  second fundamental theorem in the mechanical theory of heat  in the following form  52   where q is heat  t is temperature and n is the  equivalence-value  of all uncompensated transformations involved in a cyclical process  later  in 1865  clausius would come to define  equivalence-value  as entropy  on the heels of this definition  that same year  the most famous version of the second law was read in a presentation at the philosophical society of zurich on april 24  in which  in the end of his presentation  clausius concludes   the entropy of the universe tends to a maximum   this statement is the best-known phrasing of the second law  because of the looseness of its language  e g  universe  as well as lack of specific conditions  e g  open  closed  or isolated  many people take this simple statement to mean that the second law of thermodynamics applies virtually to every subject imaginable  this  of course  is not true  this statement is only a simplified version of a more extended and precise description   in terms of time variation  the mathematical statement of the second law for an isolated system undergoing an arbitrary transformation is   where  the equality sign applies after equilibration  an alternative way of formulating of the second law for isolated systems is   with \n n n n n n n ns n u02d9 n n n n ni n n n n n   displaystyle    dot  s    i   n n the sum of the rate of entropy production by all processes inside the system  the advantage of this formulation is that it shows the effect of the entropy production  the rate of entropy production is a very important concept since it determines  limits  the efficiency of thermal machines  multiplied with ambient temperature  n n n n nt n na n n n n n   displaystyle t  a   n n it gives the so-called dissipated energy \n n n n np n nd ni ns ns n n n  n nt n na n n n n n n ns n u02d9 n n n n ni n n n n n   displaystyle p  diss  t  a    dot  s    i   n n   the expression of the second law for closed systems  so  allowing heat exchange and moving boundaries  but not exchange of matter  is   here  the equality sign holds in the case that only reversible processes take place inside the system  if irreversible processes take place  which is the case in real systems in operation  the  gt -sign holds  if heat is supplied to the system at several places we have to take the algebraic sum of the corresponding terms   for open systems  also allowing exchange of matter    here \n n n n n n ns n u02d9 n n n n n n   displaystyle    dot  s    n n is the flow of entropy into the system associated with the flow of matter entering the system  it should not be confused with the time derivative of the entropy  if matter is supplied at several places we have to take the algebraic sum of these contributions   statistical mechanics gives an explanation for the second law by postulating that a material is composed of atoms and molecules which are in constant motion  a particular set of positions and velocities for each particle in the system is called a microstate of the system and because of the constant motion  the system is constantly changing its microstate  statistical mechanics postulates that  in equilibrium  each microstate that the system might be in is equally likely to occur  and when this assumption is made  it leads directly to the conclusion that the second law must hold in a statistical sense  that is  the second law will hold on average  with a statistical variation on the order of 1/\u221an where n is the number of particles in the system  for everyday  macroscopic  situations  the probability that the second law will be violated is practically zero  however  for systems with a small number of particles  thermodynamic parameters  including the entropy  may show significant statistical deviations from that predicted by the second law  classical thermodynamic theory does not deal with these statistical variations   due to loschmidt s paradox  derivations of the second law have to make an assumption regarding the past  namely that the system is uncorrelated at some time in the past  this allows for simple probabilistic treatment  this assumption is usually thought as a boundary condition  and thus the second law is ultimately a consequence of the initial conditions somewhere in the past  probably at the beginning of the universe  the big bang   though other scenarios have also been suggested  53][54][55   given these assumptions  in statistical mechanics  the second law is not a postulate  rather it is a consequence of the fundamental postulate  also known as the equal prior probability postulate  so long as one is clear that simple probability arguments are applied only to the future  while for the past there are auxiliary sources of information which tell us that it was low entropy  citation needed  the first part of the second law  which states that the entropy of a thermally isolated system can only increase  is a trivial consequence of the equal prior probability postulate  if we restrict the notion of the entropy to systems in thermal equilibrium  the entropy of an isolated system in thermal equilibrium containing an amount of energy of  n n n ne n n n   displaystyle e  n n is   where \n n n n u03a9 n n  ne n  n n n n   displaystyle   omega   left e  right   n n is the number of quantum states in a small interval between  n n n ne n n n   displaystyle e  n n and \n n n ne n  n u03b4 ne n n n   displaystyle e   delta e  n n  here \n n n n u03b4 ne n n n   displaystyle   delta e  n n is a macroscopically small energy interval that is kept fixed  strictly speaking this means that the entropy depends on the choice of \n n n n u03b4 ne n n n   displaystyle   delta e  n n  however  in the thermodynamic limit  i e  in the limit of infinitely large system size   the specific entropy  entropy per unit volume or per unit mass  does not depend on \n n n n u03b4 ne n n n   displaystyle   delta e  n n   suppose we have an isolated system whose macroscopic state is specified by a number of variables  these macroscopic variables can  e g   refer to the total volume  the positions of pistons in the system  etc  then \n n n n u03a9 n n n   displaystyle   omega   n n will depend on the values of these variables  if a variable is not fixed   e g  we do not clamp a piston in a certain position   then because all the accessible states are equally likely in equilibrium  the free variable in equilibrium will be such that \n n n n u03a9 n n n   displaystyle   omega   n n is maximized as that is the most probable situation in equilibrium   if the variable was initially fixed to some value then upon release and when the new equilibrium has been reached  the fact the variable will adjust itself so that \n n n n u03a9 n n n   displaystyle   omega   n n is maximized  implies that the entropy will have increased or it will have stayed the same  if the value at which the variable was fixed happened to be the equilibrium value   suppose we start from an equilibrium situation and we suddenly remove a constraint on a variable  then right after we do this  there are a number \n n n n u03a9 n n n   displaystyle   omega   n n of accessible microstates  but equilibrium has not yet been reached  so the actual probabilities of the system being in some accessible state are not yet equal to the prior probability of \n n n n1\n n  n n u03a9 n n n   displaystyle 1   omega   n n  we have already seen that in the final equilibrium state  the entropy will have increased or have stayed the same relative to the previous equilibrium state  boltzmann s h-theorem  however  proves that the quantity h increases monotonically as a function of time during the intermediate out of equilibrium state   the second part of the second law states that the entropy change of a system undergoing a reversible process is given by   where the temperature is defined as   see here for the justification for this definition  suppose that the system has some external parameter  x  that can be changed  in general  the energy eigenstates of the system will depend on x  according to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics  in the limit of an infinitely slow change of the system s hamiltonian  the system will stay in the same energy eigenstate and thus change its energy according to the change in energy of the energy eigenstate it is in   the generalized force  x  corresponding to the external variable x is defined such that  n n n nx nd nx n n n   displaystyle xdx  n n is the work performed by the system if x is increased by an amount dx  e g   if x is the volume  then x is the pressure  the generalized force for a system known to be in energy eigenstate  n n n n ne n nr n n n n n   displaystyle e  r   n n is given by   since the system can be in any energy eigenstate within an interval of \n n n n u03b4 ne n n n   displaystyle   delta e  n n  we define the generalized force for the system as the expectation value of the above expression   to evaluate the average  we partition the \n n n n u03a9 n n  ne n  n n n n   displaystyle   omega   left e  right   n n energy eigenstates by counting how many of them have a value for  n n n n n n nd n ne n nr n n n n nd nx

number \n n n n n u03a9 n ny n n n n  ne n  n n n n   displaystyle   omega   y   left e  right   n n  we have   the average defining the generalized force can now be written   we can relate this to the derivative of the entropy with respect to x at constant energy e as follows  suppose we change x to x   dx  then \n n n n u03a9 n n  ne n  n n n n   displaystyle   omega   left e  right   n n will change because the energy eigenstates depend on x  causing energy eigenstates to move into or out of the range between  n n n ne n n n   displaystyle e  n n and \n n n ne n  n u03b4 ne n n n   displaystyle e   delta e  n n  let s focus again on the energy eigenstates for which  n n n n n n nd n ne n nr n n n n nd nx n n n n n n   displaystyle    frac  de  r   dx    n n lies within the range between  n n n ny n n n   displaystyle y  n n and \n n n ny n  n u03b4 ny n n n   displaystyle y   delta y  n n  since these energy eigenstates increase in energy by y dx  all such energy eigenstates that are in the interval ranging from e \u2013 y dx to e move from below e to above e  there are  such energy eigenstates  if \n n n ny nd nx n u2264\n u03b4 ne n n n   displaystyle ydx  leq   delta e  n n  all these energy eigenstates will move into the range between  n n n ne n n n   displaystyle e  n n and \n n n ne n  n u03b4 ne n n n   displaystyle e   delta e  n n and contribute to an increase in \n n n n u03a9 n n n   displaystyle   omega   n n  the number of energy eigenstates that move from below \n n n ne n  n u03b4 ne n n n   displaystyle e   delta e  n n to above \n n n ne n  n u03b4 ne n n n   displaystyle e   delta e  n n is  of course  given by \n n n n nn n ny n n n n  ne n  n u03b4 ne n  n n n n   displaystyle n  y   left e   delta e  right   n n  the difference  is thus the net contribution to the increase in \n n n n u03a9 n n n   displaystyle   omega   n n  note that if y dx is larger than \n n n n u03b4 ne n n n   displaystyle   delta e  n n there will be the energy eigenstates that move from below e to above \n n n ne n  n u03b4 ne n n n   displaystyle e   delta e  n n  they are counted in both  n n n n nn n ny n n n n  ne n  n n n n   displaystyle n  y   left e  right   n n and \n n n n nn n ny n n n n  ne n  n u03b4 ne n  n n n n   displaystyle n  y   left e   delta e  right   n n  therefore the above expression is also valid in that case   expressing the above expression as a derivative with respect to e and summing over y yields the expression   the logarithmic derivative of \n n n n u03a9 n n n   displaystyle   omega   n n with respect to x is thus given by   the first term is intensive  i e  it does not scale with system size  in contrast  the last term scales as the inverse system size and will thus vanishes in the thermodynamic limit  we have thus found that   combining this with  gives   if a system is in thermal contact with a heat bath at some temperature t then  in equilibrium  the probability distribution over the energy eigenvalues are given by the canonical ensemble   here z is a factor that normalizes the sum of all the probabilities to 1  this function is known as the partition function  we now consider an infinitesimal reversible change in the temperature and in the external parameters on which the energy levels depend  it follows from the general formula for the entropy   that  inserting the formula for  n n n n np n nj n n n n n   displaystyle p  j   n n for the canonical ensemble in here gives   there are two principal ways of formulating thermodynamics   a  through passages from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another  and  b  through cyclic processes  by which the system is left unchanged  while the total entropy of the surroundings is increased  these two ways help to understand the processes of life  this topic is mostly beyond the scope of this present article  but has been considered by several authors  such as erwin schr xf6dinger  l xe9on brillouin 56  and isaac asimov  it is also the topic of current research   to a fair approximation  living organisms may be considered as examples of  b   approximately  an animal s physical state cycles by the day  leaving the animal nearly unchanged  animals take in food  water  and oxygen  and  as a result of metabolism  give out breakdown products and heat  plants take in radiative energy from the sun  which may be regarded as heat  and carbon dioxide and water  they give out oxygen  in this way they grow  eventually they die  and their remains rot  this can be regarded as a cyclic process  overall  the sunlight is from a high temperature source  the sun  and its energy is passed to a lower temperature sink  the soil  this is an increase of entropy of the surroundings of the plant  thus animals and plants obey the second law of thermodynamics  considered in terms of cyclic processes  simple concepts of efficiency of heat engines are hardly applicable to this problem because they assume closed systems   from the thermodynamic viewpoint that considers  a   passages from one equilibrium state to another  only a roughly approximate picture appears  because living organisms are never in states of thermodynamic equilibrium  living organisms must often be considered as open systems  because they take in nutrients and give out waste products  thermodynamics of open systems is currently often considered in terms of passages from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another  or in terms of flows in the approximation of local thermodynamic equilibrium  the problem for living organisms may be further simplified by the approximation of assuming a steady state with unchanging flows  general principles of entropy production for such approximations are subject to unsettled current debate or research  nevertheless  ideas derived from this viewpoint on the second law of thermodynamics are enlightening about living creatures   in systems that do not require for their descriptions the general theory of relativity  bodies always have positive heat capacity  meaning that the temperature rises with energy  therefore  when energy flows from a high-temperature object to a low-temperature object  the source temperature is decreased while the sink temperature is increased  hence temperature differences tend to diminish over time  this is not always the case for systems in which the gravitational force is important and the general theory of relativity is required  such systems can spontaneously change towards uneven spread of mass and energy  this applies to the universe in large scale  and consequently it may be difficult or impossible to apply the second law to it  57  beyond this  the thermodynamics of systems described by the general theory of relativity is beyond the scope of the present article   the theory of classical or equilibrium thermodynamics is idealized  a main postulate or assumption  often not even explicitly stated  is the existence of systems in their own internal states of thermodynamic equilibrium  in general  a region of space containing a physical system at a given time  that may be found in nature  is not in thermodynamic equilibrium  read in the most stringent terms  in looser terms  nothing in the entire universe is or has ever been truly in exact thermodynamic equilibrium  57][58   for purposes of physical analysis  it is often enough convenient to make an assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium  such an assumption may rely on trial and error for its justification  if the assumption is justified  it can often be very valuable and useful because it makes available the theory of thermodynamics  elements of the equilibrium assumption are that a system is observed to be unchanging over an indefinitely long time  and that there are so many particles in a system  that its particulate nature can be entirely ignored  under such an equilibrium assumption  in general  there are no macroscopically detectable fluctuations  there is an exception  the case of critical states  which exhibit to the naked eye the phenomenon of critical opalescence  for laboratory studies of critical states  exceptionally long observation times are needed   in all cases  the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium  once made  implies as a consequence that no putative candidate  fluctuation  alters the entropy of the system   it can easily happen that a physical system exhibits internal macroscopic changes that are fast enough to invalidate the assumption of the constancy of the entropy  or that a physical system has so few particles that the particulate nature is manifest in observable fluctuations  then the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium is to be abandoned  there is no unqualified general definition of entropy for non-equilibrium states  59   there are intermediate cases  in which the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is a very good approximation  60][61][62][63  but strictly speaking it is still an approximation  not theoretically ideal  for non-equilibrium situations in general  it may be useful to consider statistical mechanical definitions of other quantities that may be conveniently called  entropy   but they should not be confused or conflated with thermodynamic entropy properly defined for the second law  these other quantities indeed belong to statistical mechanics  not to thermodynamics  the primary realm of the second law   the physics of macroscopically observable fluctuations is beyond the scope of this article   the second law of thermodynamics is a physical law that is not symmetric to reversal of the time direction   the second law has been proposed to supply an explanation of the difference between moving forward and backwards in time  such as why the cause precedes the effect  the causal arrow of time   64   irreversibility in thermodynamic processes is a consequence of the asymmetric character of thermodynamic operations  and not of any internally irreversible microscopic properties of the bodies  thermodynamic operations are macroscopic external interventions imposed on the participating bodies  not derived from their internal properties  there are reputed  paradoxes  that arise from failure to recognize this   loschmidt s paradox  also known as the reversibility paradox  is the objection that it should not be possible to deduce an irreversible process from the time-symmetric dynamics that describe the microscopic evolution of a macroscopic system   in the opinion of schr xf6dinger   it is now quite obvious in what manner you have to reformulate the law of entropy u2014or for that matter  all other irreversible statements u2014so that they be capable of being derived from reversible models  you must not speak of one isolated system but at least of two  which you may for the moment consider isolated from the rest of the world  but not always from each other   65  the two systems are isolated from each other by the wall  until it is removed by the thermodynamic operation  as envisaged by the law  the thermodynamic operation is externally imposed  not subject to the reversible microscopic dynamical laws that govern the constituents of the systems  it is the cause of the irreversibility  the statement of the law in this present article complies with schr xf6dinger s advice  the cause u2013effect relation is logically prior to the second law  not derived from it   the poincar xe9 recurrence theorem considers a theoretical microscopic description of an isolated physical system  this may be considered as a model of a thermodynamic system after a thermodynamic operation has removed an internal wall  the system will  after a sufficiently long time  return to a microscopically defined state very close to the initial one  the poincar xe9 recurrence time is the length of time elapsed until the return  it is exceedingly long  likely longer than the life of the universe  and depends sensitively on the geometry of the wall that was removed by the thermodynamic operation  the recurrence theorem may be perceived as apparently contradicting the second law of thermodynamics  more obviously  however  it is simply a microscopic model of thermodynamic equilibrium in an isolated system formed by removal of a wall between two systems  for a typical thermodynamical system  the recurrence time is so large  many many times longer than the lifetime of the universe  that  for all practical purposes  one cannot observe the recurrence  one might wish  nevertheless  to imagine that one could wait for the poincar xe9 recurrence  and then re-insert the wall that was removed by the thermodynamic operation  it is then evident that the appearance of irreversibility is due to the utter unpredictability of the poincar xe9 recurrence given only that the initial state was one of thermodynamic equilibrium  as is the case in macroscopic thermodynamics  even if one could wait for it  one has no practical possibility of picking the right instant at which to re-insert the wall  the poincar xe9 recurrence theorem provides a solution to loschmidt s paradox  if an isolated thermodynamic system could be monitored over increasingly many multiples of the average poincar xe9 recurrence time  the thermodynamic behavior of the system would become invariant under time reversal   james clerk maxwell imagined one container divided into two parts  a and b  both parts are filled with the same gas at equal temperatures and placed next to each other  separated by a wall  observing the molecules on both sides  an imaginary demon guards a microscopic trapdoor in the wall  when a faster-than-average molecule from a flies towards the trapdoor  the demon opens it  and the molecule will fly from a to b  the average speed of the molecules in b will have increased while in a they will have slowed down on average  since average molecular speed corresponds to temperature  the temperature decreases in a and increases in b  contrary to the second law of thermodynamics   one response to this question was suggested in 1929 by le xf3 szil xe1rd and later by l xe9on brillouin  szil xe1rd pointed out that a real-life maxwell s demon would need to have some means of measuring molecular speed  and that the act of acquiring information would require an expenditure of energy   maxwell s demon repeatedly alters the permeability of the wall between a and b  it is therefore performing thermodynamic operations on a microscopic scale  not just observing ordinary spontaneous or natural macroscopic thermodynamic processes   the law that entropy always increases holds  i think  the supreme position among the laws of nature  if someone points out to you that your pet theory of the universe is in disagreement with maxwell s equations \u2014 then so much the worse for maxwell s equations  if it is found to be contradicted by observation \u2014 well  these experimentalists do bungle things sometimes  but if your theory is found to be against the second law of thermodynamics i can give you no hope  there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation   there have been nearly as many formulations of the second law as there have been discussions of it   clausius is the author of the sibyllic utterance   the energy of the universe is constant  the entropy of the universe tends to a maximum   the objectives of continuum thermomechanics stop far short of explaining the  universe   but within that theory we may easily derive an explicit statement in some ways reminiscent of clausius  but referring only to a modest object  an isolated body of finite size
