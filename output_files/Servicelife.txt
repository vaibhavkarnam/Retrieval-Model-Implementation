Servicelife
 a product s service life is its period of use in service  it has been defined as  a product s total life in use from the point of sale to the point of discard  and distinguished from replacement life  the period after which the initial purchaser returns to the shop for a replacement   1  determining a product xb4s expected service life as part of business policy involves using tools and calculations from maintainability and reliability analysis  service life represents a commitment made by the item s manufacturer and is usually specified as a median  it is the time that any manufactured item can be expected to be  serviceable  or supported by its manufacturer  citation needed   service life is not to be confused with shelf life  which deals with storage time  or with technical life  which is the maximumn period during which it can physically function  1  it also differs from predicted life  or mttf mtbf  mean time to failure mean time between failures  mfop  maintenance-free operating period   predicted life is useful such that a manufacturer may estimate  by hypothetical modeling and calculation  a general rule for which it will honor warranty claims  or planning for mission fulfillment  the difference between service life and predicted life is most clear when considering mission time and reliability in comparison to mtbf and service life  for example  a missile system can have a mission time of less than one minute  a service life of 20 years  active mtbf of 20 minutes  dormant mtbf of 50 years and a reliability of .999999   consumers will have different expectations about service life and longevity 2][3  based upon factors such as use  cost  and quality       manufacturers will commit to very conservative service life  usually 2 to 5 years for most commercial and consumer products  for example computer peripherals and components   however  for large and expensive durable goods  the items are not consumable  and service lives and maintenance activity will factor large in the service life  again  an airliner might have a mission time of 11 hours  a predicted active mtbf of 10,000 hours with maintenance  or 15,000 hours without maintenance   a reliability of .99999 and a service life of 40 years   the most common model for item lifetime is the bathtub curve  a plot of the varying failure rate as a function of time  during early life  the bathtub shows increased failures  usually witnessed during product development  the middle portion of the bathtub  or  useful life   is a slightly inclined  nearly constant failure rate period where the consumer enjoys the benefit conferred by the product  as the time increases further  the curve reaches a period of increasing failures  modeling the product s wearout phase   for an individual product  the component parts may each have independent service lives  resulting in several bathtub curves  for instance  a tire will have a service life partitioning related to the tread and the casing   for maintainable items  those wear-out items that are determined by logistical analysis to be provisioned for sparing and replacement will assure a longer service life than manufactured items without such planning  a simple example is automotive tires - failure to plan for this wear out item would limit automotive service life to the extent of a single set of tires   an individual tire s life follows the bathtub curve  to boot  after installation  there is a not-small probability of failure which may be related to material or workmanship or even to the process for mounting the tire which may introduce some small damage  after the initial period  the tire will perform  given no defect introducing event such as encountering a road hazard  a nail or a pothole   for a long duration relative to its expected service life which is a function of several variables  design  material  process   after a period  the failure probability will rise  for some tires  this will occur after the tread is worn out  then  a secondary market for tires puts a retread on the tire thereby extending the service life  it is not uncommon for an 80,000-mile tire to perform well beyond that limit  4   it may be difficult to obtain reliable longevity data about many consumer products as  in general  efforts at actuarial analysis are not taken to the same extent as found with that needed to support insurance decisions  however  some attempts to provide this type of information have been made  an example is the collection of estimates for household components provided by the old house web 5  which gathers data from the appliance statistical review and various institutes involved with the homebuilding trade   for certain products  such as those that cannot be serviced during their operational life for technical reasons  a manufacturer may calculate a product s expected performance at both the beginning of operational life  bol  and end of operational life  eol   batteries and other components that degrade over time may affect the operation of a product  the performance of mission critical components is therefore calculated for eol  with the components exceeding their specification at bol  for example  with spaceflight hardware  which must survive in the harsh environment of space  the capacity to generate electricity from solar panels or radioisotope thermoelectric generator is likely to reduce throughout a mission  but must still meet a specific requirement at eol in order to complete the mission  a spacecraft may also have a bol mass that is greater than its eol mass as propellant is depleted during its operational life
