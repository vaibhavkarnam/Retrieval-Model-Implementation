take up badawi s case before his trip  76  his outspoken criticism of saudi justice was unusual for western leaders visiting the country  a close ally for the west in fighting terrorism and islamic state militants  particularly given germany u2019s status as saudi arabia u2019s third-largest source of imports  75  while the u s  state department had previously also criticized the badawi sentence

gabriel u2019s controversial decision to grant a special permission for the country s biggest supermarket chain edeka to buy grocery store chain kaiser s  owned by tengelmann group  the judges raised
