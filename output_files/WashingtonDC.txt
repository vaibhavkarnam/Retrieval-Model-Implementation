 washington  d c   formally the district of columbia and commonly referred to as  washington    the district   or simply  d c    is the capital of the united states   the signing of the residence act on july 16  1790  approved the creation of a capital district located along the potomac river on the country s east coast  the u s  constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the congress and the district is therefore not a part of any state  the states of maryland and virginia each donated land to form the federal district  which included the pre-existing settlements of georgetown and alexandria  named in honor of president george washington  the city of washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital  in 1846  congress returned the land originally ceded by virginia  in 1871  it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the district   washington had an estimated population of 681,170 as of july 2016  commuters from the surrounding maryland and virginia suburbs raise the city s population to more than one xa0million during the workweek  the washington metropolitan area  of which the district is a part  has a population of over 6\xa0million  the sixth-largest metropolitan statistical area in the country   the centers of all three branches of the federal government of the united states are in the district  including the congress  president  and supreme court  washington is home to many national monuments and museums  which are primarily situated on or around the national mall  the city hosts 176 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many international organizations  trade unions  non-profit organizations  lobbying groups  and professional associations   a locally elected mayor and a 13\u2011member council have governed the district since 1973  however  the congress maintains supreme authority over the city and may overturn local laws  d c  residents elect a non-voting  at-large congressional delegate to the house of representatives  but the district has no representation in the senate  the district receives three electoral votes in presidential elections as permitted by the twenty-third amendment to the united states constitution  ratified in 1961       various tribes of the algonquian-speaking piscataway people  also known as the conoy  inhabited the lands around the potomac river when europeans first visited the area in the early 17th century  one group known as the nacotchtank  also called the nacostines by catholic missionaries  maintained settlements around the anacostia river within the present-day district of columbia  conflicts with european colonists and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the piscataway people  some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near point of rocks  maryland  3   in his federalist no  43  published january 23  1788  james madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety  4  five years earlier  a band of unpaid soldiers besieged congress while its members were meeting in philadelphia  known as the pennsylvania mutiny of 1783  the event emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own security  5   article one  section eight  of the constitution permits the establishment of a  district  not exceeding ten xa0miles xa0square  as may  by cession of particular states  and the acceptance of congress  become the seat of the government of the united states   6  however  the constitution does not specify a location for the capital  in what is now known as the compromise of 1790  madison  alexander hamilton  and thomas jefferson came to an agreement that the federal government would pay each state s remaining revolutionary war debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the southern united states  7  a   on july 9  1790  congress passed the residence act  which approved the creation of a national capital on the potomac river  the exact location was to be selected by president george washington  who signed the bill into law on july 16  formed from land donated by the states of maryland and virginia  the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16\xa0km  on each side  totaling 100 square miles (259\xa0km2).[8  b   two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory  the port of georgetown  maryland  founded in 1751,[9  and the city of alexandria  virginia  founded in 1749.[10  during 1791\u201392  andrew ellicott and several assistants  including a free african american astronomer named benjamin banneker  surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point  11  many of the stones are still standing  12   a new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the potomac  to the east of georgetown  on september 9  1791  the three commissioners overseeing the capital s construction named the city in honor of president washington  the federal district was named columbia  which was a poetic name for the united states commonly in use at that time  13][14  congress held its first session in washington on november 17  1800.[15   congress passed the organic act of 1801  which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government  further  the unincorporated area within the district was organized into two counties  the county of washington to the east of the potomac and the county of alexandria to the west  16  after the passage of this act  citizens living in the district were no longer considered residents of maryland or virginia  which therefore ended their representation in congress  17   on august 24\u201325  1814  in a raid known as the burning of washington  british forces invaded the capital during the war of 1812  the capitol  treasury  and white house were burned and gutted during the attack  18  most government buildings were repaired quickly  however  the capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868.[19   in the 1830s  the district s southern territory of alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by congress  20  the city of alexandria was a major market in the american slave trade  and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in congress would end slavery in the district  further depressing the economy  alexandria s citizens petitioned virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district  through a process known as retrocession  21   the virginia general assembly voted in february 1846 to accept the return of alexandria and on july 9  1846  congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by virginia  therefore  the district s current area consists only of the portion originally donated by maryland  20  confirming the fears of pro-slavery alexandrians  the compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district  although not slavery itself  22   the outbreak of the american civil war in 1861 led to expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the district s population  including a large influx of freed slaves  23  president abraham lincoln signed the compensated emancipation act in 1862  which ended slavery in the district of columbia and freed about 3,100 enslaved persons  nine months prior to the emancipation proclamation  24  in 1868  congress granted the district s african american male residents the right to vote in municipal elections  23   by 1870  the district s population had grown 75  from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents  25  despite the city s growth  washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation  some members of congress suggested moving the capital further west  but president ulysses s  grant refused to consider such a proposal  26   congress passed the organic act of 1871  which repealed the individual charters of the cities of washington and georgetown  and created a new territorial government for the whole district of columbia  27  president grant appointed alexander robey shepherd to the position of governor in 1873  shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized washington  but ultimately bankrupted the district government  in 1874  congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member board of commissioners  28   the city s first motorized streetcars began service in 1888 and generated growth in areas of the district beyond the city of washington s original boundaries  washington s urban plan was expanded throughout the district in the following decades  29  georgetown was formally annexed by the city of washington in 1895.[30  however  the city had poor housing conditions and strained public works  washington was the first city in the nation to undergo urban renewal projects as part of the  city beautiful movement  in the early 1900s  31   increased federal spending as a result of the new deal in the 1930s led to the construction of new government buildings  memorials  and museums in washington  32  world war ii further increased government activity  adding to the number of federal employees in the capital  33  by 1950  the district s population reached its peak of 802,178 residents  25   the twenty-third amendment to the united states constitution was ratified in 1961  granting the district three votes in the electoral college for the election of president and vice president  but still no voting representation in congress  34   after the assassination of civil rights leader dr  martin luther king  jr   on april 4  1968  riots broke out in the district  primarily in the u xa0street  14th xa0street  7th xa0street  and h xa0street corridors  centers of black residential and commercial areas  the riots raged for three days until more than 13,600 federal troops stopped the violence  many stores and other buildings were burned  rebuilding was not completed until the late 1990s  35   in 1973  congress enacted the district of columbia home rule act  providing for an elected mayor and 13-member council for the district  36  in 1975  walter washington became the first elected and first black mayor of the district  37   on september 11  2001  terrorists hijacked american airlines flight 77 and deliberately crashed the plane into the pentagon in nearby arlington  virginia  united airlines flight 93  believed to be destined for washington  d c   crashed in pennsylvania when passengers tried to recover control of the plane from hijackers  38][39   washington  d c   is located in the mid-atlantic

natural watercourse that once passed through the national mall  was fully enclosed underground during the 1870s  42  the creek also formed a portion of the now-filled washington city canal  which allowed passage through the city to the anacostia river from 1815 until the 1850s  43  the chesapeake and ohio canal starts in georgetown and was used during the 19th century to bypass the little

official measurements began in 1885.[63  according to notes kept at the time  the city received between 30 and 36 inches (76 and 91\xa0cm  from a snowstorm on january 1772.[64   hurricanes  or their remnants  occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall  but are often weak by the time they reach washington  partly due to the city s inland location  65  flooding of the potomac

capital  he enlisted scottish surveyor alexander ralston helped layout the city plan  72  the l enfant plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles  providing room for open space and landscaping  73  he based his design on plans of cities such as paris  amsterdam  karlsruhe  and milan that thomas jefferson had sent to him  74  l enfant s design also envisioned a garden-lined  grand avenue  approximately 1 mile (1.6\xa0km  in length and 400 feet (120\xa0m  wide in the area that is now the national mall  75   president washington dismissed l enfant in march 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capital s construction  andrew ellicott  who had worked with l enfant surveying the city  was then tasked with completing the design  though ellicott made revisions to the original plans  including changes to some street patterns  l enfant is still credited with the overall design of the city  76   by the early 1900s  l enfant s vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings  including a railroad station on the national mall  congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying washington s ceremonial core  31  what became known as the mcmillan plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the capitol grounds and the national mall  clearing slums  and establishing a new citywide park system  the plan is thought to have largely preserved l enfant s intended design  73   by law  washington s skyline is low and sprawling  the federal heights of buildings act of 1910 allows buildings that are no taller than the width of the adjacent street  plus 20 feet (6.1\xa0m   77  despite popular belief  no law has ever limited buildings to the height of the united states capitol or the 555-foot (169\xa0m  washington monument  49  which remains the district s tallest structure  city leaders have criticized the height restriction as a primary reason why the district has limited affordable housing and traffic problems caused by urban sprawl  77   the district is divided into four quadrants of unequal area  northwest  nw   northeast  ne   southeast  se   and southwest  sw   the axes bounding the quadrants radiate from the u s  capitol building  78  all road names include the quadrant abbreviation to indicate their location and house numbers generally correspond with the number of blocks away from the capitol  most streets are set out in a grid pattern with east u2013west streets named with letters  e g   c street sw   north u2013south streets with numbers  e g   4th street nw   and diagonal avenues  many of which are named after states  78   the city of washington was bordered by boundary street to the north  renamed florida avenue in 1890   rock creek to the west  and the anacostia river to the east  29][73  washington s street grid was extended  where possible  throughout the district starting in 1888.[79  georgetown s streets

washington  notable exceptions include buildings constructed in the french second empire style such as the eisenhower executive office building  83   outside downtown washington  architectural styles are even more varied  historic buildings are designed primarily in the queen anne  ch xe2teauesque  richardsonian romanesque  georgian revival  beaux-arts  and a variety of victorian styles  rowhouses

populous place in the united states as of 2010[update   91  according to data from 2010  commuters from the suburbs increase the district s daytime population to over one million people  92  if the

since the city s foundation  95  african american residents composed about 30  of the district s total population between 1800 and 1940.[25  the black population reached a peak of 70  by 1970  but has since steadily declined due to many african americans moving to the surrounding suburbs  partly as a result of gentrification  there was a 31.4  increase in the non-hispanic white population and an 11.5  decrease in the black population between 2000 and 2010.[96   about 17  of d c  residents were age 18 or younger in 2010  lower than the u s  average of 24   however  at 34 years old  the

report found that about one-third of district residents were functionally illiterate  compared to a national rate of about one in five  this is attributed in part to immigrants who are not proficient

second-highest rate in the nation  this is due in part to city programs that help provide insurance to low-income individuals who do not qualify for other types of coverage  107  a 2009 report found that at least 3  of district residents have hiv or aids  which the centers for disease control and prevention  cdc  characterizes as a  generalized and severe  epidemic  108   crime in washington  d c

affluent neighborhoods of northwest washington are typically safe  but reports of violent crime increase in poorer neighborhoods generally concentrated in the eastern portion of the city  109  approximately 60,000 residents are ex-convicts  110   washington was often described as the  murder capital  of the united states during the early 1990s  111  the number of murders peaked in 1991 at 479  but the level of violence then began to decline significantly  112  by 2012  washington s annual murder count had dropped to 88  the lowest total since 1961.[113  the murder rate has since risen from that historic low  though it remains close to half the rate of the early 2000s  114  in 2016  the district s metropolitan police department tallied 135 homicides  a 53  increase from 2012 but a 17  decrease from 2015.[115  many neighborhoods such as columbia heights and logan circle are becoming safer and vibrant  however  incidents of robberies and thefts have remained higher in these areas because of increased nightlife activity and greater numbers of affluent residents  116  even still  citywide reports of both property and violent crimes have declined by nearly half since their most recent highs in the mid-1990s  117   on june 26  2008  the supreme court of the united states held in district of columbia v  heller that the city s 1976 handgun ban violated the second amendment

itself had an unemployment rate of 9.8  during the same time period  125   in 2012  the federal government accounted for about 29  of the jobs in washington  d c  126  this is thought to immunize washington to national economic downturns because the federal government continues operations even during recessions  127  many organizations such as law firms  independent contractors  both defense and civilian   non-profit organizations  lobbying firms  trade unions  industry trade groups  and professional associations have their headquarters in or near d c  to be close to the federal
