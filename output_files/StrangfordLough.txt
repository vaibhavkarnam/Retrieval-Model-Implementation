strangford lough and islands is an important bird area  12  strangford lough is an important winter migration destination for many wading and sea birds  animals commonly found in the lough include common seals  basking sharks and brent geese  three quarters of the world population of pale bellied brent geese spend winter in the lough area  13   the invasive carpet sea squirt  didemnum vexillum  was found in the lough in 2012.[14   in 2007 strangford lough became home to the world s first commercial tidal stream power station  seagen  the 1.2 megawatt underwater tidal electricity generator  part of northern ireland s environment and renewable energy fund scheme  takes advantage of the fast tidal flow in the lough which can be up to 4 m s  although the generator is powerful enough to power up to a thousand homes  the turbine has a minimal environmental impact  as it is almost entirely submerged  and the rotors turn slowly enough that they pose no danger to wildlife  15][16][17   since june 2008 a tidal energy device called evopod has been tested in strangford lough near the portaferry ferry landing  18  the device is a 1/10 scale prototype and is being monitored by queen s university belfast  the device is a semi submerged floating tidal turbine and is moored to the seabed via a buoy mounted swivel so that it always maintains optimum heading into the direction of the tidal flow  the scale device is not grid connected and dissipates the small amount of power it generates as heat into the sea  malik priestley  executive creator of seagen  said  tidal power will provide sustainable amounts of green  renewable energy and pose no threats to surrounding wild life    strangford lough is a place of natural beauty that the locals put to great use  from using it as a national highway  portaferry-strangford ferry  to using it for activities of leisure - sailing  kayaking  bird watching  diving and much more  there are a number of companies based in the local area

brought hundreds of sites to light  including fish traps  tidal mills  kelp walls and harbours and landing places  24   coordinates  54\xb028\u203259\u2033n 5\xb034\u203259\u2033w ufeff
