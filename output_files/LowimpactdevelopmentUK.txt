 low-impact development  lid  has been defined as  development which through its low negative environmental impact either enhances or does not significantly diminish environmental quality   1][2][3   the interplay between would-be developers and the uk planning authorities since the 1980s has led to a diversity of unique  locally adapted developments  often making use of natural  local and reclaimed materials in delivering highly affordable  low or zero carbon housing  these lids often strive to be self-sufficient in terms of waste management  energy  water and other needs  4   there are numerous examples of lids throughout the uk  and local and national authorities have come to recognise the need for the concept to be incorporated into planning strategies       low-impact development  lid   in the uk sense of the term  was described by simon fairlie  a former editor of the ecologist magazine  in 1996 as   development that through its low impact either enhances or does not significantly diminish environmental quality   5  fairlie later wrote    neither the term nor the concept was new  people have been living low impact lifestyles in low impact buildings for centuries  indeed until very recently the majority of people in the world lived that way   6   in 2009 fairlie revised his definition of a lid as   development which  by virtue of its low or benign environmental impact  may be allowed in locations where conventional development is not permitted   6  he explained    i prefer this revised definition because wrapped up in it is the main argument  that low impact buildings need not be bound by the restrictions necessary to protect the countryside from  conventional  high impact development \u2013 a k a  suburban sprawl  there are two other principle arguments in favour of lid   i  that some form of exception policy is necessary because conventional housing in a countryside protected from sprawl becomes too expensive for the people who work there  and  ii  soon we will all have to live more sustainable low impact lifestyles  so pioneers should be encouraged   6   others have expanded on the definition  a study by the university of west england acknowledged that   lid is usually integrally connected with land management and as much as describing physical development  lid also describes a form of livelihood   7  however  it also states that as lid is a  multi featured and intrinsically integrated form of development   a simple definition cannot capture the meaning of lid and goes on to develop  a detailed themed definition with detailed criteria   7   dr larch maxey 8  in 2013 held the main features of lid to be   english lid examples include the hockerton housing project  nottinghamshire   michael buck s cob house in oxfordshire  9  landmatters (devon  10  and tinker s bubble (somerset   11][12   transition homes  currently under development in transition town totnes  devon  is an attempt to scale-up and mainstream lid by providing around 25 low cost  low carbon homes designed along permaculture principles  13][14][15  residents will be allocated from the local housing needs register  14  similarly  lilac built in 2013 a  low impact living affordable community  of 20 homes and a common house in bramley  leeds  16][17][18  which was visited by kevin mccloud and mark prisk  minister of state for housing and local government  19   bedzed  london  is another example of a larger scale lid  which was built in 2000\u20132002 and has 82 homes  however it is not as affordable as many of the above examples as it was partly designed to attract urban professionals   findhorn ecovillage has won a number of international awards  steve james s straw house  dumfries was built for \xa34,000.[20   the house of the future  cardiff  completed in 2000  was originally a showcase of the latest green building technologies  and later transformed into an education centre  21  in west wales  lammas ecovillage  near crymych  pembrokeshire  is a community of independent  off-grid households begun in 2009.[22][23][24  nearby pwll broga roundhouse is a development that was built without planning permission in 2012  refused retrospective planning permission in 2014,[25][26  but granted permission in july 2015  having met the requirements of the welsh government s one planet development policy  27  that roundhouse  brithdir mawr  newport  pembrokeshire  was granted planning permission in 2008 with a review in 3 years   substantial research has concluded that lid represents some of the most innovative and sustainable development in the uk  7][28][29   lids have innovated and demonstrated sustainable solutions including low zero carbon housing design  rainwater harvesting  renewable energy generation  waste minimisation and innovative forms of land management  including no low-till farming  permaculture and agroforestry   lid has also shown a capacity to enhance local biodiversity and public access to local space  and to produce traffic movements far below the national average  this has been attributed to lift-sharing  to residents  greater use of public transport  walking and cycling and to the integration of local land based employment with other household activities  30  as the welsh assembly government has noted  such     development therefore is not just describing a physical development  it is describing a way of living differently where there is a symbiotic relationship between people and land  making a reduction in environmental impacts possible   31   over the years  there have been various struggles with planning authorities over lid in the uk  tony wrench spent over a decade fighting the planning authorities until he was granted planning permission for that roundhouse  32][33][34][35  as lisa lewinsohn points out in her msc thesis on lid  tony wrench and his partner jane faith have been  enforced against  fined  refused planning permission several times  3  while lammas has  probably spent about \xa350,000 on the application process   3  similarly  since 1986 tir penrhos isaf has tried several times to get planning permission 36  and only succeeded in december 2006  twenty years after their first planning application was submitted  37   the residents of tir penrhos isaf consider    that current planning and building legislation represent some of the greatest obstacles to developing sustainable systems in britain  the legislation favours those who already have land and property  actively encourages the squandering of resources and environmental degradation and actively discourages movements towards low impact  sustainable development   36   the extensive research interest in lid  backed up by the practical examples of the existing lids  has led to a growing number of planning policies in the uk designed to allow for lids  38  these include the dartmoor national park authority s emerging plan on low impact dwellings in the countryside  39  the pembrokeshire low impact development policy  policy 52)[40  and the welsh assembly government u2019s one planet development policy (opd  41][2][42  which is supported by the independent one planet council  43  the first development to receive permanent planning permission under the one planet scheme was nant-y-cwm  near caerphilly  44  the criteria for opd in wales include the requirement that 65  of all subsistence  or 30  of food and 35  of livelihood  come from the land  45
