2012.[29  because his new partner lives in oxford  monbiot had returned there by 2013.[30   in november 2012  he apologised to lord mcalpine for his  stupidity and thoughtlessness  in implying  in a tweet  that the tory peer was a paedophile  31][32][33  in march 2013  monbiot announced on his blog the details of a settlement reached with lord mcalpine s representatives  monbiot agreed  to carry out  over the next three years  work on behalf of three charities of my choice whose value amounts to \xa325,000   which he described as an  unprecedented settlement   34   monbiot believes that drastic action coupled with strong political will is needed to combat global warming  35  monbiot has written that climate change is the  moral question of the 21st century  and that there is an urgent need for a number of emergency actions he believes will stop climate change  including  setting targets on greenhouse emissions using the latest science  issuing every citizen with a  personal carbon ration   new building regulations with houses built to german passivhaus standards  banning incandescent light bulbs  patio heaters  garden floodlights  and other inefficient technologies and wasteful applications  constructing large offshore wind farms  replacing the national gas grid with a hydrogen pipe network  a new national coach network to make journeys using public transport faster than using a car  all petrol stations to supply leasable electric car batteries with stations equipped with a crane service to replace depleted batteries  scrap road-building and road-widening programmes  redirecting their budgets to tackle climate change  reduce uk airport capacity by 90 percent  closing down all out-of-town superstores and replacing them with warehouses and a delivery system  36   monbiot says the campaign against climate change is  unlike almost all the public protests  that came before it   it is a campaign not for abundance but for austerity  it is a campaign not for more freedom but for less  strangest of all  it is a campaign not just against other people  but against ourselves   37   monbiot also thinks that economic recession can be a good thing for the planet   is it not time to recognise that we have reached the promised land  and should seek to stay there  why would we want to leave this place in order to explore the blackened waste of consumer frenzy followed by ecological collapse  surely the rational policy for the governments of the rich world is now to keep growth rates as close to zero as possible   38][39  while he does recognize that recession can cause hardship  he points out that economic growth can cause hardship as well  for example  the increase in sales of jet skis would count as economic growth  but they would also cause hardships such as water pollution and noise pollution  39   monbiot purchased a used diesel renault clio after moving to machynlleth in 2007.[40  he has travelled through canada and the united states  campaigning on climate change and promoting his book  he contends that this travel was justifiable as it sought to boost the case for much greater carbon cuts there  41][42   he is the patron of the uk student campaign network people  amp  planet 43  and appears in the film the age of stupid in animated form  in which he says  the very fact that the crisis is taking place within our generation  it s happening right now  means that we are tremendously powerful people  so this position of despair and  i can t do anything  and  there s no point  is completely illogical  it s exactly the opposite   44][45   monbiot attended the 2009 united nations climate change conference held in copenhagen   monbiot once expressed deep antipathy to the nuclear industry  46  he finally rejected his later neutral position regarding nuclear power in march 2011  although he  still loathe s  the liars who run the nuclear industry   47  monbiot now advocates its use  having been convinced of its relative safety by what he considers the limited effects of the 2011 japan tsunami on nuclear reactors in the region  47  subsequently  he has harshly condemned the anti-nuclear movement  writing that it  has misled the world about the impacts of radiation on human health   made  claims  ungrounded in science  unsupportable when challenged and wildly wrong   he singled out helen caldicott for  he wrote  making unsourced and inaccurate claims  dismissing contrary evidence as part of a cover-up  and overstating the death toll from the chernobyl disaster by a factor of more than 140.[48  in october 2013 monbiot criticized the selection of a generation iii reactor design for the hinkley point c nuclear power station due to cost as well as for a half century requirement of uranium mining and transuranic waste production  he contrasted this with two generation iv reactor concepts   if integral fast reactors were deployed  the uk s stockpile of nuclear waste could be used to generate enough low-carbon energy to meet all uk demand for 500 years  these reactors would keep recycling the waste until hardly any remained  solving three huge problems u2014energy supply  nuclear waste and climate change u2014at once  thorium reactors use an element that s already extracted in large quantities as an unwanted byproduct of other mining industries  they recycle their own waste  leaving almost nothing behind   49   cf  similar comments by james hansen   in 2012  monbiot claimed that there was more than enough oil for  industry and consumer capitalism  to  deep-fry the lot of us   citing a report of 110 million barrels per day in 2020.[50][51   monbiot harshly criticised the book heaven and earth by climate change skeptic ian plimer  saying that  since its publication in australia it has been ridiculed for a hilarious series of schoolboy errors  and its fudging and manipulation of the data   52  plimer challenged monbiot to a public debate on the issues covered in the book  monbiot agreed on the condition that plimer first answer a series of written questions for publication on the website of the guardian  so there would be a factual basis to the discussion  53  plimer refused and monbiot labeled plimer a  grandstander  with a  broad yellow streak  who has nowhere answered the accusations of serious errors in his heaven and earth book  and accused him of trying to  drown out the precise refutations published by his book s reviewers   54  plimer then reversed his decision  and agreed to answer written questions in return for a live debate  55  monbiot s response on receiving plimer s contribution was one of disappointment  on the grounds that plimer s response  so far consists not of answers  but of questions addressed to me   56  monbiot told plimer that he is not qualified to answer plimer s questions 56   although gavin schmidt of nasa did answer them   57  on 2 september 2009  monbiot published another column in the guardian asking   is ian plimer ever going to answer my questions   and suggested that plimer was evading the questions by using the chewbacca defence  58  a debate was subsequently held on 15 december  while monbiot was in copenhagen  on the australian broadcasting corporation s lateline programme  moderated by tony jones  59][60   monbiot made an unsuccessful attempt to carry out a citizen s arrest of john bolton  a former u s  ambassador to the united nations  when the latter attended the hay festival to give a talk on international relations in may 2008  monbiot argued that bolton was one of the instigators of the iraq war  of which monbiot was an opponent  61   he was involved initially with the respect political party  but he broke with the organisation when it chose to run candidates against the green party in the 2004 election to the european parliament  62  in an interview with the british political blog third estate in september 2009  monbiot expressed his support for the policies of plaid cymru  saying  i have finally found the party that i feel very comfortable with  that s not to say i feel uncomfortable with the green party  on the whole i support it  but i feel even more comfortable with plaid   63   in april 2010  he was a signatory to an open letter of support for the liberal democrats  published in the guardian  64  prior to the 2015 uk general election  he was one of several public figures who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the green party s caroline lucas  65   monbiot has been associated with the cause of indigenous rights  and has sought to denounce threats to tribal people  at the face of corporate interests  66][67  he contributed to the 2009 book we are one  a celebration of tribal peoples  68  which explores the culture of peoples around the world  portraying both its diversity and the threats it faces   monbiot s first book was poisoned arrows (1989   a work of investigative travel journalism exposing what he called the  devastating effects  of the partially world bank-funded transmigration program on the peoples and tribes of papua and west papua in indonesia  it was followed by amazon watershed (1991  which documented expulsions of brazilian peasant farmers from their land and followed them thousands of miles across the forest to the territory of the yanomami indians  and showed how timber sold in britain was being stolen from indigenous and biological reserves in brazil  his third book  no man s land  an investigative journey through kenya and tanzania (1994   documented the seizure of land and cattle from nomadic people in kenya and the tanzania  by u2014among other forces u2014game parks and safari tourism   in 2000  he published captive state  the corporate takeover of britain  the book examines the role of corporate power in the united kingdom  on both local and national levels  and argues that corporate involvement in politics is a serious threat to democracy  subjects discussed in the book include the building of the skye bridge  corporate involvement in the national health service  the role of business in university research  and the conditions which influence the granting of planning permission   his fifth book  the age of consent  a manifesto for a new world order  was published in 2003  the book is an attempt to set out a positive manifesto for change for the global justice movement  monbiot criticises anarchism and marxism  arguing that any possible solution to the world s inequalities must be rooted in a democratic parliamentary system  the four main changes to global governance which monbiot argues for are a democratically elected world parliament which would pass resolutions on international issues  a democratised united nations general assembly to replace the unelected un security council  the proposed international clearing union which would automatically discharge trade deficits and prevent the accumulation of debt  and a fair trade organisation which would regulate world trade in a way that protects the economies of poorer countries  69   the book also discusses ways in which these ideas may be put into practice  he posits that the united states and western european states are heavily dependent on the existence of this debt  and that when faced with a choice between releasing the developing world from debt and the collapse of the global economy  their internal economic interests will dictate that they opt for the  soft landing  option  however  monbiot emphasises that he does not present the manifesto as a  final or definitive  answer to global inequalities but intends that it should open debate and stresses that those who reject it must offer their own solutions  he argues that ultimately the global justice movement  must seek   to provide a coherent programme of alternatives to the concentrated power of the dictatorship of vested interests    monbiot s next book  heat  how to stop the planet burning  published in 2006  focuses on the issue of climate change  he points out that the public opinion campaign to cast doubt on the reality of climate change is funded by fossil-fuel companies  primarily exxon-mobil   and traces the  network of fake citizens  groups and bogus scientific bodies  campaigning to discredit climate science to origins in a campaign by tobacco companies to create a facade of science to cast doubt on the link between cigarette smoking and disease  70  he argues that a 90 percent reduction in carbon emissions is necessary in developed countries in order to prevent disastrous changes to the climate  he then sets out to demonstrate how such a reduction could be achieved within the united kingdom  without a significant fall in living standards  through changes in housing  power supply  and transport   feral  searching for enchantment on the frontiers of rewilding was published in 2013  and focuses on the concept of rewilding the planet  monbiot states  rewilding offers a positive environmentalism  environmentalists have long known what they are against  now we can explain what we are for   71   in the book  monbiot attacks sheep farming as  a slow-burning ecological disaster  which has done more damage to the living systems of this country than either climate change or industrial pollution  yet scarcely anyone seems to have noticed   72  he particularly looks at sheep farming in wales   the book received favourable reviews  including in publications normally hostile to his work  such as the spectator 73  and the daily telegraph  72  it won the society of biology book award for general biology in 2014.[74   he has honorary doctorates from the university of st andrews and the university of essex  and an honorary fellowship from cardiff university  20   in 1995  nelson mandela presented him with a united nations global 500 award for outstanding environmental achievement  75  he was a finalist in the lloyds national screenwriting prize 76  with his screenplay the norwegian  and won a sony award for radio production  the sir peter kent award and the oneworld national press award  20  in november 2007 his book heat was awarded the premio mazotti  an italian book prize  but he was denied the money given with the prize because he refused to travel to venice to collect it in person  arguing that it was not a good enough reason to justify flying
