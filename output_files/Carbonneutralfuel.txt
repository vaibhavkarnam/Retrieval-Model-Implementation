Carbonneutralfuel
 carbon-neutral fuels can refer to a variety of energy fuels or energy systems which have no net greenhouse gas emissions or carbon footprint  one class is synthetic fuel  including methane  gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel or ammonia 1   produced from sustainable or nuclear energy used to hydrogenate waste carbon dioxide recycled from power plant flue exhaust gas or derived from carbonic acid in seawater  other types can be produced from renewable energy sources such as wind turbines  solar panels  and hydroelectric power plants  2][3][4][5  such fuels are potentially carbon-neutral because they do not result in a net increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases  6][7  until captured carbon is used for plastics feedstock  carbon neutral fuel synthesis is the primary means of carbon capture and utilization or recycling  8   to the extent that carbon-neutral fuels displace fossil fuels  or if they are produced from waste carbon or seawater carbonic acid  and their combustion is subject to carbon capture at the flue or exhaust pipe  they result in negative carbon dioxide emission and net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere  and thus constitute a form of greenhouse gas remediation  9][10][11  such power to gas carbon-neutral and carbon-negative fuels can be produced by the electrolysis of water to make hydrogen used in the sabatier reaction to produce methane which may then be stored to be burned later in power plants as synthetic natural gas  transported by pipeline  truck  or tanker ship  or be used in gas to liquids processes such as the fischer u2013tropsch process to make traditional fuels for transportation or heating  12][13][14   carbon-neutral fuels are used in germany and iceland for distributed storage of renewable energy  minimizing problems of wind and solar intermittency  and enabling transmission of wind  water  and solar power through existing natural gas pipelines  such renewable fuels could alleviate the costs and dependency issues of imported fossil fuels without requiring either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to hydrogen or other fuels  enabling continued compatible and affordable vehicles  12  a 250 kilowatt synthetic methane plant has been built in germany and it is being scaled up to 10 megawatts  15       carbon-neutral fuels are synthetic hydrocarbons  they can be produced in chemical reactions between carbon dioxide  which can be captured from power plants or the air  and hydrogen  which is created by the electrolysis of water using renewable energy  the fuel  often referred to as electrofuel  stores the energy that was used in the production of the hydrogen  16  coal can also be used to produce the hydrogen  but that would not be a carbon-neutral source  carbon dioxide can be captured and buried  making fossil fuels carbon-neutral  although not renewable  carbon capture from exhaust gas can make carbon-neutral fuels carbon negative  other hydrocarbons can be broken down to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide which could then be stored while the hydrogen is used for energy or fuel  which would also be carbon-neutral  17   the most energy-efficient fuel to produce is methanol  citation needed  which is made from a chemical reaction of a carbon-dioxide molecule with three hydrogen molecules to produce methanol and water  the stored energy can be recovered by burning the methanol in a combustion engine  releasing carbon dioxide  water  and heat  methane can be produced in a similar reaction  more energy can be used to combine methanol or methane into larger hydrocarbon fuel molecules  12   researchers have also suggested using methanol to produce dimethyl ether  this fuel could be used as a substitute for diesel fuel due to its ability to self ignite under high pressure and temperature  it is already being used in some areas for heating and energy generation  it is nontoxic  but must be stored under pressure  18  octane citation needed  and ethanol citation needed  can also be produced from carbon dioxide and hydrogen   all synthetic hydrocarbons are generally produced at temperatures of 200\u2013300\xa0\xb0c  and at pressures of 20 to 50 bar  catalysts are usually used to improve the efficiency of the reaction and create the desired type of hydrocarbon fuel  such reactions are exothermic and use about 3\xa0mol of hydrogen per mole of carbon dioxide involved  they also produce large amounts of water as a byproduct  2   the most economical source of carbon for recycling into fuel is flue-gas emissions from fossil-fuel combustion where it can be obtained for about usd $7.50 per ton  4][7][13  automobile exhaust gas capture has also been seen as economical but would require extensive design changes or retrofitting  19  since carbonic acid in seawater is in chemical equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide  extraction of carbon from seawater has been studied  20][21  researchers have estimated that carbon extraction from seawater would cost about $50 per ton  5  carbon capture from ambient air is more costly  at between $600 and $1000 per ton and is considered impractical for fuel synthesis or carbon sequestration  7][9  direct air capture is less developed than other methods  proposals for this method involve using a caustic chemical to react with carbon dioxide in the air to produce carbonates  these can then be broken down and hydrated to release pure co2 gas and regenerate the caustic chemical  this process requires more energy than other methods because carbon dioxide is at much lower concentrations in the atmosphere than in other sources  12   researchers have also suggested using biomass as a carbon source for fuel production  adding hydrogen to the biomass would reduce its carbon to produce fuel  this method has the advantage of using plant matter to cheaply capture carbon dioxide  the plants also add some chemical energy to the fuel from biological molecules  this may be a more efficient use of biomass than conventional biofuel because it uses most of the carbon and chemical energy from the biomass instead of releasing as much energy and carbon  its main disadvantage is  as with conventional ethanol production  it competes with food production  2   nighttime wind power is considered the most economical form of electrical power with which to synthesize fuel  because the load curve for electricity peaks sharply during the warmest hours of the day  but wind tends to blow slightly more at night than during the day  therefore  the price of nighttime wind power is often much less expensive than any alternative  off-peak wind power prices in high wind penetration areas of the u s  averaged 1.64 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2009  but only 0.71 cents kwh during the least expensive six hours of the day  12  typically  wholesale electricity costs 2 to 5 cents kwh during the day  22  commercial fuel synthesis companies suggest they can produce gasoline for less than petroleum fuels when oil costs more than $55 per barrel  23   the u s  navy estimates that 100 megawatts of electricity can produce 41,000 gallons of jet fuel per day and shipboard production from nuclear power would cost about $6 per gallon  while that was about twice the petroleum fuel cost in 2010  it is expected to be much less than the market price in less than five years if recent trends continue  moreover  since the delivery of fuel to a carrier battle group costs about $8 per gallon  shipboard production is already much less expensive  24   a 250 kilowatt methane synthesis plant was constructed by the center for solar energy and hydrogen research  zsw  at baden-w xfcrttemberg and the fraunhofer society in germany and began operating in 2010  it is being upgraded to 10 megawatts  scheduled for completion in autumn  2012.[25][26   the george olah carbon dioxide recycling plant operated by carbon recycling international in grindav xedk  iceland has been producing 2 million liters of methanol transportation fuel per year from flue exhaust of the svartsengi power station since 2011.[27  it has the capacity to produce 5 million liters per year  28   audi has constructed a carbon-neutral liquefied natural gas  lng  plant in werlte  germany  29  the plant is intended to produce transportation fuel to offset lng used in their a3 sportback g-tron automobiles  and can keep 2,800 metric tons of co2 out of the environment per year at its initial capacity  30   commercial developments are taking place in columbia  south carolina  31  camarillo  california  32  and darlington  england  33  a demonstration project in berkeley  california proposes synthesizing both fuels and food oils from recovered flue gases  34   carbon-neutral fuels might lead to greenhouse gas remediation because carbon dioxide gas would be reused to produce fuel instead of being released into the atmosphere  capturing the carbon dioxide in flue gas emissions from power plants would eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions  although burning the fuel in vehicles would release that carbon because there is no economical way to capture those emissions  12  this approach would reduce net carbon dioxide emission by about 50  if it were used on all fossil fuel power plants  most coal and natural gas power plants have been predicted to be economically retrofittable with carbon dioxide scrubbers for carbon capture to recycle flue exhaust or for carbon sequestration  35][7][10  such recycling is expected to not only cost less than the excess economic impacts of climate change if it were not done  but also to pay for itself as global fuel demand growth and peak oil shortages increase the price of petroleum and fungible natural gas  9][11   capturing co2 directly from the air or extracting carbonic acid from seawater would also reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the environment  and create a closed cycle of carbon to eliminate new carbon dioxide emissions  2  use of these methods would eliminate the need for fossil fuels entirely  assuming that enough renewable energy could be generated to produce the fuel  using synthetic hydrocarbons to produce synthetic materials such as plastics could result in permanent sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere  12   some authorities have recommended producing methanol instead of traditional transportation fuels  it is a liquid at normal temperatures and can be toxic if ingested  methanol has a higher octane rating than gasoline but a lower energy density  and can be mixed with other fuels or used on its own  it may also be used in the production of more complex hydrocarbons and polymers  direct methanol fuel cells have been developed by caltech s jet propulsion laboratory to convert methanol and oxygen into electricity  18  it is possible to convert methanol into gasoline  jet fuel or other hydrocarbons  but that requires additional energy and more complex production facilities  12  methanol is slightly more corrosive than traditional fuels  requiring automobile modifications on the order of usd $100 each to use it  2][36   in 2016  a method using carbon spikes  copper nanoparticles and nitrogen that converts carbon dioxide to ethanol was developed  37   investigation of carbon-neutral fuels has been ongoing for decades  a 1965 report suggested synthesizing methanol from carbon dioxide in air using nuclear power for a mobile fuel depot  38  shipboard production of synthetic fuel using nuclear power was studied in 1977 and 1995.[39][40  a 1984 report studied the recovery of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel plants  41  a 1995 report compared converting vehicle fleets for the use of carbon-neutral methanol with the further synthesis of gasoline  36
