RenewableenergyinBrazil
 renewable energy in brazil accounted for more than 85.4  of the domestically produced electricity used in brazil  according to data from the 2009 national energy balance  conducted by the energy research corporation (epe   1  after the oil shocks of the 1970s  brazil started focusing on developing alternative sources of energy  mainly sugarcane ethanol  its large sugarcane farms helped  in 1985  91  of cars produced that year ran on sugarcane ethanol  the success of flexible-fuel vehicles  introduced in 2003  together with the mandatory e25 blend throughout the country  have allowed ethanol fuel consumption in the country to achieve a 50  market share of the gasoline-powered fleet by february 2008.[2][3   brazil held its first wind-only energy auction in 2009  in a move to diversify its energy portfolio  foreign companies scrambled to take part  in january 2015  a drought in brazil that cut water to the country s hydroelectric dams prompted severe energy shortages  the crisis  which ravaged the country s economy and led to electricity rationing  underscored brazil s pressing need to diversify away from water power  the bidding is expected to lead to the construction of two gigawatts of wind production with an investment of about us 6 billion over the next two years  brazil counts on hydroelectricity for more than 3/4 of its electricity  but authorities are pushing biomass and wind as primary alternatives  wind energy s greatest potential in brazil is during the dry season  so it is considered a hedge against low rainfall and the geographical spread of existing hydro resources  brazil s technical potential for wind energy is 143 gigawatts due to the country s blustery 7,400-km coastline  where most projects are based  the brazilian wind energy association and the government have set a goal of achieving 20 gigawatts of wind energy capacity by 2020 from the current 5 gigawatts (2014).[4  the industry hopes the auction will help kick-start the wind-energy sector  which already accounts for 70  of the total in all of latin america  5       hydroelectric power plants produce almost 80  of the electrical energy consumed in brazil  6  brazil has the third highest potential for hydroelectricity  following russia and china  7   lack of rainfall  investments and increased consumption resulted in electrical energy rationalization  known as black out  in the years 2001 and 2002  the construction of new hydroelectric power plants means environmental impacts as large areas need to be flooded  altering the ecosystem   the construction of hydro plants \u2013 and therefore the construction of dams and lakes \u2013 causes various negative social and environmental impacts and damages   8     built on the paran xe1 river dividing brazil and paraguay  the itaipu dam is the world s second largest hydroelectric power station  the river runs long the border of the two countries  and during the initial diplomatic talks of constructing the dam both countries were suffering from droughts  the original goal was to provide better management and utilization over water resources for the use of irrigation of crops  argentina was also later incorporated in some of the governmental planning and agreements because it is a directly affected  being down stream  by the regulation of the water on the river  if the dam were to completely open the water flow  areas as far south as buenos aires could potentially flood  construction of the dam started in 1975  and the first generator was opened in 1983  today  the dam provides over 75  of paraguay s electric power needs  and meets nearly 25  of brazil s electricity demands  it is estimated that 10,000 locals were displaced by the construction of the dam  and around 40,000 people were hired to help with the construction of the project  many environmental concerns were overlooked when constructing the dam because the dam would produce such a large amount of energy with carbon free emissions  and no unwanted byproducts  such as with nuclear energy   wind power in brazil amounts to an installed capacity of more than 8 gw as of 2015  potential of wind in brazil is more intense from june to december  coinciding with the months of lower rainfall intensity  this puts the wind as a potential supplementary source of energy generated by hydroelectric  9  in 2009  10 projects are under construction  with a capacity of 256 mw  and in 2010  45 began construction to generate 2,139 mw  in several states  the u s  company general electric has one industry in brazil  in the city of campinas  and one partnership with the tecsis in sorocaba  meeting the demand of the new projects  10   while the 2009 united nations climate change conference (cop15  was taking place in copenhagen  brazil s national electric energy agency  aneel  held the country s first ever wind-only energy auction  on december 14  around 1,800 megawatts  mw  were contracted with energy from 71 wind power plants scheduled to be delivered beginning july 1  2012  while focusing domestically on wind-energy generation  brazil is part of a larger international movement toward wind power as a primary source of energy  in fact  wind power has seen the highest expansion rate of all available renewable energy sources  with an average growth of 27  per year since 1990  according to the global wind energy council  gwec    brazil s first wind-energy turbine was installed in fernando de noronha archipelago in 1992  ten years later the government created the program for incentive of alternative electric energy sources  proinfa  to encourage the use of other renewable sources  such as wind power  biomass  and small hydroelectric power stations  pchs   such stations use hydropower  the flagship of brazil s energy matrix  which comprises around three-quarters of brazil s installed energy capacity   high energy production costs  coupled with the advantages of wind power as a renewable  widely available energy source  have led several countries to establish regulatory incentives and direct financial investments to stimulate wind power generation   since the inception of proinfa  brazil s wind energy production has escalated from 22 mw in 2003 to 602 mw in 2009  as part of 36 private projects  another 10 projects are under construction  with a capacity of 256.4 mw  and 45 additional projects have been approved by aneel with an estimated potential of 2,139.7 mw   developing these wind power sources in brazil is helping the country to meet its strategic objectives of enhancing energy security  reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating jobs  the potential for this type of power generation in brazil could reach up to 145,000 mw  according to the 2001 brazilian wind power potential report by the electric energy research centre  cepel    the cost of energy production continues to pose a significant challenge to the growth of wind energy  the price per megawatt hour  mwh  established in brazil s auction of wind power reserve supply is r 189  while the cap defined in bidding for power plants of the madeira river hydroelectricity complex was r 91  uhe jirau  in 2008  and r 122  uhe santo antonio  in 2007  these hydroelectricity prices were marked down by up to 35  in the 2008 and 2007 auctions  the energy supply was negotiated at r 71.4 mwh in the case of jirau  and r 78.9 mwh for the santo antonio plant  11   the total installed photovoltaic power capacity in brazil is estimated to be between 12 and 15 mwp  of which 50  is for telecommunications systems and 50  for rural energy systems  12  it is less than 0.01  of the energy in brazil   brazil has one of the highest solar incidence in the world  13   brazil s ethanol program started in 1975  when soaring oil prices put a chokehold on the economy  sugarcane was an obvious candidate  given brazil s almost endless amount of arable land and favourable climate  14   most cars on the road today in brazil can run on blends of up to 25  ethanol  and motor vehicle manufacturers already produce vehicles designed to run on much higher ethanol blends  most car makers in brazil sell flexible-fuel cars  trucks  and minivans that can use gasoline and ethanol blends ranging from pure gasoline up to 100  ethanol (e100   in 2009  90  of cars produced that year ran on sugarcane ethanol   brazil is the second largest producer of ethanol in the world and is the largest exporter of the fuel  in 2008  brazil produced 454,000 bbl d of ethanol  up from 365,000 in 2007  all gasoline in brazil contains ethanol  with blending levels varying from 20-25   over half of all cars in the country are of the flex-fuel variety  meaning that they can run on 100 percent ethanol or an ethanol-gasoline mixture  according to anp  brazil also produced about 20,000 bbl d of biodiesel in 2008  and the agency has enacted a three-percent blending requirement for domestic diesel sales   the importance of ethanol in brazil s domestic transportation fuels market will only increase in the future  according to petrobr xe1s  ethanol accounts for more than 50 percent of current light vehicle fuel demand  and the company expects this to increase to over 80  by 2020  because ethanol production continues to grow faster than domestic demand  brazil has sought to increase ethanol exports  according to industry sources  brazil s ethanol exports reached 86,000 bbl d in 2008  with 13,000 bbl d going to the united states  brazil is the largest ethanol exporter in the world  holding over 90  of the global export market  15   the center of management and strategic studies under the supervision of the brazilian ministry of science and technology has published a document titled  energetic hydrogen in brazil  funding for competitive politics 2010\u20132025 (\u2018\u2018hidrogenio energetico no brasil  subsidios para pol u0131ticas de competitividade 2010\u20132025\u2019\u2019 in portuguese   giving numbers of a hydrogen scenario in the country related to its research  technologies and funding [45   the document reports brazil as a leader in latin america but yet with an investment in hydrogen technologies of only 3 to 5  of japan  european union  or the united states  national hydrogen production is about 920,000 t (10.2 billion cubic meters  per year with only 1  used as a direct fuel and the other 99  for refining  petrochemical  fertilizers and methanol  16   biomass is a clean energy source used in brazil  it reduces environmental pollution as it uses organic garbage  agricultural remains  wood shaving or vegetal oil  refuse cane  with its high energetic value  has been used to produce electricity  17  more than 1 million people in the country works in the production of biomass  and this energy represents 27  of brazil s energetic matrix  18   the recent interest in converting biomass to electricity comes not only from its potential as a low-cost  indigenous supply of power  but for its potential environmental and developmental benefits  for example  biomass may be a globally important mitigation option to reduce the rate of co2 buildup by sequestering carbon and by displacing fossil fuels  renewably grown biomass contributes only a very small amount of carbon to the atmosphere  locally  plantations can lessen soil erosion  provide a means to restore degraded lands  offset emissions and local impacts from fossil-fired power generation  and  perhaps  reduce demands on existing forests  in addition to the direct power and environmental benefits  biomass energy systems offer numerous other benefits  especially for developing countries  such as brazil  some of these benefits include the employment of underutilized labor and the production of co- and by-products  for example  fuelwood   nearly all of the experiences with biomass for power generation is based on the use of waste and residue fuels  primarily wood wood wastes and agricultural residues   the production of electric power from plantation grown wood is an emerging technology with considerable promise  however  actual commercial use of plantation-grown fuels for power generation is limited to a few isolated experiences  wood from plantations is not an inexpensive energy feedstock  and as long as worldwide prices of coal  oil and gas are relatively low  the establishment of plantations dedicated to supplying electric power or other higher forms of energy will occur only where financial subsidies or incentives exist or where other sources of energy are not available   the biomass plantations are supplying energy on a commercial basis  such as in brazil  the philippines and sweden  it can be shown that a combination of government policies and or high conventional energy prices have stimulated the use of short-rotation plantations for energy  brazil used tax incentives beginning in the mid-1960s to initiate a reforestation program to provide for industrial wood energy and wood product needs  as a consequence of the brazilian forestry code with its favourable tax incentives  the planted forest area in brazil increased from 470,000\xa0ha to 6.5 million ha by 1993  with the discontinuation of the tax incentives in 1988  plantation establishment in brazil has slowed although the commercial feasibility of using eucalyptus for energy and other products has been clearly demonstrated  19
