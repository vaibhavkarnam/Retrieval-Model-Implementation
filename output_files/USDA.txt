state  he began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of the congress and agricultural societies  in 1839  congress established the agricultural division within the patent office and allotted $1,000 for  the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes    ellsworth s interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the new seeds and plants  a clerk to collect agricultural statistics  statewide reports about crops in different regions  and the application of chemistry to agriculture  ellsworth was called the  father of the department of agriculture    in 1849  the patent office was transferred to the newly created department of the interior  in the ensuing years  agitation for a separate bureau of agriculture within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring   on may 15  1862  abraham lincoln established the independent department of agriculture to be headed by a commissioner without cabinet status  and the agriculturalist isaac newton was appointed to be the first such commissioner  5  lincoln called it the  people s department   in the 1880s  varied advocacy groups were lobbying for cabinet representation  business interests sought a department of commerce and industry  and farmers tried to raise the department of agriculture to cabinet rank  in 1887  the house of representatives and senate passed bills giving cabinet status to the department of agriculture and labor  but the bill was defeated in conference committee after farm interests objected to the addition of labor  finally  on february 9  1889  president grover cleveland signed a bill into law elevating the department of agriculture to cabinet level  6   in 1887  the hatch act provided for the federal funding of agricultural experiment stations in each state  the smith-lever act of 1914 then funded

resignation but assigned him additional tasks of combating opioid addiction  a task usually not assigned to the department of agriculture  10   allegations have been made that throughout the agency s history that its personnel have discriminated against farmers of various backgrounds  denying them loans and access to other programs well into the 1990s  11  the effect of this discrimination has been the reduction in the number of african-american farmers in the united states  12  in 1999  the usda settled a class action lawsuit  the pigford case  alleging discrimination against african-american farmers in the late twentieth century  the government s settlement of nearly $1 billion with more than 13,300 farmers was reportedly the largest civil rights claim to date  13  the 2008 farm bill provided for additional farmers to have their claims heard  as 70,000 had filed late in the original program  13  in 2010 the federal government made another $1.2 billion settlement in what is called pigford ii for outstanding claims  14   many black farmers across the nation experienced discrimination in their dealings with in-state usda agencies  across the nation  black farmers alleged  and the usda later agreed  they were denied access to loans and subsidies provided by the government  15  on a national level  farm subsidies that were afforded to white farmers were not afforded to black farmers  16  since they were denied government loans  emergency or disaster assistance  and other aid  many black farmers lost their farms and homes  17   following long-standing concerns  black farmers joined a class action discrimination suit against the usda filed in federal court in 1997.[18  an attorney called it  the most organized  largest civil rights case in the history of the country   19   also in 1997  black farmers from at least five states held protests in front of the usda headquarters in washington  d c  20  protests in front of the usda were a strategy employed in later years as the black farmers sought to keep national attention focused on the plight of the black farmers  representatives of the national black farmers association met with president bill clinton and other administration officials at the white house  and nbfa s president testified before the united states house committee on agriculture  21   in pigford v  glickman  u s  federal district court judge paul l  friedman approved the settlement and consent decree on april 14  1999.[18  the settlement recognized discrimination against 22,363 black farmers but the nbfa would later call the agreement incomplete because more than 70,000 were excluded  22  nevertheless  the settlement was deemed to be the largest-ever civil rights class action settlement in american history  lawyers estimated the value of the settlement to be more than $2 billion  15  some farmers would have their debts forgiven  23  judge friedman appointed a monitor to oversee the settlement  24  farmers in alabama  mississippi  arkansas  and georgia were among those affected by the settlement  25   the nbfa s president was invited to testify before congress on this matter numerous times following the settlement including before the united states senate committee on agriculture on september 12  2000  when he testified that many farmers had not yet received payments and others were left out of the settlement  nbfa asked congress to pass legislation that would ensure a full resolution of the discrimination cases   environmental working group and nbfa issued a report in july 2004 accusing the usda of withholding nearly three out of every four dollars in the multibillion-dollar settlement of discrimination cases  26  the report says that the u s  department of justice and the usda pursued a path of  willful obstruction of justice  in blocking many of the cases  it was later revealed that one doj staff  general attorney  was unlicensed while she was handling black farmers  cases  27  nbfa called for all those cases to be reheard   in 2006 the government accountability office  gao  issued a report highly critical of the usda in its handling of the black farmers cases  28   nbfa continued to lobby congress to provide relief  nbfa s boyd secured congressional support for legislation that would provide $100 million in funds to settle late-filer cases  in 2006 a bill was introduced into the house of representatives and later the senate by senator george felix allen  29   in 2007 boyd testified before the united states house committee on the judiciary about this legislation   as the organization was making headway by gathering congressional supporters in 2007 it was revealed that some usda farm services agency employees were engaged in activities aimed at blocking congressional legislation that would aid the black farmers  30   president barack obama  then a u s  senator  lent his support to the black farmers  issues in 2007.[31  a bill cosponsored by obama passed the senate in 2007.[32   the senate and house versions of the black farmers bill  reopening black farmers discrimination cases  became law in 2008.[33  the new law could affect up to 74,000 black farmers according to some news reports  34   in 2008 hundreds of black farmers  denied a chance to have their cases heard in the pigford settlement  filed a new lawsuit against usda  35   in 2008  the gao issued a report criticizing the usda s handling of discrimination complaints  36  the gao recommended an oversight review board to examine civil rights complaints  37   after numerous public rallies and an intensive nbfa member lobbying effort  congress approved and obama signed into law in december 2010 legislation that set aside $1.15 billion to resolve the outstanding black farmers cases  38  nbfa s john w  boyd  jr   attended the bill-signing ceremony at the white house   as of 2013  90,000 african-american  hispanic  female and native american farmers had filed claims  some fraudulent  or even transparently bogus  lack of documentation is an issue complicated by the usda practice of discarding denied applications after three years  in maple hill  north carolina  the number of successful claimants was four times the number of farms with 1 out of 9 african-americans being paid  39   the result of such longstanding discrimination is that black farmers have been forced out of business at a rate three times faster than white farmers  in 1920  1 in 7 u s  farmers was african-american  and now the number is 1 in 100  usda spokesman ed loyd  when acknowledging that the usda loan process was unfair to minority farmers  has claimed it is hard to determine the effect on such farmers  40   important legislation setting policy of the usda includes the
