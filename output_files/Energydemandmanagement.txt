Energydemandmanagement
 energy demand management  also known as demand-side management  dsm  or demand-side response (dsr   1  is the modification of consumer demand for energy through various methods such as financial incentives 2  and behavioral change through education  usually  the goal of demand side management is to encourage the consumer to use less energy during peak hours  or to move the time of energy use to off-peak times such as nighttime and weekends  3  peak demand management does not necessarily decrease total energy consumption  but could be expected to reduce the need for investments in networks and or power plants for meeting peak demands  an example is the use of energy storage units to store energy during off-peak hours and discharge them during peak hours  4  a newer application for dsm is to aid grid operators in balancing intermittent generation from wind and solar units  particularly when the timing and magnitude of energy demand does not coincide with the renewable generation  5][6   the american electric power industry originally relied heavily on foreign energy imports  whether in the form of consumable electricity or fossil fuels that were then used to produce electricity  during the time of the energy crises in the 1970s  the federal government passed the public utility regulatory policy act  purpa   hoping to reduce dependence on foreign oil and to promote energy efficiency and alternative energy sources  this act enforced utilities to obtain the cheapest possible power from independent power producers  which in turn promoted renewables and encouraged the utility to reduce the amount of power they need  hence pushing forward agendas for energy efficiency and demand management  7   the term dsm was coined following the time of the 1973 energy crisis and 1979 energy crisis  8  governments of many countries mandated performance of various programs for demand management  an early example is the national energy conservation policy act of 1978 in the u s   preceded by similar actions in california and wisconsin  demand side management was introduced publicly by electric power research institute  epri  in the 1980s  9  nowadays  dsm technologies become increasingly feasible due to the integration of information and communications technology and the power system  new terms such as integrated demand-side management  idsm   or smart grid       electricity use can vary dramatically on short and medium time frames  largely dependent on weather patterns  generally the wholesale electricity system adjusts to changing demand by dispatching additional or less generation  however  during peak periods  the additional generation is usually supplied by less efficient   peaking   sources  unfortunately  the instantaneous financial and environmental cost of using these  peaking  sources is not necessarily reflected in the retail pricing system  in addition  the ability or willingness of electricity consumers to adjust to price signals by altering demand  elasticity of demand  may be low  particularly over short time frames  in many markets  consumers  particularly retail customers  do not face real-time pricing at all  but pay rates based on average annual costs or other constructed prices   energy demand management activities attempt to bring the electricity demand and supply closer to a perceived optimum  and help give electricity end users benefits for reducing their demand  in the modern system  the integrated approach to demand side management is becoming increasingly common  idsm automatically sends signals to end-use systems to shed load depending on system conditions  this allows for very precise tuning of demand to ensure that it matches supply at all times  reduces capital expenditures for the utility  critical system conditions could be peak times  or in areas with levels of variable renewable energy  during times when demand must be adjusted upward to avoid over generation or downward to help with ramping needs   in general  adjustments to demand can occur in various ways  through responses to price signals  such as permanent differential rates for evening and day times or occasional highly priced usage days  behavioral changes achieved through home area networks  automated controls such as with remotely controlled air-conditioners  or with permanent load adjustments with energy efficient appliances   demand for any commodity can be modified by actions of market players and government  regulation and taxation   energy demand management implies actions that influence demand for energy  dsm is originally adopted in electricity  today dsm is applied widely to utility including water and gas as well   reducing energy demand is contrary to what both energy suppliers and governments have been doing during most of the modern industrial history  whereas real prices of various energy forms have been decreasing during most of the industrial era  due to economies of scale and technology  the expectation for the future is the opposite  previously  it was not unreasonable to promote energy use as more copious and cheaper energy sources could be anticipated in the future or the supplier had installed excess capacity that would be made more profitable by increased consumption   in centrally planned economies subsidizing energy was one of the main economic development tools  subsidies to the energy supply industry are still common in some countries   contrary to the historical situation  energy prices and availability are expected to deteriorate  governments and other public actors  if not the energy suppliers themselves  are tending to employ energy demand measures that will increase the efficiency of energy consumption   broadly  demand side management can be classified into four categories  national scale  utility scale  community scale  and individual household scale   energy efficiency improvement is one of the most important demand side management strategies  15  efficiency improvements can be implemented nationally through legislation and standards in housing  building  appliances  transport  machinaries etc   during peak demand time  utilities are able to control storage water heaters and pool pumps in large areas to reduce peak demand  e g  australia and switzerland  one of the common technologies is ripple control  high frequency signal  e g  1000\xa0hz  is superimposed to normal electricity (50 or 60\xa0hz  to switch on or off devices  16   other names can be neighborhood  precinct  or district  community central heating systems have been existing for many decades in regions of cold winters  demand side management can be implemented in community scale to reduce peak demand for heating or cooling  17  [18 another aspect is to achieve net zero energy community   in areas of australia  more than 30  (2016  of households have rooftop photo-voltaic systems  it is useful for them to use free energy from the sun to reduce energy import from the grid  further  demand side management can be helpful when a systematic approach is considered  the operation of photovoltaic  air conditioner  battery energy storage systems  storage water heaters  building performance and energy efficiency measures   the utility companies in the state of queensland  australia have devices fitted onto certain household appliances such as air conditioners or into household meters to control water heater  pool pumps etc  these devices would allow energy companies to remotely cycle the use of these items during peak hours  their plan also includes improving the efficiency of energy-using items  encouraging the use of oil instead of electricity  and giving financial incentives to consumers who use electricity during off-peak hours  when it is less expensive for energy companies to produce  19   another example is that with demand side management  southeast queensland households can use electricity from rooftop photo-voltaic system to heat up water  20   in 2008  toronto hydro  the monopoly energy distributor of ontario  had over 40,000 people signed up to have remote devices attached to air conditioners which energy companies use to offset spikes in demand  spokeswoman tanya bruckmueller says that this program can reduce demand by 40 megawatts during emergency situations  21   california has several demand side management programs  including automated and critical peak pricing demand response programs for commercial and industrial customers as well as residential consumers  energy efficiency rebates  non-event based time-of-use pricing  special electric vehicle charging rates  and distributed storage  some of these programs are slated to be added into the wholesale electricity market to be bid as  supply side  resources that can be dispatched by the system operator  demand side management in the state will be increasingly important as the level of renewable generation approaches 33  by 2020  and is expected to be increased beyond that level in the long-term   the aloca s warrick operation is participating in miso as a qualified demand response resource  which means it is providing demand response in terms of energy  spinning reserve  and regulation service  22][23   demand-side management can apply to electricity system based on thermal power plants or to systems where renewable energy  as hydroelectricity  is predominant but with a complementary thermal generation  for instance  in brazil   in brazil u2019s case  despite the generation of hydroelectric power corresponds to more than 80  of the total  to achieve a practical balance in the generation system  the energy generated by hydroelectric plants supplies the consumption below the peak demand  peak generation is supplied by the use of fossil-fuel power plants  in 2008  brazilian consumers paid more than u 1 billion 24  for complementary thermoelectric generation not previously programmed   in brazil  the consumer pays for all the investment to provide energy  even if a plant sits idle  for most fossil-fuel thermal plants  the consumers pay for the  fuels  and others operation costs only when these plants generate energy  the energy  per unit generated  is more expensive from thermal plants than from hydroelectric  only a few of the brazilian s thermoelectric plants use natural gas  so they pollute significantly more  the power generated to meet the peak demand has higher costs u2014both investment and operating costs u2014and the pollution has a significant environmental cost and potentially  financial and social liability for its use  thus  the expansion and the operation of the current system is not as efficient as it could be using demand side management  the consequence of this inefficiency is an increase in energy tariffs     passed on to the consumers   moreover  because electric energy is generated and consumed almost instantaneously  all the facilities  as transmission lines and distribution nets  are built for peak consumption  during the non-peak periods their full capacity is not utilized   the reduction of peak consumption can benefit the efficiency of the electric systems  like the brazilian system  in some senses  as deferring new investments in distribution and transmission networks  and reducing the necessity of complementary thermal power operation during peak periods  which can diminish both the payment for investment in new power plants to supply only during the peak period and the environmental impact associated with greenhouse gas emission   some people argue that demand-side management has been ineffective because it has often resulted in higher utility costs for consumers and less profit for utilities  25   one of the main goals of demand side management is to be able to charge the consumer based on the true price of the utilities at that time  if consumers could be charged less for using electricity during off-peak hours  and more during peak hours  then supply and demand would theoretically encourage the consumer to use less electricity during peak hours  thus achieving the main goal of demand side management   another problem of dsm is privacy  the consumers have to provide some information about their usage of electricity to their electricity company  this is less of a problem now as people are used to suppliers noting purchasing patterns through mechanisms such as  loyalty cards
