Environmentaltechnology
 environmental technology  envirotech   green technology  greentech  or clean technology  cleantech  is the application of one or more of environmental science  green chemistry  environmental monitoring and electronic devices to monitor  model and conserve the natural environment and resources  and to curb the negative impacts of human involvement  the term is also used to describe sustainable energy generation technologies such as photovoltaics  wind turbines  bioreactors  etc  sustainable development is the core of environmental technologies  the term environmental technologies is also used to describe a class of electronic devices that can promote sustainable management of resources       renewable energy is the energy that can be replenished easily  for years we have been using sources such as wood  sun  water  etc  for means for producing energy  energy that can be produced by natural objects like wood  sun  wind  etc  is considered to be renewable   water purification  the whole idea concept of having dirt germ pollution free water flowing throughout the environment  many other phenomena lead from this concept of purification of water  water pollution is the main enemy of this concept  and various campaigns and activists have been organized around the world to help purify water  1   air purification  basic and common green plants can be grown indoors to keep air fresh because all plants remove co2 and convert it into oxygen  the best examples are  dypsis lutescens  sansevieria trifasciata  and epipremnum aureum  2   sewage treatment is conceptually similar to water purification  sewage treatments are very important as they purify water per levels of its pollution  the most polluted water is not used for anything  and the least polluted water is supplied to places where water is used affluently  it may lead to various other concepts of environmental protection  sustainability etc  3   environmental remediation is the removal of pollutants or contaminants for the general protection of the environment  this is accomplished by various chemical  biological  and bulk movements   encyclopedia of medical concepts  4   solid waste management is the purification  consumption  reuse  disposal and treatment of solid waste that is undertaken by the government or the ruling bodies of a city town  5   egain forecasting is a method using forecasting technology to predict the future weather s impact on a building  6  by adjusting the heat based on the weather forecast  the system eliminates redundant use of heat  thus reducing the energy consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases  7   energy conservation is the utilization of devices that require smaller amounts of energy in order to reduce the consumption of electricity  reducing the use of electricity causes less fossil fuels to be burned to provide that electricity   principles   scientists continue to search for clean energy alternatives to our current power production methods  some technologies such as anaerobic digestion produce renewable energy from waste materials  the global reduction of greenhouse gases is dependent on the adoption of energy conservation technologies at industrial level as well as this clean energy generation  that includes using unleaded gasoline  solar energy and alternative fuel vehicles  including plug-in hybrid and hybrid electric vehicles   since industrial use of energy accounts for 51  of worldwide energy usage 8  improving energy efficiency in this field is a top priority for environmental technology companies around the globe  advanced energy efficient electric motor  and electric generator  technology that are cost effective to encourage their application  such as the brushless wound-rotor doubly fed electric machine and energy saving module  can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (co2  and sulfur dioxide (so2  that would otherwise be introduced to the atmosphere  if electricity is generated using fossil fuels  greasestock is an event held yearly in yorktown heights  new york which is one of the largest showcases of environmental technology in the united states  9][10][11][12][13   courses aimed at developing graduates with specific skills in environmental systems or environmental technology are becoming more common and fall into three broads classes
