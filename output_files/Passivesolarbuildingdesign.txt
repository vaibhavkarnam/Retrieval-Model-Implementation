Passivesolarbuildingdesign
 in passive solar building design  windows  walls  and floors are made to collect  store  and distribute solar energy in the form of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer  this is called passive solar design because  unlike active solar heating systems  it does not involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices  1   the key to design a passive solar building is to best take advantage of the local climate performing an accurate site analysis  elements to be considered include window placement and size  and glazing type  thermal insulation  thermal mass  and shading  2  passive solar design techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings  but existing buildings can be adapted or  retrofitted        passive solar technologies use sunlight without active mechanical systems  as contrasted to active solar   such technologies convert sunlight into usable heat  in water  air  and thermal mass   cause air-movement for ventilating  or future use  with little use of other energy sources  a common example is a solarium on the equator-side of a building  passive cooling is the use of the same design principles to reduce summer cooling requirements   some passive systems use a small amount of conventional energy to control dampers  shutters  night insulation  and other devices that enhance solar energy collection  storage  and use  and reduce undesirable heat transfer   passive solar technologies include direct and indirect solar gain for space heating  solar water heating systems based on the thermosiphon  use of thermal mass and phase-change materials for slowing indoor air temperature swings  solar cookers  the solar chimney for enhancing natural ventilation  and earth sheltering   more widely  passive solar technologies include the solar furnace  but this typically requires some external energy for aligning their concentrating mirrors or receivers  and historically have not proven to be practical or cost effective for widespread use   low-grade  energy needs  such as space and water heating  have proven over time to be better applications for passive use of solar energy   the scientific basis for passive solar building design has been developed from a combination of climatology  thermodynamics  particularly heat transfer  conduction  heat   convection  and electromagnetic radiation   fluid mechanics natural convection  passive movement of air and water without the use of electricity  fans or pumps   and human thermal comfort based on heat index  psychrometrics and enthalpy control for buildings to be inhabited by humans or animals  sunrooms  solariums  and greenhouses for raising plants   specific attention is divided into  the site  location and solar orientation of the building  local sun path  the prevailing level of insolation  latitude sunshine clouds precipitation   design and construction quality materials  placement size type of windows and walls  and incorporation of solar-energy-storing thermal mass with heat capacity   while these considerations may be directed toward any building  achieving an ideal optimized cost performance solution requires careful  holistic  system integration engineering of these scientific principles  modern refinements through computer modeling  such as the comprehensive u s  department of energy  energy plus  3  building energy simulation software   and application of decades of lessons learned  since the 1970s energy crisis  can achieve significant energy savings and reduction of environmental damage  without sacrificing functionality or aesthetics  4  in fact  passive-solar design features such as a greenhouse sunroom solarium can greatly enhance the livability  daylight  views  and value of a home  at a low cost per unit of space   much has been learned about passive solar building design since the 1970s energy crisis  many unscientific  intuition-based expensive construction experiments have attempted and failed to achieve zero energy - the total elimination of heating-and-cooling energy bills   passive solar building construction may not be difficult or expensive  using off-the-shelf existing materials and technology   but the scientific passive solar building design is a non-trivial engineering effort that requires significant study of previous counter-intuitive lessons learned  and time to enter  evaluate  and iteratively refine the simulation input and output   one of the most useful post-construction evaluation tools has been the use of thermography using digital thermal imaging cameras for a formal quantitative scientific energy audit  thermal imaging can be used to document areas of poor thermal performance such as the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day   the scientific lessons learned over the last three decades have been captured in sophisticated comprehensive building energy simulation computer software systems  like u s  doe energy plus    scientific passive solar building design with quantitative cost benefit product optimization is not easy for a novice  the level of complexity has resulted in ongoing bad-architecture  and many intuition-based  unscientific construction experiments that disappoint their designers and waste a significant portion of their construction budget on inappropriate ideas  5   the economic motivation for scientific design and engineering is significant  if it had been applied comprehensively to new building construction beginning in 1980  based on 1970s lessons learned   america could be saving over $250,000,000 per year on expensive energy and related pollution today  5   since 1979  passive solar building design has been a critical element of achieving zero energy by educational institution experiments  and governments around the world  including the u s  department of energy  and the energy research scientists that they have supported for decades  the cost effective proof of concept was established decades ago  but cultural assimilation into architecture  construction trades  and building-owner decision making has been very slow and difficult to change  5   the new terms  architectural science  and  architectural technology  are being added to some schools of architecture  with a future goal of teaching the above scientific and energy-engineering principles  citation needed   the ability to achieve these goals simultaneously is fundamentally dependent on the seasonal variations in the sun s path throughout the day   this occurs as a result of the inclination of the earth s axis of rotation in relation to its orbit  the sun path is unique for any given latitude   in northern hemisphere non-tropical latitudes farther than 23.5 degrees from the equator   the converse is observed in the southern hemisphere  but the sun rises to the east and sets toward the west regardless of which hemisphere you are in   in equatorial regions at less than 23.5 degrees  the position of the sun at solar noon will oscillate from north to south and back again during the year  7   in regions closer than 23.5 degrees from either north-or-south pole  during summer the sun will trace a complete circle in the sky without setting whilst it will never appear above the horizon six months later  during the height of winter  8   the 47-degree difference in the altitude of the sun at solar noon between winter and summer forms the basis of passive solar design  this information is combined with local climatic data  degree day  heating and cooling requirements to determine at what time of the year solar gain will be beneficial for thermal comfort  and when it should be blocked with shading  by strategic placement of items such as glazing and shading devices  the percent of solar gain entering a building can be controlled throughout the year   one passive solar sun path design problem is that although the sun is in the same relative position six weeks before  and six weeks after  the solstice  due to  thermal lag  from the thermal mass of the earth  the temperature and solar gain requirements are quite different before and after the summer or winter solstice  movable shutters  shades  shade screens  or window quilts can accommodate day-to-day and hour-to-hour solar gain and insulation requirements   careful arrangement of rooms completes the passive solar design  a common recommendation for residential dwellings is to place living areas facing solar noon and sleeping quarters on the opposite side  9  a heliodon is a traditional movable light device used by architects and designers to help model sun path effects  in modern times  3d computer graphics can visually simulate this data  and calculate performance predictions  4   personal thermal comfort is a function of personal health factors  medical  psychological  sociological and situational   ambient air temperature  mean radiant temperature  air movement  wind chill  turbulence  and relative humidity  affecting human evaporative cooling   heat transfer in buildings occurs through convection  conduction  and thermal radiation through roof  walls  floor and windows  10   convective heat transfer can be beneficial or detrimental  uncontrolled air infiltration from poor weatherization   weatherstripping   draft-proofing can contribute up to 40  of heat loss during winter  11  however  strategic placement of operable windows or vents can enhance convection  cross-ventilation  and summer cooling when the outside air is of a comfortable temperature and relative humidity  12  filtered energy recovery ventilation systems may be useful to eliminate undesirable humidity  dust  pollen  and microorganisms in unfiltered ventilation air   natural convection causing rising warm air and falling cooler air can result in an uneven stratification of heat  this may cause uncomfortable variations in temperature in the upper and lower conditioned space  serve as a method of venting hot air  or be designed in as a natural-convection air-flow loop for passive solar heat distribution and temperature equalization  natural human cooling by perspiration and evaporation may be facilitated through natural or forced convective air movement by fans  but ceiling fans can disturb the stratified insulating air layers at the top of a room  and accelerate heat transfer from a hot attic  or through nearby windows  in addition  high relative humidity inhibits evaporative cooling by humans   the main source of heat transfer is radiant energy  and the primary source is the sun  solar radiation occurs predominantly through the roof and windows  but also through walls   thermal radiation moves from a warmer surface to a cooler one  roofs receive the majority of the solar radiation delivered to a house  a cool roof  or green roof in addition to a radiant barrier can help prevent your attic from becoming hotter than the peak summer outdoor air temperature 13   see albedo  absorptivity  emissivity  and reflectivity    windows are a ready and predictable site for thermal radiation  14  energy from radiation can move into a window in the day time  and out of the same window at night  radiation uses photons to transmit electromagnetic waves through a vacuum  or translucent medium  solar heat gain can be significant even on cold clear days  solar heat gain through windows can be reduced by insulated glazing  shading  and orientation  windows are particularly difficult to insulate compared to roof and walls  convective heat transfer through and around window coverings also degrade its insulation properties  14  when shading windows  external shading is more effective at reducing heat gain than internal window coverings  14   western and eastern sun can provide warmth and lighting  but are vulnerable to overheating in summer if not shaded  in contrast  the low midday sun readily admits light and warmth during the winter  but can be easily shaded with appropriate length overhangs or angled louvres during summer and leaf bearing summer shade trees which shed their leaves in the fall  the amount of radiant heat received is related to the location latitude  altitude  cloud cover  and seasonal   hourly angle of incidence  see sun path and lambert s cosine law    another passive solar design principle is that thermal energy can be stored in certain building materials and released again when heat gain eases to stabilize diurnal  day night  temperature variations  the complex interaction of thermodynamic principles can be counterintuitive for first-time designers  precise computer modeling can help avoid costly construction experiments   the precise amount of equator-facing glass and thermal mass should be based on careful consideration of latitude  altitude  climatic conditions  and heating cooling degree day requirements   factors that can degrade thermal performance   technically  psh is highly efficient  direct-gain systems can utilize  i e  convert into  useful  heat  65-70  of the energy of solar radiation that strikes the aperture or collector   passive solar fraction  psf  is the percentage of the required heat load met by psh and hence represents potential reduction in heating costs  retscreen international has reported a psf of 20-50   within the field of sustainability  energy conservation even of the order of 15  is considered substantial   other sources report the following psfs   in favorable climates such as the southwest united states  highly optimized systems can exceed 75  psf  20   for more information see solar air heat  there are three primary passive solar energy configurations  21   in a direct-gain passive solar system  the indoor space acts as a solar collector  heat absorber  and distribution system  south-facing glass in the northern hemisphere north-facing in the southern hemisphere  admits solar energy into the building interior where it directly heats  radiant energy absorption  or indirectly heats  through convection  thermal mass in the building such as concrete or masonry floors and walls  the floors and walls acting as thermal mass are incorporated as functional parts of the building and temper the intensity of heating during the day  at night  the heated thermal mass radiates heat into the indoor space  21   in cold climates  a sun-tempered building is the most basic type of direct gain passive solar configuration that simply involves increasing  slightly  the south-facing glazing area  without adding additional thermal mass  it is a type of direct-gain system in which the building envelope is well insulated  is elongated in an east u2013west direction  and has a large fraction (~80  or more  of the windows on the south side  it has little added thermal mass beyond what is already in the building  i e   just framing  wall board  and so forth   in a sun-tempered building  the south-facing window area should be limited to about 5 to 7  of the total floor area  less in a sunny climate  to prevent overheating  additional south-facing glazing can be included only if more thermal mass is added  energy savings are modest with this system  and sun tempering is very low cost  21   in genuine direct gain passive solar systems  sufficient thermal mass is required to prevent large temperature fluctuations in indoor air  more thermal mass is required than in a sun tempered building  overheating of the building interior can result with insufficient or poorly designed thermal mass  about one-half to two-thirds of the interior surface area of the floors  walls and ceilings must be constructed of thermal storage materials  thermal mass can be concrete  adobe  brick  and water thermal mass in floors and walls should be kept keep as bare as is functionally and aesthetically possible  thermal mass needs to be exposed to direct sunlight  wall-to-wall carpeting  large throw rugs  expansive furniture  and large wall hangings should be avoided   typically  for about every 1\xa0ft2 of south-facing glass  about 5 to 10\xa0ft3 of thermal mass is required for thermal mass (1 m3 per 5 to 10 m2   when accounting for minimal-to-average wall and floor coverings and furniture  this typically equates to about 5 to 10\xa0ft2 per ft2 (5 to 10 m2 per m2  of south-facing glass  depending upon whether the sunlight strikes the surface directly  the simplest rule of thumb is that thermal mass area should have an area of 5 to 10 times the surface area of the direct-gain collector  glass  area  21   solid thermal mass  e g   concrete  masonry  stone  etc   should be relatively thin  no more than about 4 in (100\xa0mm  thick  thermal masses with large exposed areas and those in direct sunlight for at least part of the day (2 hour minimum  perform best  medium-to-dark  colors with high absorptivity  should be used on surfaces of thermal mass elements that will be in direct sunlight  thermal mass that is not in contact with sunlight can be any color  lightweight elements  e g   drywall walls and ceilings  can be any color  covering the glazing with tight-fitting  moveable insulation panels during dark  cloudy periods and nighttime hours will greatly enhance performance of a direct-gain system  water contained within plastic or metal containment and placed in direct sunlight heats more rapidly and more evenly than solid mass due to natural convection heat transfer  the convection process also prevents surface temperatures from becoming too extreme as they sometimes do when dark colored solid mass surfaces receive direct sunlight   depending on climate and with adequate thermal mass  south-facing glass area in a direct gain system should be limited to about 10 to 20  of the floor area  e g   10 to 20\xa0ft2 of glass for a 100\xa0ft2 floor area   this should be based on the net glass or glazing area  note that most windows have a net glass glazing area that is 75 to 85  of the overall window unit area  above this level  problems with overheating  glare and fading of fabrics are likely  21   in an indirect-gain passive solar system  the thermal mass  concrete  masonry  or water  is located directly behind the south-facing glass and in front of the heated indoor space and so there is no direct heating the position of the mass prevents sunlight from entering the indoor space and can also obstruct the view through the glass  there are two types of indirect gain systems  thermal storage wall systems and roof pond systems  21   thermal storage  trombe  walls  in a thermal storage wall system  often called a trombe wall  a massive wall is located directly behind south-facing glass  which absorbs solar energy and releases it selectively towards the building interior at night  the wall can be constructed of cast-in-place concrete  brick  adobe  stone  or solid  or filled  concrete masonry units  sunlight enters through the glass and is immediately absorbed at the surface of the mass wall and either stored or conducted through the material mass to the inside space  the thermal mass cannot absorb solar energy as fast as it enters the space between the mass and the window area  temperatures of the air in this space can easily exceed 120\xa0\xb0f (49\xa0\xb0c   this hot air can be introduced into interior spaces behind the wall by incorporating heat-distributing vents at the top of the wall  this wall system was first envisioned and patented in 1881 by its inventor  edward morse  felix trombe  for whom this system is sometimes named  was a french engineer who built several homes using this design in the french pyrenees in the 1960s   a thermal storage wall typically consists of a 4 to 16 in (100 to 400\xa0mm  thick masonry wall coated with a dark  heat-absorbing finish  or a selective surface  and covered with a single or double layer of high transmissivity glass  the glass is typically placed from  xbe in to 2 in from the wall to create a small airspace  in some designs  the mass is located 1 to 2\xa0ft (0.6 m  away from the glass  but the space is still not usable  see photos 16.20 and 16.21  the surface of the thermal mass absorbs the solar radiation that strikes it and stores it for nighttime use  unlike a direct gain system  the thermal storage wall system provides passive solar heating without excessive window area and glare in interior spaces  however  the ability to take advantage of views and daylighting are eliminated  the performance of trombe walls is diminished if the wall interior is not open to the interior spaces  furniture  bookshelves and wall cabinets installed on the interior surface of the wall will reduce its performance   a classical trombe wall  also generically called a vented thermal storage wall  has operable vents near the ceiling and floor levels of the mass wall that allow indoor air to flow through them by natural convection  as solar radiation heats the air trapped between the glass and wall and it begins to rise  air is drawn into the lower vent  then into the space between the glass and wall to get heated by solar radiation  increasing its temperature and causing it to rise  and then exit through the top  ceiling  vent back into the indoor space  this allows the wall to directly introduce heated air into the space  usually at a temperature of about 90\xa0\xb0f (32\xa0\xb0c   see figure 16.10   if vents are left open at night  or on cloudy days   a reversal of convective airflow will occur  wasting heat by dissipating it outdoors  vents must be closed at night so radiant heat from the interior surface of the storage wall heats the indoor space  generally  vents are also closed during summer months when heat gain is not needed  during the summer  an exterior exhaust vent installed at the top of the wall can be opened to vent to the outside  such venting makes the system act as a solar chimney driving air through the building during the day   vented thermal storage walls vented to the interior have proven somewhat ineffective  mostly because they deliver too much heat during the day in mild weather and during summer months  they simply overheat and create comfort issues  most solar experts recommended that thermal storage walls should not be vented to the interior   there are many variations of the trombe wall system  an unvented thermal storage wall  technically not a trombe wall  captures solar energy on the exterior surface  heats up  and conducts heat to the interior surface  where it radiates from the interior wall surface to the indoor space later in the day  a water wall uses a type of thermal mass that consists of tanks or tubes of water used as thermal mass   a typical unvented thermal storage wall consists of a south facing masonry or concrete wall with a dark  heat-absorbing material on the exterior surface and faced with a single or double layer of glass  high transmission glass maximizes solar gains to the mass wall  the glass is placed from  xbe to 6 in  (20 to 150\xa0mm  from the wall to create a small airspace  glass framing is typically metal  e g   aluminum  because vinyl will soften and wood will become super dried at the 180\xa0\xb0f (82\xa0\xb0c  temperature that can exist behind the glass in the wall  heat from sunlight passing through the glass is absorbed by the dark surface  stored in the wall  and conducted slowly inward through the masonry  as an architectural detail  patterned glass can limit the exterior visibility of the wall without sacrificing solar transmissivity   a water wall uses containers of water for thermal mass instead of a solid mass wall  water walls are typically slightly more efficient than solid mass walls because they absorb heat more efficiently due to the development of convective currents in the liquid water as it is heated  these currents cause rapid mixing and quicker transfer of heat into the building than can be provided by the solid mass walls   temperature variations between the exterior and interior wall surfaces drive heat through the mass wall  inside the building  however  daytime heat gain is delayed  only becoming available at the interior surface of the thermal mass during the evening when it is needed because the sun has set  the time lag is the time difference between when sunlight first strikes the wall and when the heat enters the building interior  time lag is contingent upon the type of material used in the wall and the wall thickness  a greater thickness yields a greater time lag  the time lag characteristic of thermal mass  combined with dampening of temperature fluctuations  allows the use of varying daytime solar energy as a more uniform night-time heat source  windows can be placed in the wall for natural lighting or aesthetic reasons  but this tends to lower the efficiency somewhat   the thickness of a thermal storage wall should be approximately 10 to 14 in (250 to 350\xa0mm  for brick  12 to 18 in (300 to 450\xa0mm  for concrete  8 to 12 in (200 to 300\xa0mm  for earth adobe  and at least 6 in (150\xa0mm  for water  these thicknesses delay movement of heat such that indoor surface temperatures peak during late evening hours  heat will take about 8 to 10 hours to reach the interior of the building  heat travels through a concrete wall at rate of about one inch per hour   a good thermal connection between the inside wall finishes  e g   drywall  and the thermal mass wall is necessary to maximize heat transfer to the interior space   although the position of a thermal storage wall minimizes daytime overheating of the indoor space  a well-insulated building should be limited to approximately 0.2 to 0.3\xa0ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated (0.2 to 0.3 m2 per m2 of floor area   depending upon climate  a water wall should have about 0.15 to 0.2\xa0ft2 of water wall surface per ft2 (0.15 to 0.2 m2 per m2  of floor area   thermal mass walls are best-suited to sunny winter climates that have high diurnal  day-night  temperature swings  e g   southwest  mountain-west   they do not perform as well in cloudy or extremely cold climates or in climates where there is not a large diurnal temperature swing  nighttime thermal losses through the thermal mass of the wall can still be significant in cloudy and cold climates  the wall loses stored heat in less than a day  and then leak heat  which dramatically raises backup heating requirements  covering the glazing with tight-fitting  moveable insulation panels during lengthy cloudy periods and nighttime hours will enhance performance of a thermal storage system   the main drawback of thermal storage walls is their heat loss to the outside  double glass  glass or any of the plastics  is necessary for reducing heat loss in most climates  in mild climates  single glass is acceptable  a selective surface  high-absorbing low-emitting surface  applied to the exterior surface of the thermal storage wall improves performance by reducing the amount of infrared energy radiated back through the glass  typically  it achieves a similar improvement in performance without the need for daily installation and removal of insulating panels  a selective surface consists of a sheet of metal foil glued to the outside surface of the wall  it absorbs almost all the radiation in the visible portion of the solar spectrum and emits very little in the infrared range  high absorbency turns the light into heat at the wall s surface  and low emittance prevents the heat from radiating back towards the glass  21   roof pond system  a roof pond passive solar system  sometimes called a solar roof  uses water stored on the roof to temper hot and cold internal temperatures  usually in desert environments  it typically is constructed of containers holding 6 to 12 in (150 to 300\xa0mm  of water on a flat roof  water is stored in large plastic bags or fiberglass containers to maximize radiant emissions and minimize evaporation  it can be left unglazed or can be covered by glazing  solar radiation heats the water  which acts as a thermal storage medium  at night or during cloudy weather  the containers can be covered with insulating panels  the indoor space below the roof pond is heated by thermal energy emitted by the roof pond storage above  these systems require good drainage systems  movable insulation  and an enhanced structural system to support a 35 to 70\xa0lb ft2 (1.7 to 3.3\xa0kn m2  dead load   with the angles of incidence of sunlight during the day  roof ponds are only effective for heating at lower and mid-latitudes  in hot to temperate climates  roof pond systems perform better for cooling in hot  low humidity climates  not many solar roofs have been built  and there is limited information on the design  cost  performance  and construction details of thermal storage roofs  21   in an isolated gain passive solar system  the components  e g   collector and thermal storage  are isolated from the indoor area of the building  21   an attached sunspace  also sometimes called a solar room or solarium  is a type of isolated gain solar system with a glazed interior space or room that is part of or attached to a building but which can be completely closed off from the main occupied areas  it functions like an attached greenhouse that makes use of a combination of direct-gain and indirect-gain system characteristics  a sunspace may be called and appear like a greenhouse  but a greenhouse is designed to grow plants whereas a sunspace is designed to provide heat and aesthetics to a building  sunspaces are very popular passive design elements because they expand the living areas of a building and offer a room to grow plants and other vegetation  in moderate and cold climates  however  supplemental space heating is required to keep plants from freezing during extremely cold weather   an attached sunspace u2019s south-facing glass collects solar energy as in a direct-gain system  the simplest sunspace design is to install vertical windows with no overhead glazing  sunspaces may experience high heat gain and high heat loss through their abundance of glazing  although horizontal and sloped glazing collects more heat in the winter  it is minimized to prevent overheating during summer months  although overhead glazing can be aesthetically pleasing  an insulated roof provides better thermal performance  skylights can be used to provide some daylighting potential  vertical glazing can maximize gain in winter  when the angle of the sun is low  and yield less heat gain during the summer  vertical glass is less expensive  easier to install and insulate  and not as prone to leaking  fogging  breaking  and other glass failures  a combination of vertical glazing and some sloped glazing is acceptable if summer shading is provided  a well-designed overhang may be all that is necessary to shade the glazing in the summer   the temperature variations caused by the heat losses and gains can be moderated by thermal mass and low-emissivity windows  thermal mass can include a masonry floor  a masonry wall bordering the house  or water containers  distribution of heat to the building can be accomplished through ceiling and floor level vents  windows  doors  or fans  in a common design  thermal mass wall situated on the back of the sunspace adjacent to the living space will function like an indirect-gain thermal mass wall  solar energy entering the sunspace is retained in the thermal mass  solar heat is conveyed into the building by conduction through the shared mass wall in the rear of the sunspace and by vents  like an unvented thermal storage wall  or through openings in the wall that permit airflow from the sunspace to the indoor space by convection  like a vented thermal storage wall   see figure 16.12  examples of sunspaces are shown in photos 16.33 through 16.35   in cold climates  double glazing should be used to reduce conductive losses through the glass to the outside  night-time heat loss  although significant during winter months  is not as essential in the sunspace as with direct gain systems since the sunspace can be closed off from the rest of the building  in temperate and cold climates  thermally isolating the sunspace from the building at night is important  large glass panels  french doors  or sliding glass doors between the building and attached sunspace will maintain an open feeling without the heat loss associated with an open space   a sunspace with a masonry thermal wall will need approximately 0.3\xa0ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated (0.3 m2 per m2 of floor area   depending on climate  wall thicknesses should be similar to a thermal storage wall  if a water wall is used between the sunspace and living space  about 0.20\xa0ft2 of thermal mass wall surface per ft2 of floor area being heated (0.2 m2 per m2 of floor area  is appropriate  in most climates  a ventilation system is required in summer months to prevent overheating  generally  vast overhead  horizontal  and east- and west-facing glass areas should not be used in a sunspace without special precautions for summer overheating such as using heat-reflecting glass and providing summer-shading systems areas   the internal surfaces of the thermal mass should be dark in color  movable insulation  e g   window coverings  shades  shutters  can be used help trap the warm air in the sunspace both after the sun has set and during cloudy weather  when closed during extremely hot days  window coverings can help keep the sunspace from overheating   to maximize comfort and efficiency  the non-glass sunspace walls  ceiling and foundation should be well insulated  the perimeter of the foundation wall or slab should be insulated to the frost line or around the slab perimeter  in a temperate or cold climate  the east and west walls of the sunspace should be insulated  no glass    measures should be taken to reduce heat loss at night e g  window coverings or movable window insulation   the sun doesn t shine all the time  heat storage  or thermal mass  keeps the building warm when the sun can t heat it   in diurnal solar houses  the storage is designed for one or a few days  the usual method is a custom-constructed thermal mass  this includes a trombe wall  a ventilated concrete floor  a cistern  water wall or roof pond  22  it is also feasible to use the thermal mass of the earth itself  either as-is or by incorporation into the structure by banking or using rammed earth as a structural medium  23   in subarctic areas  or areas that have long terms without solar gain  e g  weeks of freezing fog   purpose-built thermal mass is very expensive  don stephens pioneered an experimental technique to use the ground as thermal mass large enough for annualized heat storage  his designs run an isolated thermosiphon 3\xa0m under a house  and insulate the ground with a 6\xa0m waterproof skirt  24   thermal insulation or superinsulation  type  placement and amount  reduces unwanted leakage of heat  10  some passive buildings are actually constructed of insulation   the effectiveness of direct solar gain systems is significantly enhanced by insulative  e g  double glazing   spectrally selective glazing  low-e   or movable window insulation  window quilts  bifold interior insulation shutters  shades  etc    25   generally  equator-facing windows should not employ glazing coatings that inhibit solar gain   there is extensive use of super-insulated windows in the german passive house standard  selection of different spectrally selective window coating depends on the ratio of heating versus cooling degree days for the design location   the requirement for vertical equator-facing glass is different from the other three sides of a building  reflective window coatings and multiple panes of glass can reduce useful solar gain  however  direct-gain systems are more dependent on double or triple glazing to reduce heat loss  indirect-gain and isolated-gain configurations may still be able to function effectively with only single-pane glazing  nevertheless  the optimal cost-effective solution is both location and system dependent   skylights admit harsh direct overhead sunlight and glare 26  either horizontally  a flat roof  or pitched at the same angle as the roof slope  in some cases  horizontal skylights are used with reflectors to increase the intensity of solar radiation  and harsh glare   depending on the roof angle of incidence  when the winter sun is low on the horizon  most solar radiation reflects off of roof angled glass   the angle of incidence is nearly parallel to roof-angled glass morning and afternoon    when the summer sun is high  it is nearly perpendicular to roof-angled glass  which maximizes solar gain at the wrong time of year  and acts like a solar furnace  skylights should be covered and well-insulated to reduce natural convection   warm air rising   heat loss on cold winter nights  and intense solar heat gain during hot spring summer fall days   the equator-facing side of a building is south in the northern hemisphere  and north in the southern hemisphere  skylights on roofs that face away from the equator provide mostly indirect illumination  except for summer days when the sun may rise on the non-equator side of the building  at some latitudes   skylights on east-facing roofs provide maximum direct light and solar heat gain in the summer morning  west-facing skylights provide afternoon sunlight and heat gain during the hottest part of the day   some skylights have expensive glazing that partially reduces summer solar heat gain  while still allowing some visible light transmission  however  if visible light can pass through it  so can some radiant heat gain  they are both electromagnetic radiation waves    you can partially reduce some of the unwanted roof-angled-glazing summer solar heat gain by installing a skylight in the shade of deciduous  leaf-shedding  trees  or by adding a movable insulated opaque window covering on the inside or outside of the skylight  this would eliminate the daylight benefit in the summer  if tree limbs hang over a roof  they will increase problems with leaves in rain gutters  possibly cause roof-damaging ice dams  shorten roof life  and provide an easier path for pests to enter your attic  leaves and twigs on skylights are unappealing  difficult to clean  and can increase the glazing breakage risk in wind storms    sawtooth roof glazing  with vertical-glass-only can bring some of the passive solar building design benefits into the core of a commercial or industrial building  without the need for any roof-angled glass or skylights   skylights provide daylight  the only view they provide is essentially straight up in most applications  well-insulated light tubes can bring daylight into northern rooms  without using a skylight  a passive-solar greenhouse provides abundant daylight for the equator-side of the building   infrared thermography color thermal imaging cameras   used in formal energy audits   can quickly document the negative thermal impact of roof-angled glass or a skylight on a cold winter night or hot summer day   the u s  department of energy states   vertical glazing is the overall best option for sunspaces   27  roof-angled glass and sidewall glass are not recommended for passive solar sunspaces   the u s  doe explains drawbacks to roof-angled glazing  glass and plastic have little structural strength  when installed vertically  glass  or plastic  bears its own weight because only a small area  the top edge of the glazing  is subject to gravity  as the glass tilts off the vertical axis  however  an increased area  now the sloped cross-section  of the glazing has to bear the force of gravity  glass is also brittle  it does not flex much before breaking  to counteract this  you usually must increase the thickness of the glazing or increase the number of structural supports to hold the glazing  both increase overall cost  and the latter will reduce the amount of solar gain into the sunspace   another common problem with sloped glazing is its increased exposure to the weather  it is difficult to maintain a good seal on roof-angled glass in intense sunlight  hail  sleet  snow  and wind may cause material failure  for occupant safety  regulatory agencies usually require sloped glass to be made of safety glass  laminated  or a combination thereof  which reduce solar gain potential  most of the roof-angled glass on the crowne plaza hotel orlando airport sunspace was destroyed in a single windstorm  roof-angled glass increases construction cost  and can increase insurance premiums  vertical glass is less susceptible to weather damage than roof-angled glass   it is difficult to control solar heat gain in a sunspace with sloped glazing during the summer and even during the middle of a mild and sunny winter day  skylights are the antithesis of zero energy building passive solar cooling in climates with an air conditioning requirement   the amount of solar gain transmitted through glass is also affected by the angle of the incident solar radiation  sunlight striking glass within 20 degrees of perpendicular is mostly transmitted through the glass  whereas sunlight at more than 35 degrees from perpendicular is mostly reflected 28   all of these factors can be modeled more precisely with a photographic light meter and a heliodon or optical bench  which can quantify the ratio of reflectivity to transmissivity  based on angle of incidence   alternatively  passive solar computer software can determine the impact of sun path  and cooling-and-heating degree days on energy performance  regional climatic conditions are often available from local weather services   a design with too much equator-facing glass can result in excessive winter  spring  or fall day heating  uncomfortably bright living spaces at certain times of the year  and excessive heat transfer on winter nights and summer days   although the sun is at the same altitude 6-weeks before and after the solstice  the heating and cooling requirements before and after the solstice are significantly different  heat storage on the earth s surface causes  thermal lag   variable cloud cover influences solar gain potential  this means that latitude-specific fixed window overhangs  while important  are not a complete seasonal solar gain control solution   control mechanisms  such as manual-or-motorized interior insulated drapes  shutters  exterior roll-down shade screens  or retractable awnings  can compensate for differences caused by thermal lag or cloud cover  and help control daily   hourly solar gain requirement variations   home automation systems that monitor temperature  sunlight  time of day  and room occupancy can precisely control motorized window-shading-and-insulation devices   materials and colors can be chosen to reflect or absorb solar thermal energy  using information on a color for electromagnetic radiation to determine its thermal radiation properties of reflection or absorption can assist the choices  nsee lawrence berkeley national laboratory and oak ridge national laboratory   cool colors   energy-efficient landscaping materials for careful passive solar choices include hardscape building material and  softscape  plants  the use of landscape design principles for selection of trees  hedges  and trellis-pergola features with vines  all can be used to create summer shading  for winter solar gain it is desirable to use deciduous plants that drop their leaves in the autumn gives year round passive solar benefits  non-deciduous evergreen shrubs and trees can be windbreaks  at variable heights and distances  to create protection and shelter from winter wind chill  xeriscaping with  mature size appropriate  native species of-and drought tolerant plants  drip irrigation  mulching  and organic gardening practices reduce or eliminate the need for energy-and-water-intensive irrigation  gas powered garden equipment  and reduces the landfill waste footprint  solar powered landscape lighting and fountain pumps  and covered swimming pools and plunge pools with solar water heaters can reduce the impact of such amenities   passive solar lighting techniques enhance taking advantage of natural illumination for interiors  and so reduce reliance on artificial lighting systems   this can be achieved by careful building design  orientation  and placement of window sections to collect light  other creative solutions involve the use of reflecting surfaces to admit daylight into the interior of a building  window sections should be adequately sized  and to avoid over-illumination can be shielded with a brise soleil  awnings  well placed trees  glass coatings  and other passive and active devices  29   another major issue for many window systems is that they can be potentially vulnerable sites of excessive thermal gain or heat loss  whilst high mounted clerestory window and traditional skylights can introduce daylight in poorly oriented sections of a building  unwanted heat transfer may be hard to control  30][31  thus  energy that is saved by reducing artificial lighting is often more than offset by the energy required for operating hvac systems to maintain thermal comfort   various methods can be employed to address this including but not limited to window coverings  insulated glazing and novel materials such as aerogel semi-transparent insulation  optical fiber embedded in walls or roof  or hybrid solar lighting at oak ridge national laboratory   reflecting elements  from active and passive daylighting collectors  such as light shelves  lighter wall and floor colors  mirrored wall sections  interior walls with upper glass panels  and clear or translucent glassed hinged doors and sliding glass doors take the captured light and passively reflect it further inside  the light can be from passive windows or skylights and solar light tubes or from active daylighting sources  in traditional japanese architecture the sh u014dji sliding panel doors  with translucent washi screens  are an original precedent  international style  modernist and mid-century modern architecture were earlier innovators of this passive penetration and reflection in industrial  commercial  and residential applications   there are many ways to use solar thermal energy to heat water for domestic use  different active-and-passive solar hot water technologies have different location-specific economic cost benefit analysis implications   fundamental passive solar hot water heating involves no pumps or anything electrical  it is very cost effective in climates that do not have lengthy sub-freezing  or very-cloudy  weather conditions  32  other active solar water heating technologies  etc  may be more appropriate for some locations   it is possible to have active solar hot water which is also capable of being  off grid  and qualifies as sustainable  this is done by the use of a photovoltaic cell which uses energy from the sun to power the pumps  33   there is growing momentum in europe for the approach espoused by the passive house  passivhaus in german  institute in germany  rather than relying solely on traditional passive solar design techniques  this approach seeks to make use of all passive sources of heat  minimises energy usage  and emphasises the need for high levels of insulation reinforced by meticulous attention to detail in order to address thermal bridging and cold air infiltration  most of the buildings built to the passive house standard also incorporate an active heat recovery ventilation unit with or without a small  typically 1\xa0kw  incorporated heating component   the energy design of passive house buildings is developed using a spreadsheet-based modeling tool called the passive house planning package  phpp  which is updated periodically  the current version is phpp2007  where 2007 is the year of issue  a building may be certified as a  passive house  when it can be shown that it meets certain criteria  the most important being that the annual specific heat demand for the house should not exceed 15kwh m2a   traditionally a heliodon was used to simulate the altitude and azimuth of the sun shining on a model building at any time of any day of the year  34  in modern times  computer programs can model this phenomenon and integrate local climate data  including site impacts such as overshadowing and physical obstructions  to predict the solar gain potential for a particular building design over the course of a year  gps-based smartphone applications can now do this inexpensively on a hand held device  these design tools provide the passive solar designer the ability to evaluate local conditions  design elements and orientation prior to construction  energy performance optimization normally requires an iterative-refinement design-and-evaluate process  there is no such thing as a  one-size-fits-all  universal passive solar building design that would work well in all locations   many detached suburban houses can achieve reductions in heating expense without obvious changes to their appearance  comfort or usability  35  this is done using good siting and window positioning  small amounts of thermal mass  with good-but-conventional insulation  weatherization  and an occasional supplementary heat source  such as a central radiator connected to a  solar  water heater  sunrays may fall on a wall during the daytime and raise the temperature of its thermal mass  this will then radiate heat into the building in the evening  external shading  or a radiant barrier plus air gap  may be used to reduce undesirable summer solar gain   an extension of the  passive solar  approach to seasonal solar capture and storage of heat and cooling  these designs attempt to capture warm-season solar heat  and convey it to a seasonal thermal store for use months later during the cold season   annualised passive solar    increased storage is achieved by employing large amounts of thermal mass or earth coupling  anecdotal reports suggest they can be effective but no formal study has been conducted to demonstrate their superiority  the approach also can move cooling into the warm season  examples   a  purely passive  solar-heated house would have no mechanical furnace unit  relying instead on energy captured from sunshine  only supplemented by  incidental  heat energy given off by lights  computers  and other task-specific appliances  such as those for cooking  entertainment  etc    showering  people and pets  the use of natural convection air currents  rather than mechanical devices such as fans  to circulate air is related  though not strictly solar design  passive solar building design sometimes uses limited electrical and mechanical controls to operate dampers  insulating shutters  shades  awnings  or reflectors  some systems enlist small fans or solar-heated chimneys to improve convective air-flow  a reasonable way to analyse these systems is by measuring their coefficient of performance  a heat pump might use 1 j for every 4 j it delivers giving a cop of 4  a system that only uses a 30 w fan to more-evenly distribute 10\xa0kw of solar heat through an entire house would have a cop of 300   passive solar building design is often a foundational element of a cost-effective zero energy building  36][37  although a zeb uses multiple passive solar building design concepts  a zeb is usually not purely passive  having active mechanical renewable energy generation systems such as  wind turbine  photovoltaics  micro hydro  geothermal  and other emerging alternative energy sources   there has been recent interest in the utilization of the large amounts of surface area on skyscrapers to improve their overall energy efficiency  because skyscrapers are increasingly ubiquitous in urban environments  yet require large amounts of energy to operate  there is potential for large amounts of energy savings employing passive solar design techniques  one study  38  which analyzed the proposed 22 bishopsgate tower in london  found that a 35  energy decrease in demand can theoretically be achieved through indirect solar gains  by rotating the building to achieve optimum ventilation and daylight penetration  usage of high thermal mass flooring material to decrease temperature fluctuation inside the building  and using double or triple glazed low emissivity window glass for direct solar gain  indirect solar gain techniques included moderating wall heat flow by variations of wall thickness  from 20 to 30\xa0cm   using window glazing on the outdoor space to prevent heat loss  dedicating 15-20  of floor area for thermal storage  and implementing a trombe wall to absorb heat entering the space  overhangs are used to block direct sunlight in the summer  and allow it in the winter  and heat reflecting blinds are inserted between the thermal wall and the glazing to limit heat build-up in the summer months   another study 39  analyzed double-green skin facade  dgsf  on the outside of high rise buildings in hong kong  such a green facade  or vegetation covering the outer walls  can combat the usage of air conditioning greatly - as much as 80   as discovered by the researchers   in more temperate climates  strategies such as glazing  adjustment of window-to-wall ratio  sun shading and roof strategies can offer considerable energy savings  in the 30  to 60  range  40
