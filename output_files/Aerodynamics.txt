Aerodynamics
 aerodynamics  from greek \u1f00\u03ae u03c1 aer  air    \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd u03b1\u03bc u03b9\u03ba u03ae  dynamics   the study of the motion of air  particularly it interaction with a solid object  such as an airplane wing  aerodynamics is a sub-field of fluid dynamics and gas dynamics  and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields  the term aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics  the difference being that  gas dynamics  applies to the study of the motion of all gases  and is not limited to air  the formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in the eighteenth century  although observations of fundamental concepts such as aerodynamic drag were recorded much earlier  most of the early efforts in aerodynamics were directed toward achieving heavier-than-air flight  which was first demonstrated by wilbur and orville wright in 1903  since then  the use of aerodynamics through mathematical analysis  empirical approximations  wind tunnel experimentation  and computer simulations has formed a rational basis for the development of heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies  recent work in aerodynamics has focused on issues related to compressible flow  turbulence  and boundary layers and has become increasingly computational in nature       modern aerodynamics only dates back to the seventeenth century  but aerodynamic forces have been harnessed by humans for thousands of years in sailboats and windmills  1  and images and stories of flight appear throughout recorded history  2  such as the ancient greek legend of icarus and daedalus  3  fundamental concepts of continuum  drag  and pressure gradients appear in the work of aristotle and archimedes  4   in 1726  sir isaac newton became the first person to develop a theory of air resistance  5  making him one of the first aerodynamicists  dutch-swiss mathematician daniel bernoulli followed in 1738 with hydrodynamica in which he described a fundamental relationship between pressure  density  and flow velocity for incompressible flow known today as bernoulli s principle  which provides one method for calculating aerodynamic lift  6  in 1757  leonhard euler published the more general euler equations which could be applied to both compressible and incompressible flows  the euler equations were extended to incorporate the effects of viscosity in the first half of the 1800s  resulting in the navier-stokes equations  7][8  the navier-stokes equations are the most general governing equations of fluid flow and but are difficult to solve for the flow around all but the simplest of shapes   in 1799  sir george cayley became the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight  weight  lift  drag  and thrust   as well as the relationships between them  9][10  and in doing so outlined the path toward achieving heavier-than-air flight for the next century  in 1871  francis herbert wenham constructed the first wind tunnel  allowing precise measurements of aerodynamic forces  drag theories were developed by jean le rond d alembert  11  gustav kirchhoff  12  and lord rayleigh  13  in 1889  charles renard  a french aeronautical engineer  became the first person to reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight  14  otto lilienthal  the first person to become highly successful with glider flights  was also the first to propose thin  curved airfoils that would produce high lift and low drag  building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel  the wright brothers flew the first powered airplane on december 17  1903   during the time of the first flights  frederick w  lanchester  15  martin wilhelm kutta  and nikolai zhukovsky independently created theories that connected circulation of a fluid flow to lift  kutta and zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory  expanding upon the work of lanchester  ludwig prandtl is credited with developing the mathematics 16  behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with boundary layers   as aircraft speed increased  designers began to encounter challenges associated with air compressibility at speeds near or greater than the speed of sound  the differences in air flows under such conditions leds to problems in aircraft control  increased drag due to shock waves  and the threat of structural failure due to aeroelastic flutter  the ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the mach number after ernst mach who was one of the first to investigate the properties of supersonic flow  william john macquorn rankine and pierre henri hugoniot independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a shock wave  while jakob ackeret led the initial work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils  17  theodore von k xe1rm xe1n and hugh latimer dryden introduced the term transonic to describe flow speeds around mach 1 where drag increases rapidly  this rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the sound barrier was broken for the first time in 1947 using the bell x-1 aircraft   by the time the sound barrier was broken  aerodynamicists  understanding of the subsonic and low supersonic flow had matured  the cold war prompted the design of an ever-evolving line of high performance aircraft  computational fluid dynamics began as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using computer software  with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions  understanding of supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics has matured since the 1960s  and the goals of aerodynamicists have shifted from the behavior of fluid flow the engineering of a vehicle such that it interacts pedictably with the fluid flow  designing aircraft for supersonic and hypersonic conditions  as well as the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems  continues to motivate new research in aerodynamics  while work continues to be done on important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the navier-stokes equations   understanding the motion of air around an object  often called a flow field  enables the calculation of forces and moments acting on the object  in many aerodynamics problems  the forces of interest are the fundamental forces of flight  lift  drag  thrust  and weight  of these  lift and drag are aerodynamic forces  i e  forces due to air flow over a solid body  calculation of these quantities is often founded upon the assumption that the flow field behaves as a continuum  continuum flow fields are characterized by properties such as flow velocity  pressure  density  and temperature  which may be functions of position and time  these properties may be directly or indirectly measured in aerodynamics experiments or calculated starting with the equations for conservation of mass  momentum  and energy in air flows  density  flow velocity  and an additional property  viscosity  are used to classify flow fields   flow velocity is used to classify flows according to speed regime  subsonic flows are flow fields in which the air speed field is always below the local speed of sound  transonic flows include both regions of subsonic flow and regions in which the local flow speed is greater than the local speed of sound  supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere  a fourth classification  hypersonic flow  refers to flows where the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound  aerodynamicists disagree on the precise definition of hypersonic flow   compressible flow accounts for varying density within the flow  subsonic flows are often idealized as incompressible  i e  the density is assumed to be constant  transonic and supersonic flows are compressible  and calculations that neglect the changes of density in these flow fields will yield inaccurate results   viscosity is associated with the frictional forces in a flow  in some flow fields  viscous effects are very small  and approximate solutions may safely neglect viscous effects  these approximations are called inviscid flows  flows for which viscosity is not neglected are called viscous flows  finally  aerodynamic problems may also be classified by the flow environment  external aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes  e g  around an airplane wing   while internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages inside solid objects  e g  through a jet engine    unlike liquids and solids  gases are composed of discrete molecules which occupy only a small fraction of the volume filled by the gas  on a molecular level  flow fields are made up of many individual collisions between gas molecules and between gas molecules and solid surfaces  however  in most aerodynamics applications  the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored  and the flow field is assumed to behave as a continuum  this assumption allows fluid properties such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere within the flow   the validity of the continuum assumption is dependent on the density of the gas and the application in question  for the continuum assumption to be valid  the mean free path length must be much smaller than the length scale of the application in question  for example  many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions  where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger  in these cases  the length scale of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters  which is much larger than the mean free path length  for such applications  the continuum assumption is reasonable  the continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows  such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes  e g  300,000\xa0ft 90\xa0km  4  or satellites in low earth orbit  in those cases  statistical mechanics is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics  the knudsen number can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics   the assumption of a fluid continuum allows problems in aerodynamics to be solved using fluid dynamics conservation laws  three conservation principles are used   the ideal gas law or another such equation of state is often used in conjunction with these equations to form a determined system that allows the solution for the unknown variables   aerodynamic problems are classified by the flow environment or properties of the flow  including flow speed  compressibility  and viscosity  external aerodynamics is the study of flow around solid objects of various shapes  evaluating the lift and drag on an airplane or the shock waves that form in front of the nose of a rocket are examples of external aerodynamics  internal aerodynamics is the study of flow through passages in solid objects  for instance  internal aerodynamics encompasses the study of the airflow through a jet engine or through an air conditioning pipe   aerodynamic problems can also be classified according to whether the flow speed is below  near or above the speed of sound  a problem is called subsonic if all the speeds in the problem are less than the speed of sound  transonic if speeds both below and above the speed of sound are present  normally when the characteristic speed is approximately the speed of sound   supersonic when the characteristic flow speed is greater than the speed of sound  and hypersonic when the flow speed is much greater than the speed of sound  aerodynamicists disagree over the precise definition of hypersonic flow  a rough definition considers flows with mach numbers above 5 to be hypersonic  4   the influence of viscosity on the flow dictates a third classification  some problems may encounter only very small viscous effects  in which case viscosity can be considered to be negligible  the approximations to these problems are called inviscid flows  flows for which viscosity cannot be neglected are called viscous flows   an incompressible flow is a flow in which density is constant in both time and space  although all real fluids are compressible  a flow is often approximated as incompressible if the effect of the density changes cause only small changes to the calculated results  this is more likely to be true when the flow speeds are significantly lower than the speed of sound  effects of compressibility are more significant at speeds close to or above the speed of sound  the mach number is used to evaluate whether the incompressibility can be assumed  otherwise the effects of compressibility must be included   subsonic  or low-speed  aerodynamics describes fluid motion in flows which are much lower than the speed of sound everywhere in the flow  there are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is inviscid  incompressible and irrotational  this case is called potential flow and allows the differential equations that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of fluid dynamics  thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of quick and easy solutions  18   in solving a subsonic problem  one decision to be made by the aerodynamicist is whether to incorporate the effects of compressibility  compressibility is a description of the amount of change of density in the flow  when the effects of compressibility on the solution are small  the assumption that density is constant may be made  the problem is then an incompressible low-speed aerodynamics problem  when the density is allowed to vary  the flow is called compressible  in air  compressibility effects are usually ignored when the mach number in the flow does not exceed 0.3  about 335 feet (102\xa0m  per second or 228 miles (366\xa0km  per hour at 60\xa0\xb0f (16\xa0\xb0c    above mach 0.3  the problem flow should be described using compressible aerodynamics   according to the theory of aerodynamics  a flow is considered to be compressible if the density changes along a streamline  this means that \u2013 unlike incompressible flow \u2013 changes in density are considered  in general  this is the case where the mach number in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3  the mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary  but it is used because gas flows with a mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5   furthermore  that maximum 5  density change occurs at the stagnation point  the point on the object where flow speed is zero   while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower  transonic  supersonic  and hypersonic flows are all compressible flows   the term transonic refers to a range of flow velocities just below and above the local speed of sound  generally taken as mach 0.8\u20131.2   it is defined as the range of speeds between the critical mach number  when some parts of the airflow over an aircraft become supersonic  and a higher speed  typically near mach 1.2  when all of the airflow is supersonic  between these speeds  some of the airflow is supersonic  while some of the airflow is not supersonic     supersonic aerodynamic problems are those involving flow speeds greater than the speed of sound  calculating the lift on the concorde during cruise can be an example of a supersonic aerodynamic problem   supersonic flow behaves very differently from subsonic flow  fluids react to differences in pressure  pressure changes are how a fluid is  told  to respond to its environment  therefore  since sound is in fact an infinitesimal pressure difference propagating through a fluid  the speed of sound in that fluid can be considered the fastest speed that  information  can travel in the flow  this difference most obviously manifests itself in the case of a fluid striking an object  in front of that object  the fluid builds up a stagnation pressure as impact with the object brings the moving fluid to rest  in fluid traveling at subsonic speed  this pressure disturbance can propagate upstream  changing the flow pattern ahead of the object and giving the impression that the fluid  knows  the object is there by seemingly adjusting its movement and is flowing around it  in a supersonic flow however  the pressure disturbance cannot propagate upstream  thus  when the fluid finally reaches the object it strikes it and the fluid is forced to change its properties \u2013 temperature  density  pressure  and mach number u2014in an extremely violent and irreversible fashion called a shock wave  the presence of shock waves  along with the compressibility effects of high-flow velocity  see reynolds number  fluids  is the central difference between the supersonic and subsonic aerodynamics regimes   in aerodynamics  hypersonic speeds are speeds that are highly supersonic  in the 1970s  the term generally came to refer to speeds of mach 5 (5 times the speed of sound  and above  the hypersonic regime is a subset of the supersonic regime  hypersonic flow is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave  viscous interaction  and chemical dissociation of gas   the incompressible and compressible flow regimes produce many associated phenomena  such as boundary layers and turbulence   the concept of a boundary layer is important in many problems in aerodynamics  the viscosity and fluid friction in the air is approximated as being significant only in this thin layer  this assumption makes the description of such aerodynamics much more tractable mathematically   in aerodynamics  turbulence is characterized by chaotic property changes in the flow  these include low momentum diffusion  high momentum convection  and rapid variation of pressure and flow velocity in space and time  flow that is not turbulent is called laminar flow   aerodynamics is important in a number of applications other than aerospace engineering  it is a significant factor in any type of vehicle design  including automobiles  it is important in the prediction of forces and moments acting on sailing vessels  it is used in the design of mechanical components such as hard drive heads  structural engineers also use aerodynamics  and particularly aeroelasticity  to calculate wind loads in the design of large buildings and bridges  urban aerodynamics seeks to help town planners and designers improve comfort in outdoor spaces  create urban microclimates and reduce the effects of urban pollution  the field of environmental aerodynamics describes the ways atmospheric circulation and flight mechanics affect ecosystems  the aerodynamics of internal passages is important in heating ventilation  gas piping  and in automotive engines where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine  people who do wind turbine design use aerodynamics  a few aerodynamic equations are used as part
