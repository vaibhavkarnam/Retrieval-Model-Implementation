PEMfuelcell
 proton exchange membrane fuel cells  also known as polymer electrolyte membrane  pem  fuel cells  pemfc   are a type of fuel cell being developed for transport applications as well as for stationary fuel cell applications and portable fuel cell applications  their distinguishing features include lower temperature pressure ranges (50 to 100\xa0\xb0c  and a special polymer electrolyte membrane  pemfcs operate on a similar principle to their younger sister technology pem electrolysis  they are a leading candidate to replace the aging alkaline fuel cell technology  which was used in the space shuttle  1       pemfcs are built out of membrane electrode assemblies  mea  which include the electrodes  electrolyte  catalyst  and gas diffusion layers  an ink of catalyst  carbon  and electrode are sprayed or painted onto the solid electrolyte and carbon paper is hot pressed on either side to protect the inside of the cell and also act as electrodes  the pivotal part of the cell is the triple phase boundary  tpb  where the electrolyte  catalyst  and reactants mix and thus where the cell reactions actually occur  2  importantly  the membrane must not be electrically conductive so the half reactions do not mix  operating temperatures above 100\xa0\xb0c are desired citation needed  so the water byproduct becomes steam and water management becomes less critical in cell design   a proton exchange membrane fuel cell transforms the chemical energy liberated during the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to electrical energy  as opposed to the direct combustion of hydrogen and oxygen gases to produce thermal energy   a stream of hydrogen is delivered to the anode side of the mea  at the anode side it is catalytically split into protons and electrons  this oxidation half-cell reaction or hydrogen oxidation reaction  hor  is represented by  nat the anode   the newly formed protons permeate through the polymer electrolyte membrane to the cathode side  the electrons travel along an external load circuit to the cathode side of the mea  thus creating the current output of the fuel cell  meanwhile  a stream of oxygen is delivered to the cathode side of the mea  at the cathode side oxygen molecules react with the protons permeating through the polymer electrolyte membrane and the electrons arriving through the external circuit to form water molecules  this reduction half-cell reaction or oxygen reduction reaction  orr  is represented by   at the cathode     overall reaction   the reversible reaction is expressed in the equation and shows the reincorporation of the hydrogen protons and electrons together with the oxygen molecule and the formation of one water molecule  the potentials in each case are given with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode   to function  the membrane must conduct hydrogen ions  protons  but not electrons as this would in effect  short circuit  the fuel cell  the membrane must also not allow either gas to pass to the other side of the cell  a problem known as gas crossover  4][5  finally  the membrane must be resistant to the reducing environment at the cathode as well as the harsh oxidative environment at the anode   splitting of the hydrogen molecule is relatively easy by using a platinum catalyst  unfortunately however  splitting the oxygen molecule is more difficult  and this causes significant electric losses  an appropriate catalyst material for this process has not been discovered  and platinum is the best option   a cheaper alternative to platinum is cerium iv  oxide catalyst used by the research group of professor vladim xedr matol xedn in the development of pemfc  6][7][8   the pemfc is a prime candidate for vehicle and other mobile applications of all sizes down to mobile phones  because of its compactness  however  the water management is crucial to performance  too much water will flood the membrane  too little will dry it  in both cases  power output will drop  water management is a very difficult subject in pem systems  primarily because water in the membrane is attracted toward the cathode of the cell through polarization  a wide variety of solutions for managing the water exist including integration of electroosmotic pumps  furthermore  the platinum catalyst on the membrane is easily poisoned by carbon monoxide  no more than one part per million is usually acceptable  and the membrane is sensitive to things like metal ions  which can be introduced by corrosion of metallic bipolar plates  metallic components in the fuel cell system or from contaminants in the fuel oxidant   pem systems that use reformed methanol were proposed  as in daimler chrysler necar 5  reforming methanol  i e  making it react to obtain hydrogen  is however a very complicated process  that requires also purification from the carbon monoxide the reaction produces  a platinum-ruthenium catalyst is necessary as some carbon monoxide will unavoidably reach the membrane  the level should not exceed 10 parts per million  furthermore  the start-up times of such a reformer reactor are of about half an hour  alternatively  methanol  and some other biofuels can be fed to a pem fuel cell directly without being reformed  thus making a direct methanol fuel cell  dmfc   these devices operate with limited success   the most commonly used membrane is nafion by chemours  which relies on liquid water humidification of the membrane to transport protons  this implies that it is not feasible to use temperatures above 80 to 90\xa0\xb0c  since the membrane would dry  other  more recent membrane types  based on polybenzimidazole  pbi  or phosphoric acid  can reach up to 220\xa0\xb0c without using any water management  higher temperature allow for better efficiencies  power densities  ease of cooling  because of larger allowable temperature differences   reduced sensitivity to carbon monoxide poisoning and better controllability  because of absence of water management issues in the membrane   however  these recent types are not as common  9  pbi can be doped with phosphoric or sulfuric acid and the conductivity scales with amount of doping and temperature  10  at high temperatures  it is difficult to keep nafion hydrated  but this acid doped material does not use water as a medium for proton conduction  it also exhibits better mechanical properties  higher strength  than nafion and is cheaper  however  acid leaching is a considerable issue and processing  mixing with catalyst to form ink  has proved tricky  aromatic polymers  such as peek  are far cheaper than teflon  ptfe and backbone of nafion  and their polar character leads to hydration that is less temperature dependent than nafion  however  peek is far less ionically conductive than nafion and thus is a less favorable electrolyte choice  11  recently  protic ionic liquids and protic organic ionic plastic crystals have been shown as promising alternative electrolyte materials for high temperature (100\u2013200\xa0\xb0c  pemfcs  12  [13  [14   in order to enable the electrochemical reactions at the electrodes  protons  electrons and the reactant gases  hydrogen or oxygen  must gain access to the surface of the catalyst in the electrodes  while the product water  which can be in either liquid or gaseous phase  or both phases  must be able to permeate from the catalyst to the gas outlet  these properties are typically realized by porous composites of polymer electrolyte binder  ionomer  and catalyst nanoparticles supported on carbon particles  15  typically platinum is used as the catalyst for the electrochemical reactions at the anode and cathode  while nanoparticles realize high surface to weight ratios  as further described below  reducing the amount of the costly platinum  the polymer electrolyte binder provides the ionic conductivity  while the carbon support of the catalyst improves the electric conductivity and enables low platinum metal loading  16  the electric conductivity in the composite electrodes is typically more than 40 times higher as the proton conductivity  17   the gdl electrically connects the catalyst and current collector  it must be porous  electrically conductive  and thin  the reactants must be able to reach the catalyst  but conductivity and porosity can act as opposing forces  optimally  the gdl should be composed of about one third nafion or 15  ptfe  the carbon particles used in the gdl can be larger than those employed in the catalyst because surface area is not the most important variable in this layer  gdl should be around 15-35\xa0\xb5m thick to balance needed porosity with mechanical strength  18  often  an intermediate porous layer is added between the gdl and catalyst layer to ease the transitions between the large pores in the gdl and small porosity in the catalyst layer  since a primary function of the gdl is to help remove water  a product  flooding can occur when water effectively blocks the gdl  this limits the reactants ability to access the catalyst and significantly decreases performance  teflon can be coated onto the gdl to limit the possibility of flooding  11  several microscopic variables are analyzed in the gdls such as  porosity  tortuosity and permeability  these variables have incidence over the behavior of the fuel cells  19  two major gdl substrates  carbon cloth and paper  were compared  indicative of different cell performances  20   the maximal theoretical efficiency applying the gibbs free energy equation \u0394g -237.13 kj mol and using the

create losses are   metal-organic frameworks  mofs  are a relatively new class of porous  highly crystalline materials that consist of metal nodes connected by organic linkers  due to the simplicity of manipulating or substituting the metal centers and ligands  there are a virtually limitless number of possible combinations  which is attractive from a design standpoint  mofs exhibit many unique properties due to their tunable pore sizes  thermal stability  high volume capacities  large surface areas  and desirable electrochemical characteristics  among their many diverse uses  mofs are promising candidates for clean energy applications such as hydrogen storage  gas separations  supercapacitors  li-ion batteries  solar cells  and fuel cells  within the field of fuel cell research  mofs are being studied as potential electrolyte materials and electrode catalysts that could someday replace traditional polymer membranes and pt catalysts  respectively   as electrolyte materials  the inclusion of mofs seems at first counter-intuitive  fuel cell membranes generally have low porosity to prevent fuel crossover and loss of voltage between the anode and cathode  additionally  membranes tend to have low crystallinity because the transport of ions is more favorable in disordered materials  on the other hand  pores can be filled with additional ion carriers that ultimately enhance the ionic conductivity of the system and high crystallinity makes the design process less complex   the general requirements of a good electrolyte for pemfcs are  high proton conductivity (&gt 10\u22122 s cm for practical applications  to enable proton transport between electrodes  good chemical and thermal stability under fuel cell operating conditions  environmental humidity  variable temperatures  resistance to poisonous species  etc    low cost  ability to be processed into thin-films  and overall compatibility with other cell components  21  while polymeric materials are currently the preferred choice of proton-conducting membrane  they require humidification for adequate performance and can sometimes physically degrade due to hydrations effects  thereby causing losses of efficiency  as mentioned  nafion is also limited by a dehydration temperature of  lt  100\xa0\xb0c  which can lead to slower reaction kinetics  poor cost efficiency  and co poisoning of pt electrode catalysts  conversely  mofs have shown encouraging proton conductivities in both low and high temperature regimes as well as over a wide range of humidity conditions  below 100\xa0\xb0c and under hydration  the presence of hydrogen bonding and solvent water molecules aid in proton transport  whereas anhydrous conditions are suitable for temperatures above 100\xa0\xb0c  mofs also have the distinct advantage of exhibiting proton conductivity by the framework itself in addition to the inclusion of charge carries  i e   water  acids  etc   into their pores   a low temperature example is work by kitagawa  et al  who used a two-dimensional oxalate-bridged anionic layer framework as the host and introduced ammonium cations and adipic acid molecules into the pores to increase proton concentration  22  the result was one of the first instances of a mof showing \u201csuperprotonic u201d conductivity (8 x 10\u22123 s cm  at 25\xa0\xb0c and 98  relative humidity  rh   they later found that increasing the hydrophilic nature of the cations introduced into the pores could enhance proton conductivity even more  in this low temperature regime that is dependent on degree of hydration  it has also been shown that proton conductivity is heavily dependent on humidity levels   a high temperature anhydrous example is pcmof2  which consists of sodium ions coordinated to a trisulfonated benzene derivative  23  to improve performance and allow for higher operating temperatures  water can be replaced as the proton carrier by less volatile imidazole or triazole molecules within the pores  the maximum temperature achieved was 150\xa0\xb0c with an optimum conductivity of 5 x 10\u22124 s cm  which is lower than other current electrolyte membranes  however  this model holds promise for its temperature regime  anhydrous conditions  and ability to control the quantity of guest molecules within the pores  all of which allowed for the tunability of proton conductivity  additionally  the triazole-loaded pcmof2 was incorporated into a h2 air membrane-electrode assembly and achieved an open circuit voltage of 1.18 v at 100\xa0\xb0c that was stable for 72 hours and managed to remain gas tight throughout testing  this was the first instance that proved mofs could actually be implemented into functioning fuel cells  and the moderate potential difference showed that fuel crossover due to porosity was not an issue   to date  the highest proton conductivity achieved for a mof electrolyte is 4.2 x 10\u22122 s cm at 25\xa0\xb0c under humid conditions (98  rh   which is competitive with nafion  21  some recent experiments have even successfully produced thin-film mof membranes instead of the traditional bulk samples or single crystals  which is crucial for their industrial applicability  once mofs are able to consistently achieve sufficient conductivity levels  mechanical strength  water stability  and simple processing  they have the potential to play an important role in pemfcs in the near future   mofs have also been targeted as potential replacements of platinum group metal  pgm  materials for electrode catalysts  although this research is still in the early stages of development  in pemfcs  the oxygen reduction reaction  orr  at the pt cathode is significantly slower than the fuel oxidation reaction at the anode  and thus non-pgm and metal-free catalysts are being investigated as alternatives  the high volumetric density  large pore surface areas  and openness of metal-ion sites in mofs make them ideal candidates for catalyst precursors  24  despite promising catalytic abilities  the durability of these proposed mof-based catalysts is currently less than desirable and the orr mechanism in this context is still not completely understood   much of the current research on catalysts for pem fuel cells can be classified as having one of following main objectives   examples of these approaches are given in the following sections   as mentioned above  platinum is by far the most effective element used for pem fuel cell catalysts  and nearly all current pem fuel cells use platinum particles on porous carbon supports to catalyze both hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction  however  due to their high cost  current pt c catalysts are not feasible for commercialization  the u s  department of energy estimates that platinum-based catalysts will need to use roughly four times less platinum than is used in current pem fuel cell designs in order to represent a realistic alternative to internal combustion engines  25  consequently  one main goal of catalyst design for pem fuel cells is to increase the catalytic activity of platinum by a factor of four so that only one-fourth as much of the precious metal is necessary to achieve similar performance   one method of increasing the performance of platinum catalysts is to optimize the size and shape of the platinum particles  decreasing the particles u2019 size alone increases the total surface area of catalyst available to participate in reactions per volume of platinum used  but recent studies have demonstrated additional ways to make further improvements to catalytic performance  for example  one study reports that high-index facets of platinum nanoparticles  that is miller indexes with large integers  such as pt (730   provide a greater density of reactive sites for oxygen reduction than typical platinum nanoparticles  26   since the most common and effective catalyst  platinum  is extremely expensive  alternative processing is necessary to maximize surface area and minimize loading  deposition of nanosized pt particles onto carbon powder  pt c  provides a large pt surface area while the carbon allows for electrical connection between the catalyst and the rest of the cell  platinum is so effective because it has high activity and bonds to the hydrogen just strongly enough to facilitate electron transfer but not inhibit the hydrogen from continuing to move around the cell  however  platinum is less active in the cathode oxygen reduction reaction  this necessitates the use of more platinum  increasing the cell u2019s expense and thus feasibility  many potential catalyst choices are ruled out because of the extreme acidity of the cell  11   the most effective ways of achieving the nanoscale pt on carbon powder  which is currently the best option  are through vacuum deposition  sputtering  and electrodeposition  the platinum particles are deposited onto carbon paper that is permeated with ptfe  however  there is an optimal thinness to this catalyst layer  which limits the lower cost limit  below 4\xa0nm  pt will form islands on the paper  limiting its activity  above this thickness  the pt will coat the carbon and be an effective catalyst  to further complicate things  nafion cannot be infiltrated beyond 10\xa0um  so using more pt than this is an unnecessary expense  thus the amount and shape of the catalyst is limited by the constraints of other materials  18   a second method of increasing the catalytic activity of platinum is to alloy it with other metals  for example  it was recently shown that the pt3ni 111  surface has a higher oxygen reduction activity than pure pt 111  by a factor of ten  27  the authors attribute this dramatic performance increase to modifications to the electronic structure of the surface  reducing its tendency to bond to oxygen-containing ionic species present in pem fuel cells and hence increasing the number of available sites for oxygen adsorption and reduction   further efficiencies can be realized using an ultrasonic nozzle to apply the platinum catalyst to the electrolyte layer or to carbon paper under atmospheric conditions resulting in high efficiency spray  28  studies have shown that due to the uniform size of the droplets created by this type of spray  due to the high transfer efficiency of the technology  due to the non-clogging nature of the nozzle and finally due to the fact that the ultrasonic energy de-agglomerates the suspension just before atomization  fuel cells mea s manufactured this way have a greater homogeneity in the final mea  and the gas flow through the cell is more uniform  maximizing the efficiency of the platinum in the mea  29  recent studies using inkjet printing to deposit the catalyst over the membrane have also shown high catalyst utilization due to the reduced thickness of the deposited catalyst layers  30  [31   very recently  a new class of orr electrocatalysts have been introduced in the case of pt-m (m-fe 32  and co  systems with an ordered intermetallic core encapsulated within a pt-rich shell  33  these intermetallic core-shell  imcs  nanocatalysts were found to exhibit an enhanced activity and most importantly  an extended durability compared to many previous designs  while the observed enhancement in the activities is ascribed to a strained lattice  the authors report that their findings on the degradation kinetics establish that the extended catalytic durability is attributable to a sustained atomic order   another practical approach is through multi-layer configuration catalyst layer   34][35  this idea was promoted by the highly spatial variation of reaction rate through the catalyst layer  which is measured by a new dimensionless parameter  h  36   the other popular approach to improving catalyst performance is to reduce its sensitivity to impurities in the fuel source  especially carbon monoxide  co   presently  pure hydrogen gas is becoming economical to mass-produce by electrolysis  however  at the moment hydrogen gas is produced by steam reforming light hydrocarbons  a process which produces a mixture of gases that also contains co (1\u20133    co2 (19\u201325    and n2 (25%).[37  even tens of parts per million of co can poison a pure platinum catalyst  so increasing platinum u2019s resistance to co is an active area of research   for example  one study reported that cube-shaped platinum nanoparticles with (100  facets displayed a fourfold increase in oxygen reduction activity compared to randomly faceted platinum nanoparticles of similar size  38  the authors concluded that the (111  facets of the randomly shaped nanoparticles bonded more strongly to sulfate ions than the (100  facets  reducing the number of catalytic sites open to oxygen molecules  the nanocubes they synthesized  in contrast  had almost exclusively (100  facets  which are known to interact with sulfate more weakly  as a result  a greater fraction of the surface area of those particles was available for the reduction of oxygen  boosting the catalyst u2019s oxygen reduction activity   in addition  researchers have been investigating ways of reducing the co content of hydrogen fuel before it enters a fuel cell as a possible way to avoid poisoning the catalysts  one recent study revealed that ruthenium-platinum core u2013shell nanoparticles are particularly effective at oxidizing co to form co2  a much less harmful fuel contaminant  39  the mechanism that produces this effect is conceptually similar to that described for pt3ni above  the ruthenium core of the particle alters the electronic structure of the platinum surface  rendering it better able to catalyze the oxidation of co   the challenge for the viability of pem fuel cells today still remains in their cost and stability  the high cost can in large part be attributed to the use of the precious metal of platinum in the catalyst layer of pem cells  the electrocatalyst currently accounts for nearly half of the fuel cell stack cost  40  although the pt loading of pem fuel cells has been reduced by two orders of magnitude over the past decade  41  further reduction is necessary to make the technology economically viable for commercialization  whereas some research efforts aim to address this issue by improving the electrocatalytic activity of pt-based catalysts  an alternative is to eliminate the use of pt altogether by developing a non-platinum-group-metal  non-pgm  cathode catalyst whose performance rivals that of pt-based technologies  the u s  department of energy has been setting milestones for the development of fuel cells  targeting a durability of 5000 hours and a non-pgm catalyst orr volumetric activity of 300 a cm u22123 [42   promising alternatives to pt-based catalysts are metal nitrogen  carbon-catalysts  m n c-catalysts   to achieve high power density  or output of power over surface area of the cell  a volumetric activity of at least 1/10 that of pt-based catalysts must be met  40  along with good mass transport properties  while m n c-catalysts still demonstrate poorer volumetric activities than pt-based catalysts  the reduced costs of such catalysts allows for greater loading to compensate  however  increasing the loading of m n c-catalysts also renders the catalytic layer thicker  impairing its mass transport properties  in other words  h2  o2  protons  and electrons have greater difficulty in migrating through the catalytic layer  decreasing the voltage output of the cell  while high microporosity of the m n c catalytic network results in high volumetric activity  improved mass transport properties are instead associated to macroporosity of the network  these m n c materials are synthesized using high temperature pyrolysis and other high temperature treatments of precursors containing the metal  nitrogen  and carbon  43   recently  researchers have developed a fe n c catalyst derived from iron  ii  acetate  feac   phenanthroline  phen   and a metal-organic-framework  mof  host  the mof is a zn ii  zeolitic imidazolate framework  zif  called zif-8  which demonstrates a high microporous surface area and high nitrogen content conducive to orr activity  40  the power density of the feac phen zif-8-catalyst was found to be 0.75 w cm u22122 at 0.6 v  this value is a significant improvement over the maximal 0.37 w cm u22122 power density of previous m n c-catalysts and is much closer to matching the typical value of 1-1.2 w cm u22122 for pt-based catalysts with a pt loading of 0.3\xa0mg cm u22122  the catalyst also demonstrated a volumetric activity of 230 a cm u22123  the highest value for non-pgm catalysts to date  40  approaching the u s  department of energy milestone   while the power density achieved by the novel feac phen zif-8-catalyst is promising  its durability remains inadequate for commercial application  it is reported that the best durability exhibited by this catalyst still had a 15  drop in current density over 100 hours in h2/air  40  hence while the fe-based non-pgm catalysts rival pt-based catalysts in their electrocatalytic activity  there is still much work to be done in improving their durability          the major application of pem fuel cells focuses on transportation primarily because of their potential impact on the environment  e g  the control of emission of the green house gases  ghg   other applications include distributed stationary and portable power generation  most major motor companies work solely on pem fuel cells due to their high power density and excellent dynamic characteristics as compared with other types of fuel cells  44  due to their light weight  pemfcs are most suited for transportation applications  pemfcs for buses  which use compressed hydrogen for fuel  can operate at up to 40  efficiency  generally pemfcs are implemented on buses over smaller cars because of the available volume to house the system and store the fuel  technical issues for transportation involve incorporation of pems into current vehicle technology and updating energy systems  full fuel cell vehicles are not advantageous if hydrogen is sourced from fossil fuels  however  they become beneficial when implemented as hybrids  there is potential for pemfcs to be used for stationary power generation  where they provide 5\xa0kw at 30  efficiency  however  they run into competition with other types of fuel cells  mainly sofcs and mcfcs  whereas pemfcs generally require high purity hydrogen for operation  other fuel cell types can run on methane and are thus more flexible systems  therefore  pemfcs are best for small scale systems until economically scalable pure hydrogen is available  furthermore  pemfcs have the possibility of replacing batteries for portable electronics  though integration of the hydrogen supply is a technical challenge particularly without a convenient location to store it within the device  45   before the invention of pem fuel cells  existing fuel cell types such as solid-oxide fuel cells were only applied in extreme conditions  such fuel cells also required very expensive materials and could only be used for stationary applications due to their size  these issues were addressed by the pem fuel cell  the pem fuel cell was invented in the early 1960s by willard thomas grubb and leonard niedrach of general electric  46  initially  sulfonated polystyrene membranes were used for electrolytes  but they were replaced in 1966 by nafion ionomer  which proved to be superior in performance and durability to sulfonated polystyrene   pem fuel cells were used in the nasa gemini series of spacecraft  but they were replaced by alkaline fuel cells in the apollo program and in the space shuttle   parallel with pratt and whitney aircraft  general electric developed the first proton exchange membrane fuel cells  pemfcs  for the gemini space missions in the early 1960s  the first mission to use pemfcs was gemini v  however  the apollo space missions and subsequent apollo-soyuz  skylab and space shuttle missions used fuel cells based on bacon s design  developed by pratt and whitney aircraft   extremely expensive materials were used and the fuel cells required very pure hydrogen and oxygen  early fuel cells tended to require inconveniently high operating temperatures that were a problem in many applications  however  fuel cells were seen to be desirable due to the large amounts of fuel available  hydrogen and oxygen   citation needed   despite their success in space programs  fuel cell systems were limited to space missions and other special applications  where high cost could be tolerated  it was not until the late 1980s and early 1990s that fuel cells became a real option for wider application base  several pivotal innovations  such as low platinum catalyst loading and thin film electrodes  drove the cost of fuel cells down  making development of pemfc systems more realistic  47  however  there is significant debate as to whether hydrogen fuel cells will be a realistic technology for use in automobiles or other vehicles   see hydrogen economy
