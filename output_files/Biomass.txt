Biomass
 biomass is an industry term for getting energy by burning wood  and other organic matter  burning biomass releases carbon emissions  around a quarter higher than burning coal  but has been classed as a  renewable  energy source in the eu and un legal frameworks  because plants can be regrown  1  it has become popular among coal power stations  which switch from coal to biomass to comply with the law  biomass most often refers to plants or plant-based materials that are not used for food or feed  and are specifically called lignocellulosic biomass  2  as an energy source  biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat  or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuel  conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into  thermal  chemical  and biochemical methods       historically  humans have harnessed biomass-derived energy since the time when people began burning wood to make fire  3  even today  biomass is the only source of fuel for domestic use in many developing countries  biomass is all biologically-produced matter based in carbon  hydrogen and oxygen  the estimated biomass production in the world is 104.9 petagrams (104.9 \xd7 1015 g \u2013 about 105 billion metric tons  of carbon per year  about half in the ocean and half on land  4   wood remains the largest biomass energy source today  3  examples include forest residues  such as dead trees  branches and tree stumps   yard clippings  wood chips and even municipal solid waste  wood energy is derived by using lignocellulosic biomass  second-generation biofuels  as fuel  harvested wood may be used directly as a fuel or collected from wood waste streams to be processed into pellet fuel or other forms of fuels  the largest source of energy from wood is pulping liquor or  black liquor   a waste product from processes of the pulp  paper and paperboard industry  citation needed  in the second sense  biomass includes plant or animal matter that can be converted into fibers or other industrial chemicals  including biofuels  industrial biomass can be grown from numerous types of plants  including miscanthus  5  switchgrass  hemp  corn  poplar  willow  sorghum  sugarcane  bamboo  6  and a variety of tree species  ranging from eucalyptus to oil palm  palm oil    based on the source of biomass  biofuels are classified broadly into two major categories  first-generation biofuels are derived from sources such as sugarcane and corn starch  sugars present in this biomass are fermented to produce bioethanol  an alcohol fuel which can be used directly in a fuel cell to produce electricity or serve as an additive to gasoline  however  utilizing food-based resources for fuel production only aggravates the food shortage problem  7  second-generation biofuels  on the other hand  utilize non-food-based biomass sources such as agriculture and municipal waste  these biofuels mostly consist of lignocellulosic biomass  which is not edible and is a low-value waste for many industries  despite being the favored alternative  economical production of second-generation biofuel is not yet achieved due to technological issues  these issues arise mainly due to chemical inertness and structural rigidity of lignocellulosic biomass  8][9][10   plant energy is produced by crops specifically grown for use as fuel that offer high biomass output per hectare with low input energy  some examples of these plants are wheat  which typically yields 7.5\u20138 tonnes of grain per hectare  and straw  which typically yields 3.5\u20135 tonnes per hectare in the uk  11  the grain can be used for liquid transportation fuels while the straw can be burned to produce heat or electricity  plant biomass can also be degraded from cellulose to glucose through a series of chemical treatments  and the resulting sugar can then be used as a first-generation biofuel   the main contributors of waste energy are municipal solid waste  manufacturing waste  and landfill gas  energy derived from biomass is projected to be the largest non-hydroelectric renewable resource of electricity in the us between 2000 and 2020.[12   biomass can be converted to other usable forms of energy like methane gas or transportation fuels like ethanol and biodiesel  rotting garbage  and agricultural and human waste  all release methane gas  also called landfill gas or biogas  crops such as corn and sugarcane can be fermented to produce the transportation fuel ethanol  biodiesel  another transportation fuel  can be produced from leftover food products like vegetable oils and animal fats  13  several biodiesel companies simply collect used restaurant cooking oil and convert it into biodiesel  14  also  biomass-to-liquids  called  btls   and cellulosic ethanol are still under research  15][16   there is research involving algae or algae-derived biomass  as this non-food resource can be produced at rates five to ten times those of other types of land-based agriculture  such as corn and soy  once harvested  it can be fermented to produce biofuels such as ethanol  butanol  and methane  as well as biodiesel and hydrogen  efforts are being made to identify which species of algae are most suitable for energy production  genetic engineering approaches could also be utilized to improve microalgae as a source of biofuel  17   the biomass used for electricity generation varies by region  forest by-products  such as wood residues  are common in the us  agricultural waste is common in mauritius  sugar cane residue  and southeast asia  rice husks   animal husbandry residues  such as poultry litter  are common in the uk  18   sewage sludge can be another source of biomass  for example  the omni processor is a process which uses sewage sludge as fuel in a process of sewage sludge treatment  with surplus electrical energy being generated for export  19][20   if the total annual primary production of biomass is just over 100 billion (1.0e 11  tonnes of carbon /yr  21  and the energy reserve per tonne of biomass is between about 1.5\xd7103 and 3\xd7103 kilowatt hours (5\xd7106 and 10\xd7106 btu   22  or 24.8\xa0tw average  then biomass could in principle provide 1.4 times the approximate annual 150\xd7103 terawatt-hours required for current world energy consumption  23  for reference  the total solar power on earth is 174\xa0pw  the biomass equivalent to solar energy ratio is 143\xa0ppm  parts per million   given current living system coverage on earth  the best currently attainable solar cell efficiency is 20\u201340   additionally  earth s internal radioactive energy production  largely the driver for volcanic activity  continental drift  etc   is in the same range of power  20\xa0tw  at around 50  carbon mass content in biomass  annual production  this corresponds to about 6  atmospheric carbon content in the form of co2  for the current 400\xa0ppm    thermal conversion processes use heat as the dominant mechanism to convert biomass into another chemical form  also known as thermal oil heating  it is a type of indirect heating in which a liquid phase heat transfer medium is heated and circulated to one or more heat energy users within a closed loop system  31  the basic alternatives of combustion  torrefaction  pyrolysis  and gasification  are separated principally by the extent to which the chemical reactions involved are allowed to proceed  mainly controlled by the availability of oxygen and conversion temperature    energy created by burning biomass is particularly suited for countries where the fuel wood grows more rapidly  e g  tropical countries  there are a number of other less common  more experimental or proprietary thermal processes that may offer benefits such as hydrothermal upgrading  htu  and hydroprocessing  some have been developed for use on high moisture content biomass  including aqueous slurries  and allow them to be converted into more convenient forms  some of the applications of thermal conversion are combined heat and power  chp  and co-firing  in a typical dedicated biomass power plant  efficiencies range from 20\u201327   higher heating value basis   32  biomass cofiring with coal  by contrast  typically occurs at efficiencies near those of the coal combustor (30\u201340   higher heating value basis   33   a range of chemical processes may be used to convert biomass into other forms  such as to produce a fuel that is more conveniently used  transported or stored  or to exploit some property of the process itself  many of these processes are based in large part on similar coal-based processes  such as fischer-tropsch synthesis  methanol production  olefins  ethylene and propylene   and similar chemical or fuel feedstocks  in most cases  the first step involves gasification  which step generally is the most expensive and involves the greatest technical risk  34  biomass is more difficult to feed into a pressure vessel than coal or any liquid  therefore  biomass gasification is frequently done at atmospheric pressure and causes combustion of biomass to produce a combustible gas consisting of carbon monoxide  hydrogen  and traces of methane  this gas mixture  called a producer gas  can provide fuel for various vital processes  such as internal combustion engines  as well as substitute for furnace oil in direct heat applications  35  because any biomass material can undergo gasification  this process is far more attractive than ethanol or biomass production  where only particular biomass materials can be used to produce a fuel  in addition  biomass gasification is a desirable process due to the ease at which it can convert solid waste  such as wastes available on a farm  into producer gas  which is a very usable fuel  35   conversion of biomass to biofuel can also be achieved via selective conversion of individual components of biomass  36  for example  cellulose can be converted to intermediate platform chemical such a sorbitol  37  glucose  38  hydroxymethylfurfural 39  etc  these chemical are then further reacted to produce hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuels  40   biomass also has the potential to be converted to multiple commodity chemicals  halomethanes have successfully been by produced using a combination of a  fermentans and engineered s  cerevisiae  41  this method converts nax salts and unprocessed biomass such as switchgrass  sugarcane  corn stover  or poplar into halomethanes  s-adenosylmethionine which is naturally occurring in s  cerevisiae allows a methyl group to be transferred  production levels of 150\xa0mg l-1h-1 iodomethane were achieved  at these levels roughly 173000l of capacity would need to be operated just to replace the united states u2019 need for iodomethane  41  however  an advantage of this method is that it uses nai rather than i2  nai is significantly less hazardous than i2  this method may be applied to produce ethylene in the future   other chemical processes such as converting straight and waste vegetable oils into biodiesel is transesterification  42   as biomass is a natural material  many highly efficient biochemical processes have developed in nature to break down the molecules of which biomass is composed  and many of these biochemical conversion processes can be harnessed   biochemical conversion makes use of the enzymes of bacteria and other microorganisms to break down biomass into gaseous or liquid fuels  such a biogas or bioethanol  43  in most cases  microorganisms are used to perform the conversion process  anaerobic digestion  fermentation  and composting   in addition to combustion  biomass biofuels can be directly converted to electrical energy via electrochemical  electrocatalytic  oxidation of the material  this can be performed directly in a direct carbon fuel cell  44  direct liquid fuel cells such as direct ethanol fuel cell  a direct methanol fuel cell  a direct formic acid fuel cell  a l-ascorbic acid fuel cell  vitamin c fuel cell   45  and a microbial fuel cell  46  the fuel can also be consumed indirectly via a fuel cell system containing a reformer which converts the biomass into a mixture of co and h2 before it is consumed in the fuel cell  47   the biomass power generating industry in the united states consists of approximately 11,000 mw of summer operating capacity actively supplying power to the grid  and produces about 1.4 percent of the u s  electricity supply  48   public service of new hampshire  later merged with other companies into eversource  in 2006 replaced a 50 mw coal boiler with a new 50 mw biomass boiler at its schiller station facility in portsmouth  nh  49  the boiler s biomass fuel is from sources in nh  massachusetts and maine   currently  the new hope power partnership is the largest biomass power plant in the u s  the 140 mw facility uses sugarcane fiber  bagasse  and recycled urban wood as fuel to generate enough power for its large milling and refining operations as well as to supply electricity for nearly 60,000 homes  50][51   second-generation biofuels were not  in 2010  produced commercially  but a considerable number of research activities were taking place mainly in north america  europe and also in some emerging countries  these tend to use feedstock produced by rapidly reproducing enzymes or bacteria from various sources including excrement 52  grown in cell cultures or hydroponics  53][54  there is huge potential for second generation biofuels but non-edible feedstock resources are highly under-utilized  55   using biomass as a fuel produces air pollution in the form of carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide  nox  nitrogen oxides   vocs  volatile organic compounds   particulates and other pollutants at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas in some cases  such as with indoor heating and cooking   56][57][58  utilization of wood biomass as a fuel can also produce fewer particulate and other pollutants than open burning as seen in wildfires or direct heat applications  59  black carbon \u2013 a pollutant created by combustion of fossil fuels  biofuels  and biomass \u2013 is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming  60]:56\u201357 in 2009 a swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in south asia determined that it had been principally produced by open burning of biomass  and to a lesser extent by fossil-fuel burning  61  researchers measured a significant concentration of 14c (carbon-14   which is associated with recent plant life rather than with fossil fuels  62   biomass power plant size is often driven by biomass availability in close proximity as transport costs of the  bulky  fuel play a key factor in the plant s economics  it has to be noted  however  that rail and especially shipping on waterways can reduce transport costs significantly  which has led to a global biomass market  63  to make small plants of 1 mwel economically profitable those power plants need to be equipped with technology that is able to convert biomass to useful electricity with high efficiency such as orc technology  a cycle similar to the water steam power process just with an organic working medium  such small power plants can be found in europe  64][65][66][67   on combustion  the carbon from biomass is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (co2   the amount of carbon stored in dry wood is approximately 50  by weight  68  however  according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations  plant matter used as a fuel can be replaced by planting for new growth  when the biomass is from forests  the time to recapture the carbon stored is generally longer  and the carbon storage capacity of the forest may be reduced overall if destructive forestry techniques are employed  69][70][71][72   industry professionals claim that a range of issues can affect a plant s ability to comply with emissions standards  some of these challenges  unique to biomass plants  include inconsistent fuel supplies and age  the type and amount of the fuel supply are completely reliant factors  the fuel can be in the form of building debris or agricultural waste  such as removal of invasive species or orchard trimmings   furthermore  many of the biomass plants are old  use outdated technology and were not built to comply with today u2019s stringent standards  in fact  many are based on technologies developed during the term of u s  president jimmy carter  who created the united states department of energy in 1977.[3   the u s  energy information administration projected that by 2017  biomass is expected to be about twice as expensive as natural gas  slightly more expensive than nuclear power  and much less expensive than solar panels  73  in another eia study released  concerning the government u2019s plan to implement a 25  renewable energy standard by 2025  the agency assumed that 598 million tons of biomass would be available  accounting for 12  of the renewable energy in the plan  74   the adoption of biomass-based energy plants has been a slow but steady process  between the years of 2002 and 2012 the production of these plants has increased 14%.[75  in the united states  alternative electricity-production sources on the whole generate about 13  of power  of this fraction  biomass contributes approximately 11  of the alternative production  76  according to a study conducted in early 2012  of the 107 operating biomass plants in the united states  85 have been cited by federal or state regulators for the violation of clean air or water standards laws over the past 5 years  this data also includes minor infractions  75   despite harvesting  biomass crops may sequester carbon  for example  soil organic carbon has been observed to be greater in switchgrass stands than in cultivated cropland soil  especially at depths below 12\xa0inches  77  the grass sequesters the carbon in its increased root biomass  typically  perennial crops sequester much more carbon than annual crops due to much greater non-harvested living biomass  both living and dead  built up over years  and much less soil disruption in cultivation   the proposal that biomass is carbon-neutral put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature  intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas  when a tree s carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse  it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades  current studies indicate that  even after 50 years the forest has not recovered to its initial carbon storage  and  the optimal strategy is likely to be protection of the standing forest   78  not in citation given  79][80   the pros and cons of biomass usage regarding carbon emissions may be quantified with the iluc factor  there is controversy surrounding the usage of the iluc factor  81   forest-based biomass has recently come under fire from a number of environmental organizations  including greenpeace and the natural resources defense council  for the harmful impacts it can have on forests and the climate  greenpeace recently released a report entitled  fuelling a biomess  82  which outlines their concerns around forest-based biomass  because any part of the tree can be burned  the harvesting of trees for energy production encourages whole-tree harvesting  which removes more nutrients and soil cover than regular harvesting  and can be harmful to the long-term health of the forest  in some jurisdictions  forest biomass removal is increasingly involving elements essential to functioning forest ecosystems  including standing trees  naturally disturbed forests and remains of traditional logging operations that were previously left in the forest  environmental groups also cite recent scientific research which has found that it can take many decades for the carbon released by burning biomass to be recaptured by regrowing trees  and even longer in low productivity areas  furthermore  logging operations may disturb forest soils and cause them to release stored carbon  citation needed  in light of the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the short term in order to mitigate the effects of climate change  a number of environmental groups are opposing the large-scale use of forest biomass in energy production  82][83   with the seasonality of biomass supply and a great variability in sources  supply chains play a key role in cost-effective delivery of bioenergy  there are several potential challenges unique to bioenergy supply chains  84   technical issues  logistic issues  financial issues  social issues  policy and regulatory issues  institutional and organizational issues
