 hungary is a member of the european union and thus takes part in the eu strategy to increase its share of renewable energy  the eu has adopted the 2009 renewable energy directive  which included a 20  renewable energy target by 2020 for the eu  1  by 2030 wind should produce in average 26-35  of the eu s electricity and save europe \u20ac56 billion a year in avoided fuel costs  2  the national authors of hungary forecast is 14.7  renewables in gross energy consumption by 2020  exceeding their 13  binding target by 1.7 percentage points  hungary is the eu country with the smallest forecast penetration of renewables of the electricity demand in 2020  namely only 11   including biomass 6  and wind power 3     in 2015  10,5  of the gross hungarian electricity production came from renewables  52  of that amount was from biomass  22  was from wind  7  was from hydroenergy and 3  was from solar  3       the national forecast included 400 mw of new wind power capacity between 2010-2020  ewea u2019s 2009 forecast expected hungary to reach 1.2 gw of installed wind capacity in this time  1  in the end of 2010 wind power capacity was 295 mw  4  however  since 2010  no further wind energy tenders were accepted  in 2016  the hungarian government banned the installation of new wind energy capacities with administrative measures  5  the current capacity of wind power in hungary is 329 mw   the hungarian solar power generation is rapidly advancing  although from a small basis by the end of 2015 hungary had installed more than 110 megawatt  mw  of photovoltaics  the country s capacity is expected to double in 2016.[10   located in the carpathian basin  hungary has limited access to hydroelectricity  since the unfortunate case of the gab u010d xedkovo u2013nagymaros dams project  the building of hydroelectric dams is extremely unpopular in the hungarian society  the existing croatian plans of building new dams on the shared sections of the river drava are rejected by the hungarian government  11  hungary s two largest hydroelectric dams (tiszal xf6k  kisk xf6re  are built on the river tisza  with 12,5 mw and 28 mw capacities  respectively  the remaining power stations are usually former mills transformed to small hydroelectric dams   geothermal energy is widely used in hungary for the heating of homes and industrial areas  the first power plant using geothermal energy is being built in tura with the capacity of 2,6 mw  its operation is expected to start in 2017.[12
