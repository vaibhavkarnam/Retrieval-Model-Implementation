RenewableenergyinBangladesh
 renewable energy in bangladesh refers to the use of renewable energy to generate electricity in bangladesh  the current renewable energy comes from biogas  hydro power  solar and wind  1][2       the long term average sunshine data indicates that the period of bright sunshine hours in the coastal regions of bangladesh varies from 3 to 11 hours daily  3  the insolation in bangladesh varies from 3.8 kwh m2 day to 6.4 kwh m2 day at an average of 5 kwh m2 day  these indicate that there are good prospects for solar thermal and photovoltaic application in the country  4   with an estimated 40  of the population in bangladesh having no access to electricity  the government introduced a scheme known as solar home systems  shs  to provide electricity to households with no grid access  5  the program reached 3 million households as of late 2014 and  with more than 50,000 systems being added per month since 2009  the world bank has called it  the fastest growing solar home system program in the world   6   the bangladeshi government is working towards universal electricity access by 2021 with the shs program projected to cover 6 million households by 2017.[7   the long term wind flow  especially in the islands and the southern coastal belt of bangladesh indicate that the average wind speed remains between 3 and 4.5\xa0m s for the months of march to september and 1.7 to 2.3 for remaining period of the year  8  there is a good opportunity in island and coastal areas for the application of wind mills for pumping and electrification  but during the summer and monsoon seasons  march to october  there can be very low pressure areas and storm wind speeds 200 to 300\xa0kmph can be expected  wind turbines have to be strong enough to withstand these high wind speeds  9   the tides at chittagong division are predominantly semidiurnal with a large variation in range corresponding to the seasons  the maximum occurring during the south-west monsoon  in 1984  an attempt was made by mechanical engineering department of kuet to assess the feasibility of tidal energy in the coastal regions of bangladesh  especially at cox s bazar and at the islands of maheshkhali and kutubdia  the average tidal range was found within 4-5 meter and the amplitude of the spring tide exceeds even 6 meter  10  from different calculations  it is anticipated that there are a number of suitable sites at cox s bazar  maheshkhali  kutubdia and other places where permanent basins with pumping arrangements might be constructed which would be a double operation scheme  11][12   bangladesh has favorable conditions for wave energy especially during the period beginning from late march to early october  waves generated in bay of bengal and a result of the southwestern wind is significant  13  maximum wave height of over 2 meter with an absolute maximum of 2.4 meter were recorded  the wave periods varied from 3 to 4 seconds for waves of about 0.5 meter and about 6 seconds for waves of about 2 meter  3   in order to save the large cities from environment pollution  the waste management as well as electricity generation from the solid wastes programme is being taken by the government  14][15   there mainly two types of biogas plants used in bangladesh  floating dome type and fixed dome type  bag type plants are also used in the country but rarely  16][17][18    media related to renewable energy in bangladesh at wikimedia commons
