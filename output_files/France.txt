 it is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in paris  the country s largest city and main cultural and commercial centre  other major urban centres include marseille xvi   lyon  lille  nice  toulouse and bordeaux   during the iron age  what is now metropolitan france was inhabited by the gauls  a celtic people  the area was annexed in 51 bc by rome  which held gaul until 486  when the germanic franks conquered the region and formed the kingdom of france  france emerged as a major european power in the late middle ages  with its victory in the hundred years  war (1337 to 1453  strengthening state-building and political centralisation  during the renaissance  french culture flourished and a global colonial empire was established  which by the 20th century would be the second largest in the world  9  the 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between catholics and protestants  huguenots   france became europe s dominant cultural  political  and military power under louis xiv  10  in the late 18th century  the french revolution overthrew the absolute monarchy  established one of modern history s earliest republics  and saw the drafting of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen  which expresses the nation s ideals to this day   in the 19th century napoleon took power and established the first french empire  whose subsequent napoleonic wars shaped the course of continental europe  following the collapse of the empire  france endured a tumultuous succession of governments culminating with the establishment of the french third republic in 1870  france was a major participant in the first world war  from which it emerged victorious  and was one of the allied powers in the second world war  but came under occupation by the axis powers in 1940  following liberation in 1944  a fourth republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the algerian war  the fifth republic  led by charles de gaulle  was formed in 1958 and remains to this day  algeria and nearly all the other colonies became independent in the 1960s with minimal controversy and typically retained close economic and military connections with france   france has long been a global centre of art  science  and philosophy  it hosts europe s fourth-largest number of cultural unesco world heritage sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually  the most of any country in the world  11  france is a developed country with the world s sixth-largest economy by nominal gdp 12  and ninth-largest by purchasing power parity  13  in terms of aggregate household wealth  it ranks fourth in the world  14  france performs well in international rankings of education  health care  life expectancy  and human development  15][16  france remains a great power in the world  17  being one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council with the power to veto and an official nuclear-weapon state  it s a leading member state of the european union and the eurozone  18  it is also a member of the group of 7  north atlantic treaty organization  nato   organisation for economic co-operation and development  oecd   the world trade organization  wto   and la francophonie       originally applied to the whole frankish empire  the name  france  comes from the latin francia  or  country of the franks   19  modern france is still named today francia in italian and spanish  frankreich in german and frankrijk in dutch  all of which have the same historical meaning   there are various theories as to the origin of the name frank  following the precedents of edward gibbon and jacob grimm  20  the name of the franks has been linked with the word frank  free  in english  21  it has been suggested that the meaning of  free  was adopted because  after the conquest of gaul  only franks were free of taxation  22  another theory is that it is derived from the proto-germanic word frankon  which translates as javelin or lance as the throwing axe of the franks was known as a francisca  23  however  it has been determined that these weapons were named because of their use by the franks  not the other way around  24   the oldest traces of human life in what is now france date from approximately 1.8 million years ago  25  humans were then confronted by a harsh and variable climate  marked by several glacial eras  early homonids led a nomadic hunter-gatherer life  25  france has a large number of decorated caves from the upper palaeolithic era  including one of the most famous and best preserved  lascaux 25   approximately 18,000 bc    at the end of the last glacial period (10,000 bc   the climate became milder  25  from approximately 7,000 bc  this part of western europe entered the neolithic era and its inhabitants became sedentary  after strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia  metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium  initially working gold  copper and bronze  and later iron  26  france has numerous megalithic sites from the neolithic period  including the exceptionally dense carnac stones site  approximately 3,300 bc    in 600 bc  ionian greeks  originating from phocaea  founded the colony of massalia  present-day marseille   on the shores of the mediterranean sea  this makes it france s oldest city  27][28  at the same time  some gallic celtic tribes penetrated parts of the current territory of france  and this occupation spread to the rest of france between the 5th and 3rd century bc  29   the concept of gaul emerged at that time  it corresponds to the territories of celtic settlement ranging between the rhine  the atlantic ocean  the pyrenees and the mediterranean  the borders of modern france are roughly the same as those of ancient gaul  which was inhabited by celtic gauls  gaul was then a prosperous country  of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to greek and roman cultural and economic influences   around 390 bc the gallic chieftain brennus and his troops made their way to italy through the alps  defeated the romans in the battle of the allia  and besieged and ransomed rome  the gallic invasion left rome weakened  and the gauls continued to harass the region until 345 bc when they entered into a formal peace treaty with rome  but the romans and the gauls would remain adversaries for the next several centuries  and the gauls would continue to be a threat in italia   around 125 bc  the south of gaul was conquered by the romans  who called this region provincia nostra   our province    which over time evolved into the name provence in french  30  julius caesar conquered the remainder of gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the gallic chieftain vercingetorix in 52 bc  31  gaul was divided by augustus into roman provinces  32  many cities were founded during the gallo-roman period  including lugdunum  present-day lyon   which is considered the capital of the gauls  32  these cities were built in traditional roman style  with a forum  a theatre  a circus  an amphitheatre and thermal baths  the gauls mixed with roman settlers and eventually adopted roman culture and roman speech  latin  from which the french language evolved   the roman polytheism merged with the gallic paganism into the same syncretism   from the 250s to the 280s ad  roman gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians  33  nevertheless  the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century  which was a period of revival and prosperity for roman gaul  34  in 312  the emperor constantin i converted to christianity  subsequently  christians  who had been persecuted until then  increased rapidly across the entire roman empire  35  but  from the beginning of the 5th century  the barbarian invasions resumed  36  and germanic tribes  such as the vandals  suebi and alans crossed the rhine and settled in gaul  spain and other parts of the collapsing roman empire  37   at the end of the antiquity period  ancient gaul was divided into several germanic kingdoms and a remaining gallo-roman territory  known as the kingdom of syagrius  simultaneously  celtic britons  fleeing the anglo-saxon settlement of britain  settled the western part of armorica  as a result  the armorican peninsula was renamed brittany  celtic culture was revived and independent petty kingdoms arose in this region   the pagan franks  from whom the ancient name of  francie  was derived  originally settled the north part of gaul  but under clovis i conquered most of the other kingdoms in northern and central gaul  in 498  clovis i was the first germanic conqueror after the fall of the roman empire to convert to catholic christianity  rather than arianism  thus france was given the title  eldest daughter of the church   french  la fille a xeen xe9e de l  xc9glise  by the papacy  38  and french kings would be called  the most christian kings of france   rex christianissimus    the franks embraced the christian gallo-roman culture and ancient gaul was eventually renamed francia   land of the franks    the germanic franks adopted romanic languages  except in northern gaul where roman settlements were less dense and where germanic languages emerged  clovis made paris his capital and established the merovingian dynasty  but his kingdom would not survive his death  the franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs  so four kingdoms emerged from clovis s  paris  orl xe9ans  soissons  and rheims  the last merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace  head of household   one mayor of the palace  charles martel  defeated an islamic invasion of gaul at the battle of tours (732  and earned respect and power within the frankish kingdoms  his son  pepin the short  seized the crown of francia from the weakened merovingians and founded the carolingian dynasty  pepin s son  charlemagne  reunited the frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across western and central europe   proclaimed holy roman emperor by pope leo iii and thus establishing in earnest the french government s longtime historical association with the catholic church  39  charlemagne tried to revive the western roman empire and its cultural grandeur  charlemagne s son  louis i  emperor 814\u2013840   kept the empire united  however  this carolingian empire would not survive his death  in 843  under the treaty of verdun  the empire was divided between louis  three sons  with east francia going to louis the german  middle francia to lothair i  and west francia to charles the bald  west francia approximated the area occupied by  and was the precursor  to modern france  40   during the 9th and 10th centuries  continually threatened by viking invasions  france became a very decentralised state  the nobility s titles and lands became hereditary  and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen  thus was established feudalism in france  over time  some of the king s vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king  for example  after the battle of hastings in 1066  william the conqueror added  king of england  to his titles  becoming both the vassal to  as duke of normandy  and the equal of  as king of england  the king of france  creating recurring tensions   the carolingian dynasty ruled france until 987  when hugh capet  duke of france and count of paris  was crowned king of the franks  41  his descendants u2014the capetians  the house of valois  and the house of bourbon u2014progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance into the kingdom of france  which was fully declared in 1190 by philip ii augustus  the french nobility played a prominent role in most crusades in order to restore christian access to the holy land  french knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the two-hundred-year span of the crusades  in such a fashion that the arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as franj caring little whether they really came from france  42  the french crusaders also imported the french language into the levant  making french the base of the lingua franca  litt   frankish language   of the crusader states  42  french knights also comprised the majority in both the hospital and the temple orders  the latter  in particular  held numerous properties throughout france and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the french crown  until philip iv annihilated the order in 1307  the albigensian crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day france  in the end  the cathars were exterminated and the autonomous county of toulouse was annexed into the kingdom of france  43  later kings expanded their domain to cover over half of modern continental france  including most of the north  centre and west of france  meanwhile  the royal authority became more and more assertive  centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility  clergy  and commoners   charles iv the fair died without an heir in 1328.[44  under the rules of the salic law the crown of france could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line  44  accordingly  the crown passed to philip of valois  a cousin of charles  rather than through the female line to charles  nephew  edward  who would soon become edward iii of england  during the reign of philip of valois  the french monarchy reached the height of its medieval power  44  philip s seat on the throne was contested by edward iii of england and in 1337  on the eve of the first wave of the black death  45  england and france went to war in what would become known as the hundred years  war  46  the exact boundaries changed greatly with time  but french landholdings of the english kings remained extensive for decades  with charismatic leaders  such as joan of arc and la hire  strong french counterattacks won back english continental territories  like the rest of europe  france was struck by the black death  half of the 17 million population of france died  47][48   the french renaissance saw a spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the french language  which would become the official language of france and the language of europe s aristocracy  it also saw a long set of wars  known as the italian wars  between the kingdom of france and the powerful holy roman empire  french explorers  such as jacques cartier or samuel de champlain  claimed lands in the americas for france  paving the way for the expansion of the first french colonial empire  the rise of protestantism in europe led france to a civil war known as the french wars of religion  where  in the most notorious incident  thousands of huguenots were murdered in the st  bartholomew s day massacre of 1572.[49  the wars of religion were ended by henry iv s edict of nantes  which granted some freedom of religion to the huguenots   under louis xiii  the energetic cardinal richelieu reinforced the centralisation of the state  royal power and french dominance in europe  foreshadowing the reign of louis xiv  during louis xiv s minority and the regency of queen anne and cardinal mazarin  a period of trouble known as the fronde occurred in france  which was at that time at war with spain  this rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal power in france   the monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of louis xiv  by turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the palace of versailles  louis xiv s personal power became unchallenged  remembered for his numerous wars  he made france the leading european power  france became the most populous country in europe and had tremendous influence over european politics  economy  and culture  french became the most-used language in diplomacy  science  literature and international affairs  and remained so until the 20th century  50  france obtained many overseas possessions in the americas  africa and asia  louis xiv also revoked the edict of nantes  forcing thousands of huguenots into exile   under louis xv  louis xiv s grandson  france lost new france and most of its indian possessions after its defeat in the seven years  war  which ended in 1763  its european territory kept growing  however  with notable acquisitions such as lorraine (1766  and corsica (1770   an unpopular king  louis xv s weak rule  his ill-advised financial  political and military decisions \u2013 as well as the debauchery of his court u2013 discredited the monarchy  which arguably paved the way for the french revolution 15 years after his death  51][52   louis xvi  louis xv s grandson  actively supported the americans  who were seeking their independence from great britain  realised in the treaty of paris (1783    the financial crisis that followed france s involvement in the american revolutionary war was one of many contributing factors to the french revolution  much of the enlightenment occurred in french intellectual circles  and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions  such as the discovery of oxygen (1778  and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers (1783   were achieved by french scientists  french explorers  such as bougainville and lap xe9rouse  took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe  the enlightenment philosophy  in which reason is advocated as the primary source for legitimacy and authority  undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and helped pave the way for the french revolution   facing financial troubles  louis xvi summoned the estates-general  gathering the three estates of the realm  in may 1789 to propose solutions to his government  as it came to an impasse  the representatives of the third estate formed into a national assembly  signalling the outbreak of the french revolution  fearing that the king would suppress the newly created national assembly  insurgents stormed the bastille on 14 july 1789  a date which would become france s national day   the absolute monarchy was subsequently replaced by a constitutional monarchy  through the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen  france established fundamental rights for men  the declaration affirms  the natural and imprescriptible rights of man  to  liberty  property  security and resistance to oppression   freedom of speech and press were declared  and arbitrary arrests outlawed  it called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men  as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth  while louis xvi  as a constitutional king  enjoyed popularity among the population  his disastrous flight to varennes seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion  his credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility   european monarchies gathered against the new r xe9gime  to restore the french absolute monarchy  the foreign threat exacerbated france s political turmoil and deepened the sense of urgency among the various factions and war was declared against austria on 20 april 1792  mob violence occurred during the insurrection of 10 august 1792[53  and the following month  54  as a result of this violence and the political instability of the constitutional monarchy  the republic was proclaimed on 22 september 1792   louis xvi was convicted of treason and guillotined in 1793  facing increasing pressure from european monarchies  internal guerrilla wars and counterrevolutions  such as the war in the vend xe9e   the young republic fell into the reign of terror  between 1793 and 1794  between 16,000 and 40,000 people were executed  in western france  the civil war between the bleus   blues   supporters of the revolution  and the blancs   whites   supporters of the monarchy  lasted from 1793 to 1796 and led to the loss of between 200,000 and 450,000 lives  55][56  both foreign armies and french counter-revolutionaries were crushed and the french republic survived  furthermore  it extended greatly its boundaries and established  sister republics  in the surrounding countries  as the threat of a foreign invasion receded and france became mostly pacified  the thermidorian reaction put an end to robespierre s rule and to the terror  the abolition of slavery and male universal suffrage  enacted during this radical phase of the revolution  were cancelled by subsequent governments   after a short-lived governmental scheme  napoleon bonaparte seized control of the republic in 1799 becoming first consul and later emperor of the french empire (1804\u20131814/1815   as a continuation of the wars sparked by the european monarchies against the french republic  changing sets of european coalitions declared wars on napoleon s empire  his armies conquered most of continental europe with swift victories such as the battles of jena-auerstadt or austerlitz  he redrew the european political map  while members of the bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms  57  these victories led to the worldwide expansion of french revolutionary ideals and reforms  such as the metric system  the napoleonic code and the declaration of the rights of man  after the catastrophic russian campaign  and the ensuing uprising of european monarchies against his rule  napoleon was defeated and the bourbon monarchy restored  about a million frenchmen died during the napoleonic wars  57   after his brief return from exile  napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the battle of waterloo  the monarchy was re-established (1815\u20131830   with new constitutional limitations  the discredited bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the july revolution of 1830  which established the constitutional july monarchy  which lasted until 1848  when the french second republic was proclaimed  in the wake of the european revolutions of 1848  the abolition of slavery and male universal suffrage  both briefly enacted during the french revolution were re-enacted in 1848  in 1852  the president of the french republic  louis-napol xe9on bonaparte  napoleon i s nephew  was proclaimed emperor of the second empire  as napoleon iii  he multiplied french interventions abroad  especially in crimea  in mexico and italy which resulted in the annexation of the duchy of savoy and the county of nice  then part of the kingdom of sardinia  napoleon iii was unseated following defeat in the franco-prussian war of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the third republic  france had colonial possessions  in various forms  since the beginning of the 17th century  but in the 19th and 20th centuries  its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the second largest in the world behind the british empire  including metropolitan france  the total area of land under french sovereignty almost reached 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s  8.6  of the world s land  known as the belle \xc9poque  the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism  regional peace  economic prosperity and technological  scientific and cultural innovations  in 1905  state secularism was officially established   france was a member of the triple entente when world war i broke out  a small part of northern france was occupied  but france and its allies emerged victorious against the central powers at a tremendous human and material cost  world war i left 1.4\xa0million french soldiers dead  4  of its population  58  between 27 and 30  of soldiers conscripted from 1912\u20131915 were killed  59  the interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the popular front government  annual leave  eight-hour workdays  women in government  etc       in 1940 france was invaded and occupied by nazi germany  metropolitan france was divided into a german occupation zone in the north and vichy france  a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with germany  in the south  while free france  the government-in-exile led by charles de gaulle  was set up in london  60  from 1942 to 1944  about 160,000 french citizens  including around 75,000 jews  61][62][63  were deported to death camps and concentration camps in germany and poland  64  on 6 june 1944 the allies invaded normandy and in august they invaded provence  over the following year the allies and the french resistance emerged victorious over the axis powers and french sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the provisional government of the french republic  gprf   this interim government  established by de gaulle  aimed to continue to wage war against germany and to purge collaborators from office  it also made several important reforms  suffrage extended to women  creation of a social security system    the gprf laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the fourth republic  which saw spectacular economic growth  les trente glorieuses   france was one of the founding members of nato (1949   france attempted to regain control of french indochina but was defeated by the viet minh in 1954 at the climactic battle of dien bien phu  only months later  france faced another anti-colonialist conflict in algeria  torture and illegal executions were perpetrated by both sides and the debate over whether or not to keep control of algeria  then home to over one million european settlers  65  wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war  66   in 1958  the weak and unstable fourth republic gave way to the fifth republic  which included a strengthened presidency  67  in the latter role  charles de gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the war  the algerian war was concluded with the \xc9vian accords in 1962 that led to algerian independence  a vestige of the colonial empire are the french overseas departments and territories   in the context of the cold war  de gaulle pursued a policy of  national independence  towards the western and eastern blocs  to this end  he withdrew from nato s military integrated command  he launched a nuclear development programme and made france the fourth nuclear power  he restored cordial franco-german relations in order to create a european counterweight between the american and soviet spheres of influence  however  he opposed any development of a supranational europe  favouring a europe of sovereign nations  in the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968  the revolt of may 1968 had an enormous social impact  in france  it is considered to be the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal  religion  patriotism  respect for authority  shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal  secularism  individualism  sexual revolution   although the revolt was a political failure  as the gaullist party emerged even stronger than before  it announced a split between the french people and de gaulle who resigned shortly after   in the post-gaullist era  france remained one of the most developed economies in the world  but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt  in the late 20th and early 21st centuries france has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational european union  notably by signing the maastricht treaty  which created the european union  in 1992  establishing the eurozone in 1999  and signing the lisbon treaty in 2007.[68  france has also gradually but fully reintegrated into nato and has since participated in most nato sponsored wars  69   since the 19th century france has received many immigrants  these have been mostly male foreign workers from european catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed  70  during the 1970s france faced economic crisis and allowed new immigrants  mostly from the maghreb 70   to permanently settle in france with their families and to acquire french citizenship  it resulted in hundreds of thousands of muslims  especially in the larger cities  living in subsidised public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates  71  simultaneously france renounced the assimilation of immigrants  where they were expected to adhere to french traditional values and cultural norms  they were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integrate  72   since the 1995 paris m xe9tro and rer bombings  france has been sporadically targeted by islamist organisations  notably the charlie hebdo attack in january 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in french history  gathering 4.4 million people  73][74  the november 2015 paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths  the deadliest attack on french soil since world war ii  75][76  and the deadliest in the european union since the madrid train bombings in 2004[77  and the 2016 nice attack which caused 87

the most industrialised countries in the world  france is ranked only 17th by carbon dioxide emissions  behind less populous nations such as canada or australia  this is because france decided to invest in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis  81  which now accounts for 75  of its electricity production 82  and results in less pollution  83][84   like all european union members  france

armorican massif  the massif central  the morvan massif  the vosges and ardennes ranges and the island of corsica were formed  these massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the aquitaine

in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law   basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the napoleonic code  which was  in turn  largely based on the royal law codified under louis xiv   in agreement with the principles of the declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen  law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society  as guy canivet  first president of the court of cassation  wrote about the management of prisons  freedom is the rule  and its restriction is the exception  any restriction of freedom must be provided for by law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality  that is  law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed  and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy   french law is divided into two principal areas  private law and public law  private law includes  in particular  civil law and criminal law  public law includes  in particular  administrative law and constitutional law  however  in practical terms  french law comprises three principal areas of law  civil law  criminal law  and administrative law  criminal laws can only address the future and not the past  criminal ex post facto laws are prohibited   115  while administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries  it is completely separated in france and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court  ordinary courts  which handle criminal and civil litigation  are headed by the court of cassation and administrative courts are headed by the council of state   to be applicable  every law must be officially published in the journal officiel de la r xe9publique fran xe7aise   france does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions  france has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws  the latter being abolished in 1791   however   offences against public decency

since its creation  granting subsidies to artists  promoting french culture in the world  supporting festivals and cultural events  protecting historical monuments  the french government also succeeded in maintaining a cultural exception to defend audiovisual products made in the country   france receives the highest number of tourists per year  largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory  it counts 1,200 museums welcoming more than 50\xa0million people annually  292  the most important cultural sites are run by

 the most famous medieval french painter  is said to have been the first to travel to italy and experience the early renaissance at first hand  the renaissance painting school of fontainebleau was directly inspired by italian painters such as primaticcio and rosso fiorentino  who both worked in france  two of the most famous french artists of the time of baroque era  nicolas poussin and claude lorrain  lived in italy   the 17th century was the period when french painting became prominent and individualised itself through classicism  louis xiv s prime minister jean-baptiste colbert founded in 1648 the royal academy of painting and sculpture to protect these artists  and in 1666 he created the still-active french academy in rome to have direct relations with italian artists   french artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century  as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style  the works of the court-endorsed artists antoine watteau  fran xe7ois boucher and jean-honor xe9 fragonard being the most representative in the country  the french revolution brought great changes  as napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as jacques-louis david and the highly influential acad xe9mie des beaux-arts defined the style known as academism  at this time france had become a centre of artistic creation  the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements  at first romanticism with th xe9odore g xe9ricault and eug xe8ne delacroix  and realism with camille corot  gustave courbet and jean-fran xe7ois millet  a style that eventually evolved into naturalism   in the second part of the 19th century  france s influence over painting became even more important  with the development of new styles of painting such as impressionism and symbolism  the most famous impressionist painters of the period were camille pissarro  \xc9douard manet  edgar degas  claude monet and auguste renoir  294  the second generation of impressionist-style painters  paul c xe9zanne  paul gauguin  toulouse-lautrec and georges seurat  were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions  295  as well as the fauvist artists henri matisse  andr xe9 derain and maurice de vlaminck  296][297   at the beginning of the 20th century  cubism was developed by georges braque and the spanish painter pablo picasso  living in paris  other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near paris  such as vincent van gogh  marc chagall  amedeo modigliani and wassily kandinsky   many museums in france are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works  a huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned mus xe9e du louvre  such as mona lisa  also known as la joconde  while the louvre palace has been for a long time a museum  the mus xe9e d orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station gare d orsay  in a major reorganisation of national art collections  to gather

contemporary works  300   outside paris  all the large cities have a museum of fine arts with a section dedicated to european and french painting  some of the finest collections are in lyon  lille  rouen  dijon  rennes and grenoble   during the middle ages  many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers  some french castles that survived are chinon  ch xe2teau d angers  the massive ch xe2teau de vincennes and the so-called cathar castles  during this era  france had been using romanesque architecture like most of western europe  some of the greatest examples of romanesque churches in france are the saint sernin basilica in toulouse  the largest romanesque church in europe  301  and the remains of the cluniac abbey   the gothic architecture  originally named opus francigenum meaning  french work   302  was born in  xcele-de-france and was the first french style of architecture to be copied in all europe  303  northern france is the home of some of the most important gothic cathedrals and basilicas  the first of these being the saint denis basilica  used as the royal necropolis   other important french gothic cathedrals are notre-dame de chartres and notre-dame d amiens  the kings were crowned in another important gothic church  notre-dame de reims  304  aside from churches  gothic architecture had been used for many religious palaces  the most important one being the palais des papes in avignon   the final victory in the hundred years  war marked an important stage in the evolution of french architecture  it was the time of the french renaissance and several artists from italy were invited to the french court  many residential palaces were built in the loire valley  such residential castles were the ch xe2teau de chambord  the ch xe2teau de chenonceau  or the ch xe2teau d amboise   following the renaissance and the end of the middle ages  baroque architecture replaced the traditional gothic style  however  in france  baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one  305  in the secular domain  the palace of versailles has many baroque features  jules hardouin mansart  who designed the extensions to versailles  was one of the most influential french architect of the baroque era  he is famous for his dome at les invalides  306  some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet french such as the place stanislas in nancy  on the military architectural side  vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in europe and became an influential military architect  as a result  imitations of his works can be found all over europe  the americas  russia and turkey  307][308   after the revolution  the republicans favoured neoclassicism although neoclassicism was introduced in france prior to the revolution with such building as the parisian pantheon or the capitole de toulouse  built during the first french empire  the arc de triomphe and sainte marie-madeleine represent the best example of empire style architecture  310   under napoleon iii  a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth  extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque palais garnier were built  the urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous  for example  haussmann s renovation of paris  the architecture associated to this era is named second empire in english  the term being taken from the second french empire  at this time there was a strong gothic resurgence across europe and in france  the associated architect was eug xe8ne viollet-le-duc  in the late 19th century  gustave eiffel designed many bridges  such as garabit viaduct  and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time  although he is best remembered for the iconic eiffel tower   in the 20th century  french-swiss architect le corbusier designed several buildings in france  more recently  french architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles  the louvre pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building  the most difficult buildings to integrate within french cities are skyscrapers  as they are visible from afar  for instance  in paris  since 1977  new buildings had to be under 37 meters (121 feet   311  france s largest financial district is la defense  where a significant number of skyscrapers are located  312  other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges  an example of the way this has been done is the millau viaduct  some famous modern french architects include jean nouvel  dominique perrault  christian de portzamparc or paul andreu   the earliest french literature dates from the middle ages  when what is now known as modern france did not have a single  uniform language  there were several languages and dialects and writers used their own spelling and grammar  some authors of french mediaeval texts are unknown  such as tristan and iseult and lancelot-grail  other authors are known  for example chr xe9tien de troyes and duke william ix of aquitaine  who wrote in occitan   much mediaeval french poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the matter of france  such as the song of roland and the various chansons de geste  the roman de renart  written in 1175 by perrout de saint cloude  tells the story of the mediaeval character reynard   the fox   and is another example of early french writing   an important 16th-century writer was fran xe7ois rabelais  whose novel gargantua and pantagruel has remained famous and appreciated until now  michel de montaigne was the other major figure of the french literature during that century  his most famous work  essais  created the literary genre of the essay  313  french poetry during that century was embodied by pierre de ronsard and joachim du bellay  both writers founded the la pl xe9iade literary movement   during the 17th century  madame de la fayette published anonymously la princesse de cl xe8ves  a novel that is considered to be one of the very first psychological novels of all times  314  jean de la fontaine is one of the most famous fabulist of that time  as he wrote hundreds of fables  some being far more famous than others  such as the ant and the grasshopper  generations of french pupils had to learn his fables  that were seen as helping teaching wisdom and common sense to the young people  some of his verses have entered the popular language to become proverbs  citation needed   jean racine  whose incredible mastery of the alexandrine and of the french language has been praised for centuries  created plays such as ph xe8dre or britannicus  he is  along with pierre corneille  le
