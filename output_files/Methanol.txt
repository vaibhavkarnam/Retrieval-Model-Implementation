Methanol
 methanol (/\u02c8m u025b u03b8\u0259n u0252l    also known as methyl alcohol among others  is a chemical with the formula ch3oh  often abbreviated meoh   methanol acquired the name  wood alcohol  because it was once produced chiefly as a byproduct of the destructive distillation of wood  today  industrial methanol is produced in a catalytic process directly from carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide  and hydrogen   methanol is the simplest alcohol  being only a methyl group linked to a hydroxyl group  it is a light  volatile  colorless  flammable liquid with a distinctive odor very similar to that of ethanol  drinking alcohol   11  however  unlike ethanol  methanol is highly toxic and unfit for consumption  at room temperature  it is a polar liquid  and is used as an antifreeze  solvent  fuel  and as a denaturant for ethanol  it is also used for producing biodiesel via transesterification reaction   methanol is produced naturally in the anaerobic metabolism of many varieties of bacteria  and is commonly present in small amounts in the environment  as a result  the atmosphere contains a small amount of methanol vapor  but in only a few days  atmospheric methanol is oxidized by sunlight to produce carbon dioxide and water   methanol is also found in abundant quantities in star forming regions of space  and is used in astronomy as a marker for such regions  it is detected through its spectral emission lines  12   methanol when drunk is metabolized first to formaldehyde and then to formic acid or formate salts  13  these are poisonous to the central nervous system and may result in blindness  coma  and death  because of these toxic properties  methanol is frequently used as a denaturant additive for ethanol manufactured for industrial uses  this addition of methanol exempts industrial ethanol  commonly known as  denatured alcohol  or  methylated spirit   from liquor excise taxation in the us and some other countries   methanol is poisonous to the central nervous system and may cause blindness  coma  and death  however  in small amounts  methanol is a natural endogenous compound found in normal  healthy human individuals  concluded by one study which found a mean of 4.5\xa0ppm in the exhaled breath of subjects  14  the mean endogenous methanol in humans of 0.45 g d may be metabolized from pectin found in fruit  one kilogram of apple produces up to 1.4 g methanol  15   methanol has a high toxicity in humans  as little as 10\xa0ml of pure methanol  ingested  is metabolized into formic acid  which can cause permanent blindness by destruction of the optic nerve  thirty xa0ml is potentially fatal  16  although the median lethal dose is typically 100\xa0ml (3.4\xa0fl xa0oz   i e  1\u20132\xa0ml kg body weight of pure methanol 17    the reference dose for methanol is 2\xa0mg kg day  18  toxic effects begin hours after ingestion  and antidotes can often prevent permanent damage  16  because of its similarities in both appearance and odor to ethanol  the alcohol in beverages   it is difficult to differentiate between the two  such is also the case with denatured alcohol  adulterated liquors or very low quality alcoholic beverages   however  there are cases of methanol resistance  such as that of mike malloy who was the victim of a failed murder attempt by methanol in the early 1930s  19   methanol is toxic by two mechanisms  first  methanol  whether it enters the body by ingestion  inhalation  or absorption through the skin  can be fatal due to its cns depressant properties in the same manner as ethanol poisoning  second  in a process of toxication  it is metabolized to formic acid  which is present as the formate ion  via formaldehyde in a process initiated by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver  20  methanol is converted to formaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase  adh  and formaldehyde is converted to formic acid  formate  via aldehyde dehydrogenase  aldh   the conversion to formate via aldh proceeds completely  with no detectable formaldehyde remaining  21  formate is toxic because it inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase  causing hypoxia at the cellular level  and metabolic acidosis  among a variety of other metabolic disturbances  22   outbreaks of methanol poisoning have occurred due to contamination of drinking alcohol  this is more common in the developing world  23  in 2013 more than 1700 cases occurred in the united states  those affected are often adults males  24  outcomes may be good with early treatment  25  toxicity to methanol was described as early as 1856.[26   methanol is used primarily as a feedstock for the manufacture of chemicals  and as a fuel for specialized vehicles  as mentioned above  it is a common de-naturing agent  as a common laboratory solvent  is especially useful for hplc  uv vis spectroscopy  and lcms due to its low uv cutoff   methanol is primarily used in making other chemicals  about 40  of methanol is converted to formaldehyde  and from there into products as diverse as plastics  plywood  paints  explosives  and permanent press textiles   condensation of methanol molecules to produce hydrocarbon chains and even aromatic systems has been demonstrated with loss of water  carbon monoxide  and or carbon dioxide  loss of oxygen is prohibited on thermodynamic grounds   as early as 1880  an aromatisation reaction which generated hexamethylbenzene as a minor product with a mixture of mostly aliphatic hydrocarbons directly from methanol  using zinc chloride as catalyst  had been demonstrated  27][28  at 283\xa0\xb0c  the melting point of zncl2  the idealised reaction for the production of hexamethylbenzene has a \u0394g of \u2212261\xa0kcal xa0mol u22121.[27   in the early 1970s  a process was developed by mobil for producing gasoline fuel for vehicles  27  one such industrial facility was built at motunui in new zealand in the 1980s  in the 1990s  large amounts of methanol were used in the united states to produce the gasoline additive methyl tert-butyl ether  mtbe   while mtbe is no longer marketed in the u s   it is still widely used in other parts of the world  methanol  or less commonly  ethanol  is a component in the transesterification of triglycerides for production of biodiesel   other chemical derivatives of methanol include dimethyl ether  dme   which has replaced chlorofluorocarbons as an aerosol spray propellant  and acetic acid  dimethyl ether can be blended with liquified petroleum gas  lpg  for home heating and cooking  and can be used as a replacement for transportation diesel fuel   of high interest to the petrochemical marketplace  methanol is an important ingredient in new and lower-cost methods for producing propylene  which is much in demand  such methods include methanol-to-olefins  mto   methanol-to-propylene  mto mtp   metathesis  propane dehydrogenation  pdh   high severity fcc  and olefins cracking   the market for proponyl became tight when the ethane prices fell in the us with the exploration of shale gas reserves  the low priced ethylene produced from this raw material has given chemical producers in north america a feedstock advantage  such change has put naphtha-fed steam crackers at a disadvantageous position  with many of them shutting down or revamping to use ethane as feedstock  nevertheless  the propylene output rates from ethane-fed crackers are negligible  29   methanol is occasionally used to fuel internal combustion engines  pure methanol is required by rule to be used in champcars  monster trucks  usac sprint cars  as well as midgets  modifieds  etc    and other dirt track series  such as world of outlaws  and motorcycle speedway  mainly because  in the event of an accident  methanol does not produce an opaque cloud of smoke  since the late 1940s  methanol is also used as the primary fuel ingredient in the powerplants for radio control  control line  free flight airplanes  cars and trucks  such engines use a platinum filament glow plug that ignites the methanol vapor through a catalytic reaction  drag racers  mud racers  and heavily modified tractor pullers also use methanol as the primary fuel source  methanol is required with a supercharged engine in a top alcohol dragster and  until the end of the 2006 season  all vehicles in the indianapolis 500 had to run on methanol  as a fuel for mud racers  methanol mixed with gasoline and nitrous oxide produces more power than gasoline and nitrous oxide alone   methanol burns in oxygen  including open air  forming carbon dioxide and water   one problem with high concentrations of methanol in fuel is that alcohols corrode some metals  particularly aluminium  an acid  albeit weak  methanol attacks the oxide coating that normally protects the aluminium from corrosion   the resulting methoxide salts are soluble in methanol  resulting in a clean aluminium surface  which is readily oxidized by dissolved oxygen  also  the methanol can act as an oxidizer   this reciprocal process effectively fuels corrosion until either the metal is eaten away or the concentration of ch3oh is negligible  methanol s corrosivity has been addressed with methanol-compatible materials and fuel additives that serve as corrosion inhibitors   organic methanol  produced from wood or other organic materials  bioalcohol   has been suggested as a renewable alternative to petroleum-based hydrocarbons  low levels of methanol can be used in existing vehicles with the addition of cosolvents and corrosion inhibitors   methanol fuel has been proposed for ground transportation  the chief advantage of a methanol economy is that it could be adapted to gasoline internal combustion engines with minimum modification to the engines and to the infrastructure that delivers and stores liquid fuel   pure methanol has been used in open wheel auto racing since the mid-1960s  unlike petroleum fires  methanol fires can be extinguished with plain water  a methanol-based fire burns invisibly  unlike gasoline  which burns with a visible flame  if a fire occurs on the track  there is no flame or smoke to obstruct the view of fast approaching drivers  but this can also delay visual detection of the fire and the initiation of fire suppression  the decision to permanently switch to methanol in american indycar racing was a result of the devastating crash and explosion at the 1964 indianapolis 500  which killed drivers eddie sachs and dave macdonald  30  in 2007 indycars switched from methanol to ethanol  31   the european fuel quality directive allows up to 3  methanol with an equal amount of cosolvent to be blended with gasoline sold in europe  china uses more than one billion gallons of methanol per year as a transportation fuel in low level blends for conventional vehicles and high level blends in vehicles designed for methanol fuels   in the us  the open fuel standard act of 2011 was introduced in the us congress to encourage car manufacturers to build cars capable of using methanol  gasoline  or ethanol fuels  the bill is being championed by the open fuel standard coalition   stoichiometry for methanol production of syngas requires the ratio of h2   co to equal 2  the partial oxidation process yields a ratio of 2  and the steam reforming process yields a ratio of 3  the h2   co ratio can be lowered to some extent by the reverse water-gas shift reaction   to provide the appropriate stoichiometry for methanol synthesis   methanol is useful as an energy carrier because it is easier to store than hydrogen and burns cleaner than fossil fuels   methanol is readily biodegradable in both aerobic  oxygen present  and anaerobic  oxygen absent  environments  methanol will not persist in the environment  the half-life for methanol in groundwater is just one to seven days  while many common gasoline components have half-lives in the hundreds of days  such as benzene at 10\u2013730 days   since methanol is miscible with water and biodegradable  it is unlikely to accumulate in groundwater  surface water  air or soil  32   methanol is a traditional denaturant for ethanol  the product being known as  denatured alcohol  or  methylated spirit   this was commonly used during the prohibition to discourage consumption of bootlegged liquor  and ended up causing several deaths  33   methanol is used as a solvent and as an antifreeze in pipelines and windshield washer fluid   in some wastewater treatment plants  a small amount of methanol is added to wastewater to provide a carbon food source for the denitrifying bacteria  which convert nitrates to nitrogen gas and reduce the nitrification of sensitive aquifers   during world war ii  methanol was used as a fuel in several german military rocket designs  under the name m-stoff  and in a roughly 50/50 mixture with hydrazine  known as c-stoff   methanol was used as an automobile coolant antifreeze in the early 1900s  34   methanol is used as a destaining agent in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis   direct-methanol fuel cells are unique in their low temperature  atmospheric pressure operation  allowing them to be miniaturized to an unprecedented degree  35][36  this  combined with the relatively easy and safe storage and handling of methanol  may open the possibility of fuel cell-powered consumer electronics  such as laptop computers and mobile phones  37   methanol is also a widely used fuel in camping and boating stoves  methanol burns well in an unpressurized burner  so alcohol stoves are often very simple  sometimes little more than a cup to hold fuel  this lack of complexity makes them a favorite of hikers who spend extended time in the wilderness  similarly  the alcohol can be gelled to reduce risk of leaking or spilling  as with the brand  sterno    methanol is mixed with water and injected into high performance diesel and gasoline engines for an increase of power and a decrease in intake air temperature in a process known as water methanol injection   carbon monoxide and hydrogen react over a catalyst to produce methanol  today  the most widely used catalyst is a mixture of copper and zinc oxides  supported on alumina  as first used by ici in 1966  at 5\u201310 mpa (50\u2013100\xa0atm  and 250\xa0\xb0c (482\xa0\xb0f   the reaction is characterized by high selectivity (&gt 99.8     since the production of synthesis gas from methane produces three moles of hydrogen for every mole of carbon monoxide  whereas the synthesis consumes only two moles of hydrogen gas per mole of carbon monoxide  one way of dealing with the excess hydrogen is to inject carbon dioxide into the methanol synthesis reactor  where it  too  reacts to form methanol according to the equation   in terms of mechanism  the process occurs via initial conversion of co into co2  which is then hydrogenated  38   where the h2o byproduct is recycled via the water-gas shift reaction  this gives an overall reaction  which is the same as listed above   the catalytic conversion of methane to methanol has long been sought as a route to methanol  this route is effected by enzymes such as methane monooxygenases but commercial routes remain elusive because of the tendency for over-oxidation  i e   methanol is more readily oxidized than methane  39][40   methanol is available commercially in various purity grades for fine chemicals   in addition to laboratory grades  commercial methanol is generally classified according to astm purity grades a and aa  methanol for chemical use normally corresponds to grade aa  in addition to water  typical impurities include acetone and ethanol  which are very difficult to separate by distillation   when methanol is delivered by ships or tankers used to transport other substances  contamination by the previous cargo must be expected  comparative ultraviolet spectroscopy has proved a convenient  quick test method for deciding whether a batch can be accepted and loaded  traces of all chemicals derived from aromatic parent substances  as well as a large number of other compounds  can be detected  further tests for establishing the quality of methanol include measurements of boiling point range  density  permanganate number  turbidity  color index  and acid number  more comprehensive tests include water determination according to the karl fischer method and gas chromatographic determination of byproducts  however  the latter is relatively expensive and time-consuming because several injections using different columns and detectors must be made due to the variety of byproducts present   in their embalming process  the ancient egyptians used a mixture of substances  including methanol  which they obtained from the pyrolysis of wood  pure methanol  however  was first isolated in 1661 by robert boyle  when he produced it via the distillation of buxus (boxwood   41  it later became known as  pyroxylic spirit   in 1834  the french chemists jean-baptiste dumas and eugene peligot determined its elemental composition  42   they also introduced the word "methyl xe8ne  to organic chemistry  forming it from greek methy    alcoholic liquid    h u0233l u0113    wood  material   "methyl xe8ne  designated a  radical  that was about 14  hydrogen by weight and contained one carbon atom  this would be ch2  but at the time carbon was thought to have an atomic weight only six times that of hydrogen  so they gave the formula as ch  42  they then called wood alcohol  l esprit de bois   bihydrate de m xe9thyl xe8ne   bihydrate because they thought the formula was c4h8o4   (ch 4(h2o 2    the term  methyl  was derived in about 1840 by back-formation from  methylene   and was then applied to describe  methyl alcohol   this was shortened to  methanol  in 1892 by the international conference on chemical nomenclature  43  the suffix -yl used in organic chemistry to form names of carbon groups  was extracted from the word  methyl    in 1923  the german chemists alwin mittasch and mathias pier  working for badische-anilin  amp  soda-fabrik  basf   developed a means to convert synthesis gas  a mixture of carbon monoxide  carbon dioxide  and hydrogen  into methanol  us patent 1,569,775 was applied for on 4 sep 1924 and issued on 12 january 1926  the process used a chromium and manganese oxide catalyst with extremely vigorous conditions u2014pressures ranging from 50 to 220 atm  and temperatures up to 450\xa0\xb0c  modern methanol production has been made more efficient through use of catalysts  commonly copper  capable of operating at lower pressures  the modern low pressure methanol  lpm  was developed by ici in the late 1960s us 3326956\xa0 with the technology now owned by johnson matthey  which is a leading licensor of methanol technology   methanol is one of the most heavily traded chemical commodities in the world  with an estimated global demand of around 27 to 29 million metric tons  in recent years  production capacity has expanded considerably  with new plants coming on-stream in south america  china and the middle east  the latter based on access to abundant supplies of methane gas  even though nameplate production capacity  coal-based  in china has grown significantly  operating rates are estimated to be as low as 50 to 60   no new production capacity is scheduled to come on-stream until 2015   the main applications for methanol are the production of formaldehyde  used in construction and wooden boarding   acetic acid  basis for a o  pet-bottles   mtbe  fuel component and replacement for the very volatile diethyl ether  and more recently for the formation of methyl esters in the production of bio-diesel  in china  demand is expected to grow exponentially  not only caused by a growing internal market of the traditional applications  but accelerated by new applications  such as direct blending  with gasoline   methanol-to-olefins  e g  propylene  and dme  methanol can also be used to produce gasoline   the use of methanol as a motor fuel received attention during the oil crises of the 1970s due to its availability  low cost  and environmental benefits  by the mid-1990s  over 20,000 methanol  flexible fuel vehicles  capable of operating on methanol or gasoline were introduced in the u s  in addition  low levels of methanol were blended in gasoline fuels sold in europe during much of the 1980s and early-1990s  automakers stopped building methanol ffvs by the late-1990s  switching their attention to ethanol-fueled vehicles  while the methanol ffv program was a technical success  rising methanol pricing in the mid- to late-1990s during a period of slumping gasoline pump prices diminished the interest in methanol fuels  45   in 2006  astronomers using the merlin array of radio telescopes at jodrell bank observatory discovered a large cloud of methanol in space  288 billion miles across  46][47  in 2016  astronomers detected methyl alcohol in a planet-forming disc around the young star tw hydrae using alma radio telescope  48
