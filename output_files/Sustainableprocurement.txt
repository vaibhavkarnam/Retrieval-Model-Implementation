Sustainableprocurement
 procurement is the process of finding  acquiring  buying goods  services or works from an external source  often via a tendering or competitive bidding process  the process is used to ensure the buyer receives goods  services or works the best possible price  when aspects such as quality  quantity  time  and location are compared  1  procurement is considered sustainable when organizations broadens this framework by meeting their needs for goods  services  works  and utilities in a way that achieves value for money and promotes positive outcomes not only for the organization itself but for the economy  environment  and society  this framework is also known as the triple bottom line   sustainable procurement is a spending and investment process typically associated with public policy  although it is equally applicable to the private sector  organizations practicing sustainable procurement meet their needs for goods  services  utilities and works not on a private cost u2013benefit analysis  but with a view to maximizing net benefits for themselves and the wider world  in doing so they must incorporate extrinsic cost considerations into decisions alongside the conventional procurement criteria of price and quality  although in practice the sustainable impacts of a potential supplier s approach are often assessed as a form of quality consideration  these considerations are typically divided thus  environmental  economic and social   sustainable procurement involves a higher degree of collaboration and engagement between all parties in a supply chain  many businesses have adopted a broad interpretation of sustainable procurement and have developed tools and techniques to support this engagement and collaboration       procurement \u2013 the letting of contracts for goods  works and services on the best possible terms \u2013 has historically been based on two criteria  price and quality  with a view to maximizing benefits for the procuring organization  sustainable procurement broadens this framework to take account of third-party consequences of procurement decisions  forming a  triple baseline  of external concerns which the procuring organization must fulfill  2   environmental concerns are the dominant macro-level justification for sustainable procurement  born out of the growing 21st century consensus that humanity is placing excessive demands on available resources through unsustainable but well-established consumption patterns  these will involve non human factors   this is a sufficiently influential issue that environment-centric procurement  green procurement  is sometimes seen to stand alone from sustainable procurement  the most straightforward justification for green procurement is as a tool with which to address climate change  but it offers the broader capacity to mitigate over-exploitation of any and all scarce resources   examples of green procurement range from the purchase of energy-saving light-bulbs to the commissioning of a new building from renewable sourced timber via organic food being served in a workplace canteen  the ultimate green procurement is the avoidance of the purchase altogether   in support of sustainable development the organization should develop and publish a  sustainable development procurement guidelines and procedures   when it comes to purchasing products or services  referral to these guidelines would help make the organization become a leader in environmentally responsible purchasing  3][4   sustainable procurement is also used to address issues of social policy  such as inclusiveness  equality  international labor standards and diversity targets  regeneration and integration   examples include addressing the needs \u2013 whether employment  care  welfare or other \u2013 of groups including ethnic minorities  children  the elderly  those with disabilities  adults lacking basic skills  and immigrant populations   on a macroeconomic level  it can be argued that there are economic benefits in the form of efficiency gains from incorporating whole-life costing into decision-making   note  in contrast to most arguments from sustainable procurement proponents  these can be purely private benefits accrued by the procuring organization    in addition  the creation of sustainable markets is essential for long-term growth while sustainable development requirements foster innovation  there are also potential global applications  sustainable procurement can favor fair trade or ethical practice  and allow extra investment to channeled towards developing countries   on a micro economic level  sustainable procurement offers the chance for economic redistribution  targets might include creation of jobs and wealth in regeneration areas  or assistance for small and or ethnic minority-owned businesses   for central governments  sustainable procurement is typically viewed as the application of sustainable development criteria to spending and investment decisions  given high-profile socioeconomic and environmental concerns such as globalization and climate change  governments are increasingly concerned that our actions meet the needs of the present without compromising the needs of the future   public spending  which accounts for an average of 12  of gdp in oecd countries  and up to 30  in developing countries  wields enormous purchasing power  2  shifting that spending towards more sustainable goods and services can help drive markets in the direction of innovation and sustainability  thereby enabling the transition to a green economy  through sustainable procurement practices  governments can lead by example and deliver key policy objectives  sustainable procurement allows governments to mitigate key issues such as greenhouse gas emissions  improve resource efficiency  recycling  among others  the key international organizations already increasingly recon gnize public procurement as a means of changing the unsustainable patterns of consumption and production   the united nations  including its many affiliated agencies  recognize their own responsibilities in contributing to more sustainable patterns of development  maintaining a market behavior which is credible  inspirational and exemplary  and proving that un agencies stand behind the principles they promote  5  through the development of procurement criteria that support sustainability principles  requisitioners and procurers can send strong signals to the market in favor of goods and services that promote sustainability  the united nations agency destined to develop and promote resource efficiency and more sustainable consumption and production processes  including the promotion of sustainable resource management in a life cycle perspective for goods and services in both developed and developing countries  the united nations environmental programme  unep  drafted sustainable public procurement implementation guideline to aid in the consideration of society  economy  and the environment in procurement processes 2   the marrakech task force on sustainable public procurement  mtf or spp  which was managed by switzerland from 2006 to may 2011 established an approach for the effective implementation of sustainable procurement  this approach was named the mtf approach to spp  since then  the united nations environmental programme have worked together with the swiss government to develop a project to implement sustainable procurement worldwide  the project named capacity building for sustainable public procurement in developing countries were piloted in 7 different countries  chile  colombia  costa rica  lebanon  mauritius  tunisia  and uruguay and since then  the list of countries adopting this newly designed approach to developing has increase adding even more advanced and industrialized nations to be used as case studies to measure the efficiency and benefits of the implementation of sustainable public procurement  in brazil  the project involved recycled paper  in costa rica  the management services was redesigned  toner cartridges for laser printers was the main objective in france  in hong kong and china the nations aimed to improve traffic with led traffic lights retrofit  organic food for school children in italy  sustainable construction in england  consultancy and temporary staff services was renovated in scotland  and in the united states  there was a push for the sustainable transportation of waste  7   the eight case studies reveal a diversity of environmental impacts at various stages of the products u2019 life cycle  the purchase of remanufactured ink cartridges by the french ministry of education has led to a decrease in the amount of waste generated at the manufacturing stage  the construction or services case studies  yorkshire and humber region  uk  and oregon  usa  demonstrate significant impacts related to the reduction of co2 emissions  of waste production  and of water consumption  the ferrara study  italy  and the recycled paper case (s xe3o paulo  brazil  show positive environmental  7   although the social component of sustainable development has often been considered as the most neglected one  the eight case studies show a strong commitment from public purchasers to tackle social issues  employment and social inclusiveness issues are considered essential by the public entities who promote these priorities through their procurement processes  some of the social impacts are directly targeted by tenders  such as the participation of companies employing disabled persons in the french case or the fight against illiteracy in scotland  other impacts are the results of the specific purchase  as in the state of s xe3o paulo case  notebooks using recycled paper  which demonstrates a clear positive impact for waste pickers  the analysis of the case studies illustrates the diversity and strength of the recorded sustainable development impacts  public purchasers can be clearly seen as key potential actors of society  able to impact a wide range of sustainable development fields  7   the uk in 2005 pledged to be a performance-leader in sustainable procurement by 2009 and commissioned the business-led sustainable procurement task force to formulate appropriate strategy  8  broad-based procurement strategies are prominent across the eu 9  while it is an increasingly influential concern elsewhere  most notably canada  10  the us federal government requires certain green procurement practices in its buildings and supports the wide and inclusive use of them  the general services administration  an independent establishment and government corporation  is responsible for promoting green procurement and provides federal agencies with selling and purchasing guidelines and suggestions  green procurement is primarily done by federal contracting personnel and program managers \u2013 but it is not restricted to such professionals  11   at market-level  sustainable procurement is typically instrumental  authorities seek to address policy through procurement  12   government departments and local bodies can use procurement to address certain chosen agendas in buying solutions that will contribute to community or environmental goals  or to diversity or equality targets   to help local governments improve sustainability and reduce environmental impacts the california sustainability alliance  has developed a green procurement toolkit  13  green procurement can help local governments save money  create local green jobs and improve their environmental sustainability   under sustainable procurement criteria any procuring organization must therefore take a broad approach to sustainability  reflecting localized economic  environmental and social needs as well as cross-cutting sustainable development strategies such as life cycle assessment  14   iclei is a membership organization of local governments who recognize the power of public sustainable procurement to achieve environmental  social and economic benefits  it encourages public procurement of innovation as a means for achieving sustainability  among its various activities  it offers a sustainable procurement resource center and a procurement of innovation platform which can be used by procurers or by anyone interested in these topics   on december 8  2006 the greater london authority became the first public-sector body to publish a sustainable procurement policy  15  promising to award a  distinct competitive advantage  to those companies which demonstrated a commitment to sustainable procurement concerns  16  the policy reflected the mayor s enthusiasm for public procurement as a tool for fostering social inclusion  equality and environmental objectives   the gla also stated that their policy was  very much as a model for broader government procurement  but this expectation was not fulfilled in the uk government s sustainable procurement action plan  published on march 5  2007.[17  the action plan  which incorporated answers to the sustainable procurement task force  was explicitly environment-oriented in approach  ch 4.3  with wider social issues scarcely addressed   this was perhaps surprising  as was press disinterest in the publication  despite its acknowledged importance among senior politicians and business leaders  publication of the action plan received only one national newspaper report  and that was markedly flippant in tone  18   sustainable procurement outside of the united nations is happening everywhere  in the international community  in states and local authorities  in the private sector and in the civil society  sustainable procurement is as applicable to the private sector as the public sector  and certainly its proponents aspire to seeing its application across all areas of the economy due to a vast amount of material available on the internet for organizations and companies wishing to improve their sustainability performance  influencing procurement practice within a private-sector firm is not straightforward for governments  meaning that the companies themselves often have to be self-motivated to embrace sustainability  it becomes a social responsibility for both businesses and workers to promote sustainable procurement in the workplace   the uk s sustainable procurement national action plan argues that it is  something the best of the private sector is already doing \u2013 whether through enlightened leadership or shareholder pressure   19  it also argues that government purchasing power  circa \xa3150bn in the uk alone  can apply sustainable procurement principles to present a persuasive case to those in the private sector resisting sustainable procurement practice   fair trade and sustainable procurement demands the implementation of responsible practices in relation to workers  environment and society to be followed by suppliers as to promote a chain of sustainability between production and consumption  20   while there is no strict definition on how organizations implement sustainable procurement  there are two approaches that can be combined   this is where an organization examines a products movement along the supply chain and assesses the environmental credentials of themselves and of their suppliers  this path is commonly used when an organization wishes to understand the impact of a product or product range for strategic and marketing purposes  this approach can also provide a vivid picture of supplier processes   an organization may analyze the csr management systems of a supplier and whether its practices conform with law and with the csr standards of  buying  organization  thus  the organization measures the environmental and social risk a supplier may impose upon them  implemented effectively  this method will show whether a supplier meets the environmental standards of the organization  along with whether suppliers are meeting the requirements of law  in order to assess the csr management systems companies can use a variety of tools xa0
