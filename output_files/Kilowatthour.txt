Kilowatthour
 the kilowatt-hour  symbol kwh  1  kw u22c5h or kw xa0h 2   is a derived unit of energy equal to 3.6\xa0megajoules  3][4  if the energy is being transmitted or used at a constant rate  power  over a period of time  the total energy in kilowatt-hours is the power in kilowatts multiplied by the time in hours  the kilowatt-hour is commonly used as a billing unit for energy delivered to consumers by electric utilities       the kilowatt-hour  symbolized kw u22c5h as per si  is a composite unit of energy equivalent to one kilowatt (1\xa0kw  of power sustained for one hour   one watt is equal to 1\xa0j s  one kilowatt-hour is 3.6\xa0megajoules  which is the amount of energy converted if work is done at an average rate of one thousand watts for one hour   the base unit of energy within the international system of units  si  is the joule  the hour is a unit of time  outside the si   making the kilowatt-hour a non-si unit of energy  the kilowatt-hour is not listed among the non-si units accepted by the bipm for use with the si  although the hour  from which the kilowatt-hour is derived  is  5   an electric heater rated at 1000 watts (1 kilowatt   operating for one hour uses one kilowatt-hour  equivalent to 3.6 megajoules  of energy  a television rated at 100 watts operating for 10 hours continuously uses one kilowatt-hour  a 40-watt light bulb operating continuously for 25 hours uses one kilowatt-hour   electrical energy is sold in kilowatt-hours  cost of running equipment is the product of power in kilowatts multiplied by running time in hours and price per kilowatt-hour  the unit price of electricity may depend upon the rate of consumption and the time of day  industrial users may also have extra charges according to their peak usage and the power factor   the symbol  kwh  is commonly used in commercial  educational  scientific and media publications  6  and is the usual practice in electrical power engineering  7   other abbreviations and symbols may be encountered   to convert a quantity measured in a unit in the left column to the units in the top row  multiply by the factor in the cell where the row and column intersect   all the si prefixes are commonly applied to the watt-hour  a kilowatt-hour is 1,000 w xb7h  symbols kw xb7h  kwh or kw h  a megawatt-hour is 1 million w xb7h   symbols mw xb7h  mwh or mw h   a milliwatt-hour is 1/1000 w xb7h  symbols mw xb7h  mwh or mw h  and so on  the kilowatt-hour is commonly used by electrical distribution providers for purposes of billing  since the monthly energy consumption of a typical residential customer ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand kilowatt-hours  megawatt-hours  mwh   gigawatt-hours  gwh   and terawatt-hours  twh  are often used for metering larger amounts of electrical energy to industrial customers and in power generation  the terawatt-hour and petawatt-hour  pwh  units are large enough to conveniently express the annual electricity generation for whole countries     the terms power and energy are frequently confused  power is defined as the rate of delivery of energy  the work performed per unit time  measured in units joules per second or watts  to produce power over any period of time requires energy  either higher levels of power for a given period or longer periods of run time at a given power level require more energy   an electrical load  e g  a lamp  tv-set  electric motor  has a rated size in watts  this is its running power level  which equates to the instantaneous rate at which energy must be generated and consumed to run the device  the amount of energy that is consumed at that rate depends on how long the device is operated  however  its power requirements are constant while running  the unit of energy for residential electrical billing  kilowatt-hours  integrates changing power levels in use at the residence over the past billing period  which is nominally 720 hours for a 30-day month  thus showing cumulative electrical energy use for the month   for another example  when a light bulb with a power rating of 100 watts is turned on for one hour  the energy used is 100 watt-hours (w xb7h   0.1 kilowatt-hour  or 360 kilojoules  this same amount of energy would light a 40-watt bulb for 2.5 hours  or a 10-watt low-energy bulb for 10 hours  a power station electricity output at any particular moment would be measured in multiples of watts  but its annual energy sales would be in multiples of watt-hours  a kilowatt-hour is the amount of energy equivalent to a steady power of 1 kilowatt running for 1 hour  or 3.6 megajoules   energy cost can be illustrated in a similar example  a 100-watt  i e  0.1 kilowatt  light bulb turned on for 8 hours uses 800\xa0w u22c5h or 0.8\xa0kw u22c5h  if the energy cost is 25 cents per kilowatt-hour  it would cost 0.1\xa0kw \xd7 8\xa0h \xd7 $0.25/kw u22c5h   $0.20   whereas individual homes only pay for the kilowatt-hours consumed  commercial buildings and institutions also pay for peak power consumption  the greatest power recorded in a fairly short time  such as 15 minutes  this compensates the power company for maintaining the infrastructure needed to provide peak power  these charges are billed as demand charges  12   major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt-hours (tw u22c5h  for a given period that is often a calendar year or financial year  one terawatt-hour is equal to a sustained power of approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one year   power units measure the rate of energy per unit time  many compound units for rates explicitly mention units of time  for example  miles per hour  kilometers per hour  dollars per hour  kilowatt-hours are a product of power and time  not a rate of change of power with time  watts per hour  w h  is a unit of a change of power per hour  it might be used to characterize the ramp-up behavior of power plants  for example  a power plant that reaches a power output of 1\xa0mw from 0\xa0mw in 15 minutes has a ramp-up rate of 4\xa0mw h  hydroelectric power plants have a very high ramp-up rate  which makes them particularly useful in peak load and emergency situations   the proper use of terms such as watts per hour is uncommon  whereas misuse 13  may be widespread   several other units are commonly used to indicate power or energy capacity or use in specific application areas   average annual power production or consumption can be expressed in kilowatt-hours per year  for example  when comparing the energy efficiency of household appliances whose power consumption varies with time or the season of the year  or the energy produced by a distributed power source  one kilowatt-hour per year equals about 114.08 milliwatts applied constantly during one year   the energy content of a battery is usually expressed indirectly by its capacity in ampere-hours  to convert watt-hours (w xb7h  to ampere hour (a xb7h   the watt-hour value must be divided by the voltage of the power source  this value is approximate  since the voltage is not constant during discharge of a battery  and because higher discharge rates reduce the total amount of energy the battery can provide  in the case of devices that output a different voltage than the battery  it is the battery voltage  typically 3.7 for li-ion  that must be used to calculate rather than the device output  usually 5.0 for usb portable chargers   since use of the lower figure allows manufacturers of such devices to overstate the capacity or run-time  inflating it by 35  (\u200a5\u20443.7=1.35   this results in a 500ma usb device running for only about 3.7 hours on a 2500mah battery  rather than the expected five hours   the board of trade unit  botu  is an obsolete uk synonym for kilowatt-hour  the term derives from the name of the board of trade which regulated the electricity industry until 1942 when the ministry of power took over  14  the b o t u  should not be confused with the british thermal unit or btu  which is a much smaller quantity of thermal energy   in india  the kilowatt-hour is often simply called a unit of energy  a million units  designated mu  is a gigawatt-hour and a bu  billion units  is a terawatt-hour  15][16   burnup of nuclear fuel is normally quoted in megawatt days per tonne (mw xb7d mtu   where tonne refers to a metric ton of uranium metal or its equivalent  and megawatt refers to the entire thermal output  not the fraction which is converted to electricity  citation needed
