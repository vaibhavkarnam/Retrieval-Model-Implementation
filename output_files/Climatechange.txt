Climatechange
 atmospheric physics natmospheric dynamics  category   weather (category  xa0\xb7  portal   climate  category  nclimate change  category   climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time  i e   decades to millions of years   climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions  or in the time variation of weather around longer-term average conditions  i e   more or fewer extreme weather events   climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes  variations in solar radiation received by earth  plate tectonics  and volcanic eruptions  certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change  often referred to as global warming  1   scientists actively work to understand past and future climate by using observations and theoretical models  a climate record u2014extending deep into the earth s past u2014has been assembled  and continues to be built up  based on geological evidence from borehole temperature profiles  cores removed from deep accumulations of ice  floral and faunal records  glacial and periglacial processes  stable-isotope and other analyses of sediment layers  and records of past sea levels  more recent data are provided by the instrumental record  general circulation models  based on the physical sciences  are often used in theoretical approaches to match past climate data  make future projections  and link causes and effects in climate change       the most general definition of climate change is a change in the statistical properties  principally its mean and spread  2  of the climate system when considered over long periods of time  regardless of cause  3  accordingly  fluctuations over periods shorter than a few decades  such as el ni xf1o  do not represent climate change   the term sometimes is used to refer specifically to climate change caused by human activity  as opposed to changes in climate that may have resulted as part of earth s natural processes  4  in this sense  especially in the context of environmental policy  the term climate change has become synonymous with anthropogenic global warming  within scientific journals  global warming refers to surface temperature increases while climate change includes global warming and everything else that increasing greenhouse gas levels affect  5   a related term is  climatic change   in 1966  the world meteorological organization  wmo  proposed the term  climatic change  to encompass all forms of climatic variability on time-scales longer than 10 years  regardless of cause  change was a given and climatic was used as an adjective to describe this kind of change  as opposed to political or economic change   when it was realized that human activities had a potential to drastically alter the climate  the term climate change replaced climatic change as the dominant term to reflect an anthropogenic cause  climate change was incorporated in the title of the intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  and the un framework convention on climate change  unfccc   climate change  used as a noun  became an issue rather than the technical description of changing weather  6   on the broadest scale  the rate at which energy is received from the sun and the rate at which it is lost to space determine the equilibrium temperature and climate of earth  this energy is distributed around the globe by winds  ocean currents  and other mechanisms to affect the climates of different regions   factors that can shape climate are called climate forcings or  forcing mechanisms   7  these include processes such as variations in solar radiation  variations in the earth s orbit  variations in the albedo or reflectivity of the continents  atmosphere  and oceans  mountain-building and continental drift and changes in greenhouse gas concentrations  there are a variety of climate change feedbacks that can either amplify or diminish the initial forcing  some parts of the climate system  such as the oceans and ice caps  respond more slowly in reaction to climate forcings  while others respond more quickly  there are also key threshold factors which when exceeded can produce rapid change   forcing mechanisms can be either  internal  or  external   internal forcing mechanisms are natural processes within the climate system itself  e g   the thermohaline circulation   external forcing mechanisms can be either natural  e g   changes in solar output  the earth s orbit  volcano eruptions  or anthropogenic  e g  increased emissions of greenhouse gases and dust    whether the initial forcing mechanism is internal or external  the response of the climate system might be fast  e g   a sudden cooling due to airborne volcanic ash reflecting sunlight   slow  e g  thermal expansion of warming ocean water   or a combination  e g   sudden loss of albedo in the arctic ocean as sea ice melts  followed by more gradual thermal expansion of the water   therefore  the climate system can respond abruptly  but the full response to forcing mechanisms might not be fully developed for centuries or even longer   scientists generally define the five components of earth s climate system to include atmosphere  hydrosphere  cryosphere  lithosphere  restricted to the surface soils  rocks  and sediments   and biosphere  8  natural changes in the climate system   internal forcings   result in internal  climate variability   9  examples include the type and distribution of species  and changes in ocean-atmosphere circulations   the ocean and atmosphere can work together to spontaneously generate internal climate variability that can persist for years to decades at a time  10][11  examples of this type of variability include the el ni xf1o-southern oscillation  the pacific decadal oscillation  and the atlantic multidecadal oscillation  these variations can affect global average surface temperature by redistributing heat between the deep ocean and the atmopshere 12][13  and or by altering the cloud water vapor sea ice distribution which can affect the total energy budget of the earth  14][15   the oceanic aspects of these circulations can generate variability on centennial timescales due to the ocean having hundreds of times more mass than in the atmosphere  and thus very high thermal inertia  for example  alterations to ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation play a key role in redistributing heat in the world s oceans  due to the long timescales of this circulation  ocean temperature at depth is still adjusting to effects of the little ice age 16  which occurred between the 1600 and 1800s   life affects climate through its role in the carbon and water cycles and through such mechanisms as albedo  evapotranspiration  cloud formation  and weathering  17][18][19  examples of how life may have affected past climate include   slight variations in earth s orbit lead to changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the earth s surface and how it is distributed across the globe  there is very little change to the area-averaged annually averaged sunshine  but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution  the three types of orbital variations are variations in earth s eccentricity  changes in the tilt angle of earth s axis of rotation  and precession of earth s axis  combined together  these produce milankovitch cycles which have a large impact on climate and are notable for their correlation to glacial and interglacial periods  30  their correlation with the advance and retreat of the sahara  30  and for their appearance in the stratigraphic record  31][32   the ipcc notes that milankovitch cycles drove the ice age cycles  co2 followed temperature change  with a lag of some hundreds of years   and that as a feedback amplified temperature change  33  the depths of the ocean have a lag time in changing temperature  thermal inertia on such scale   upon seawater temperature change  the solubility of co2 in the oceans changed  as well as other factors impacting air-sea co2 exchange  34   the sun is the predominant source of energy input to the earth  other sources include geothermal energy from the earth s core  and heat from the decay of radioactive compounds  both long- and short-term variations in solar intensity are known to affect global climate   three to four billion years ago  the sun emitted only 70  as much power as it does today  if the atmospheric composition had been the same as today  liquid water should not have existed on earth  however  there is evidence for the presence of water on the early earth  in the hadean 35][36  and archean 37][35  eons  leading to what is known as the faint young sun paradox  38  hypothesized solutions to this paradox include a vastly different atmosphere  with much higher concentrations of greenhouse gases than currently exist  39  over the following approximately 4 billion years  the energy output of the sun increased and atmospheric composition changed  the great oxygenation event xa0\u2013 oxygenation of the atmosphere around 2.4 billion years ago xa0\u2013 was the most notable alteration  over the next five billion years  the sun s ultimate death as it becomes a red giant and then a white dwarf will have large effects on climate  with the red giant phase possibly ending any life on earth that survives until that time   solar output also varies on shorter time scales  including the 11-year solar cycle 40  and longer-term modulations  41  solar intensity variations possibly as a result of the wolf  sp xf6rer and maunder minimum are considered to have been influential in triggering the little ice age  42  and some of the warming observed from 1900 to 1950  the cyclical nature of the sun s energy output is not yet fully understood  it differs from the very slow change that is happening within the sun as it ages and evolves  research indicates that solar variability has had effects including the maunder minimum from 1645 to 1715 a d   part of the little ice age from 1550 to 1850 a d  that was marked by relative cooling and greater glacier extent than the centuries before and afterward  43][44  some studies point toward solar radiation increases from cyclical sunspot activity affecting global warming  and climate may be influenced by the sum of all effects  solar variation  anthropogenic radiative forcings  etc    45][46   interestingly  a 2010 study 47  suggests  \u201cthat the effects of solar variability on temperature throughout the atmosphere may be contrary to current expectations  u201d  in an aug 2011 press release  48  cern announced the publication in the nature journal the initial results from its cloud experiment  the results indicate that ionisation from cosmic rays significantly enhances aerosol formation in the presence of sulfuric acid and water  but in the lower atmosphere where ammonia is also required  this is insufficient to account for aerosol formation and additional trace vapours must be involved  the next step is to find more about these trace vapours  including whether they are of natural or human origin   the eruptions considered to be large enough to affect the earth s climate on a scale of more than 1 year are the ones that inject over 100,000 tons of so2 into the stratosphere  49  this is due to the optical properties of so2 and sulfate aerosols  which strongly absorb or scatter solar radiation  creating a global layer of sulfuric acid haze  50  on average  such eruptions occur several times per century  and cause cooling  by partially blocking the transmission of solar radiation to the earth s surface  for a period of a few years   the eruption of mount pinatubo in 1991  the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century  affected the climate substantially  subsequently global temperatures decreased by about 0.5\xa0\xb0c (0.9\xa0\xb0f  for up to three years  51][52  thus  the cooling over large parts of the earth reduced surface temperatures in 1991\u201393  the equivalent to a reduction in net radiation of 4 watts per square meter  53  the mount tambora eruption in 1815 caused the year without a summer  54  much larger eruptions  known as large igneous provinces  occur only a few times every fifty \u2013 hundred million years \u2013 through flood basalt  and caused in earth past global warming and mass extinctions  55   small eruptions  with injections of less than 0.1 mt of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere  impact the atmosphere only subtly  as temperature changes are comparable with natural variability  however  because smaller eruptions occur at a much higher frequency  they too have a significant impact on earth s atmosphere  49][56   seismic monitoring maps current and future trends in volcanic activities  and tries to develop early warning systems  in climate modelling the aim is to study the physical mechanisms and feedbacks of volcanic forcing  57   volcanoes are also part of the extended carbon cycle  over very long  geological  time periods  they release carbon dioxide from the earth s crust and mantle  counteracting the uptake by sedimentary rocks and other geological carbon dioxide sinks  the us geological survey estimates are that volcanic emissions are at a much lower level than the effects of current human activities  which generate 100\u2013300 times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoes  58  a review of published studies indicates that annual volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide  including amounts released from mid-ocean ridges  volcanic arcs  and hot spot volcanoes  are only the equivalent of 3 to 5 days of human caused output  the annual amount put out by human activities may be greater than the amount released by supererruptions  the most recent of which was the toba eruption in indonesia 74,000 years ago  59   although volcanoes are technically part of the lithosphere  which itself is part of the climate system  the ipcc explicitly defines volcanism as an external forcing agent  60   over the course of millions of years  the motion of tectonic plates reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topography  this can affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphere-ocean circulation  61   the position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation  the locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe  and therefore  in determining global climate  a recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the isthmus of panama about 5 million years ago  which shut off direct mixing between the atlantic and pacific oceans  this strongly affected the ocean dynamics of what is now the gulf stream and may have led to northern hemisphere ice cover  62][63  during the carboniferous period  about 300 to 360 million years ago  plate tectonics may have triggered large-scale storage of carbon and increased glaciation  64  geologic evidence points to a  megamonsoonal  circulation pattern during the time of the supercontinent pangaea  and climate modeling suggests that the existence of the supercontinent was conducive to the establishment of monsoons  65   the size of continents is also important  because of the stabilizing effect of the oceans on temperature  yearly temperature variations are generally lower in coastal areas than they are inland  a larger supercontinent will therefore have more area in which climate is strongly seasonal than will several smaller continents or islands   in the context of climate variation  anthropogenic factors are human activities which affect the climate  the scientific consensus on climate change is  that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities   66  and it  is largely irreversible   67   \u201cscience has made enormous inroads in understanding climate change and its causes  and is beginning to help develop a strong understanding of current and potential impacts that will affect people today and in coming decades  this understanding is crucial because it allows decision makers to place climate change in the context of other large challenges facing the nation and the world  there are still some uncertainties  and there always will be in understanding a complex system like earth u2019s climate  nevertheless  there is a strong  credible body of evidence  based on multiple lines of research  documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities  while much remains to be learned  the core phenomenon  scientific questions  and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanations  u201d  of most concern in these anthropogenic factors is the increase in co2 levels due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion  followed by aerosols  particulate matter in the atmosphere  and the co2 released by cement manufacture  other factors  including land use  ozone depletion  animal agriculture 68  and deforestation  are also of concern in the roles they play xa0\u2013 both separately and in conjunction with other factors xa0\u2013 in affecting climate  microclimate  and measures of climate variables  69   evidence for climatic change is taken from a variety of sources that can be used to reconstruct past climates  reasonably complete global records of surface temperature are available beginning from the mid-late 19th century  for earlier periods  most of the evidence is indirect u2014climatic changes are inferred from changes in proxies  indicators that reflect climate  such as vegetation  ice cores  71  dendrochronology  sea level change  and glacial geology   the instrumental temperature record from surface stations was supplemented by radiosonde balloons  extensive atmospheric monitoring by the mid-20th century  and  from the 1970s on  with global satellite data as well  the 18o 16o ratio in calcite and ice core samples used to deduce ocean temperature in the distant past is an example of a temperature proxy method  as are other climate metrics noted in subsequent categories   climate change in the recent past may be detected by corresponding changes in settlement and agricultural patterns  72  archaeological evidence  oral history and historical documents can offer insights into past changes in the climate  climate change effects have been linked to the collapse of various civilizations  72   glaciers are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate change  73  their size is determined by a mass balance between snow input and melt output  as temperatures warm  glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation increases to make up for the additional melt  the converse is also true   glaciers grow and shrink due both to natural variability and external forcings  variability in temperature  precipitation  and englacial and subglacial hydrology can strongly determine the evolution of a glacier in a particular season  therefore  one must average over a decadal or longer time-scale and or over many individual glaciers to smooth out the local short-term variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climate   a world glacier inventory has been compiled since the 1970s  initially based mainly on aerial photographs and maps but now relying more on satellites  this compilation tracks more than 100,000 glaciers covering a total area of approximately 240,000\xa0km2  and preliminary estimates indicate that the remaining ice cover is around 445,000\xa0km2  the world glacier monitoring service collects data annually on glacier retreat and glacier mass balance  from this data  glaciers worldwide have been found to be shrinking significantly  with strong glacier retreats in the 1940s  stable or growing conditions during the 1920s and 1970s  and again retreating from the mid-1980s to present  74   the most significant climate processes since the middle to late pliocene  approximately 3 million years ago  are the glacial and interglacial cycles  the present interglacial period  the holocene  has lasted about 11,700 years  75  shaped by orbital variations  responses such as the rise and fall of continental ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climate  other changes  including heinrich events  dansgaard u2013oeschger events and the younger dryas  however  illustrate how glacial variations may also influence climate without the orbital forcing   glaciers leave behind moraines that contain a wealth of material u2014including organic matter  quartz  and potassium that may be dated u2014recording the periods in which a glacier advanced and retreated  similarly  by tephrochronological techniques  the lack of glacier cover can be identified by the presence of soil or volcanic tephra horizons whose date of deposit may also be ascertained   the decline in arctic sea ice  both in extent and thickness  over the last several decades is further evidence for rapid climate change  76  sea ice is frozen seawater that floats on the ocean surface  it covers millions of square miles in the polar regions  varying with the seasons  in the arctic  some sea ice remains year after year  whereas almost all southern ocean or antarctic sea ice melts away and reforms annually  satellite observations show that arctic sea ice is now declining at a rate of 13.3 percent per decade  relative to the 1981 to 2010 average  77   a change in the type  distribution and coverage of vegetation may occur given a change in the climate  some changes in climate may result in increased precipitation and warmth  resulting in improved plant growth and the subsequent sequestration of airborne co2  a gradual increase in warmth in a region will lead to earlier flowering and fruiting times  driving a change in the timing of life cycles of dependent organisms  conversely  cold will cause plant bio-cycles to lag  78  larger  faster or more radical changes  however  may result in vegetation stress  rapid plant loss and desertification in certain circumstances  79][80  an example of this occurred during the carboniferous rainforest collapse  crc   an extinction event 300 million years ago  at this time vast rainforests covered the equatorial region of europe and america  climate change devastated these tropical rainforests  abruptly fragmenting the habitat into isolated  islands  and causing the extinction of many plant and animal species  79   even though this is a field with many uncertainties  it is expected that over the next 50 years climate changes will have an effect on the diversity of forest genetic resources and thereby on the distribution of forest tree species and the composition of forests  diversity of forest genetic resources enables the potential for a species  or a population  to adapt to climatic changes and related future challenges such as temperature changes  drought  pests  diseases and forest fire  however  species are not naturally capable to adapt in the pace of which the climate is changing and the increasing temperatures will most likely facilitate the spread of pests and diseases  creating an additional threat to forest trees and their populations  81  to inhibit these problems human interventions  such as transfer of forest reproductive material  may be needed  82   palynology is the study of contemporary and fossil palynomorphs  including pollen  palynology is used to infer the geographical distribution of plant species  which vary under different climate conditions  different groups of plants have pollen with distinctive shapes and surface textures  and since the outer surface of pollen is composed of a very resilient material  they resist decay  changes in the type of pollen found in different layers of sediment in lakes  bogs  or river deltas indicate changes in plant communities  these changes are often a sign of a changing climate  83][84  as an example  palynological studies have been used to track changing vegetation patterns throughout the quaternary glaciations 85  and especially since the last glacial maximum  86   past precipitation can be estimated in the modern era with the global network of precipitation gauges  surface coverage over oceans and remote areas is relatively sparse  but  reducing reliance on interpolation  satellite clouds and precipitation data has been available since the 1970s  88  quantification of climatological variation of precipitation in prior centuries and epochs is less complete but approximated using proxies such as marine sediments  ice cores  cave stalagmites  and tree rings  89  in july 2016 scientists published evidence of increased cloud cover over polar regions  90  as predicted by climate models  91   climatological temperatures substantially affect cloud cover and precipitation  for instance  during the last glacial maximum of 18,000 years ago  thermal-driven evaporation from the oceans onto continental landmasses was low  causing large areas of extreme desert  including polar deserts  cold but with low rates of cloud cover and precipitation   87  in contrast  the world s climate was cloudier and wetter than today near the start of the warm atlantic period of 8000 years ago  87   estimated global land precipitation increased by approximately 2  over the course of the 20th century  though the calculated trend varies if different time endpoints are chosen  complicated by enso and other oscillations  including greater global land cloud cover precipitation in the 1950s and 1970s than the later 1980s and 1990s despite the positive trend over the century overall  88][92][93  similar slight overall increase in global river runoff and in average soil moisture has been perceived  92   dendroclimatology is the analysis of tree ring growth patterns to determine past climate variations  94  wide and thick rings indicate a fertile  well-watered growing period  whilst thin  narrow rings indicate a time of lower rainfall and less-than-ideal growing conditions   analysis of ice in a core drilled from an ice sheet such as the antarctic ice sheet  can be used to show a link between temperature and global sea level variations  the air trapped in bubbles in the ice can also reveal the co2 variations of the atmosphere from the distant past  well before modern environmental influences  the study of these ice cores has been a significant indicator of the changes in co2 over many millennia  and continues to provide valuable information about the differences between ancient and modern atmospheric conditions   remains of beetles are common in freshwater and land sediments  different species of beetles tend to be found under different climatic conditions  given the extensive lineage of beetles whose genetic makeup has not altered significantly over the millennia  knowledge of the present climatic range of the different species  and the age of the sediments in which remains are found  past climatic conditions may be inferred  95   similarly  the historical abundance of various fish species has been found to have a substantial relationship with observed climatic conditions  96  changes in the primary productivity of autotrophs in the oceans can affect marine food webs  97   global sea level change for much of the last century has generally been estimated using tide gauge measurements collated over long periods of time to give a long-term average  more recently  altimeter measurements xa0\u2014 in combination with accurately determined satellite orbits xa0\u2014 have provided an improved measurement of global sea level change  98  to measure sea levels prior to instrumental measurements  scientists have dated coral reefs that grow near the surface of the ocean  coastal sediments  marine terraces  ooids in limestones  and nearshore archaeological remains  the predominant dating methods used are uranium series and radiocarbon  with cosmogenic radionuclides being sometimes used to date terraces that have experienced relative sea level fall  in the early pliocene  global temperatures were 1\u20132\u02dac warmer than the present temperature  yet sea level was 15\u201325 meters higher than today  99   climate of recent glaciations  climate of the past  recent climate
