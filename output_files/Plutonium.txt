Plutonium
 plutonium is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with symbol pu and atomic number 94  it is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air  and forms a dull coating when oxidized  the element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states  it reacts with carbon  halogens  nitrogen  silicon and hydrogen  when exposed to moist air  it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70  in volume  which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric  it is radioactive and can accumulate in bones  which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous   plutonium was first produced and isolated on december 14  1940 by dr  glenn t  seaborg  joseph w  kennedy  edwin m  mcmillan  and arthur c  wahl by deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 60-inch cyclotron at the university of california  berkeley  they first synthesized neptunium-238  half-life 2.1 days  which subsequently beta-decayed to form a new heavier element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238  half-life 87.7 years   uranium had been named after the planet uranus and neptunium after the planet neptune  and so element 94 was named after pluto  which at the time was considered to be a planet as well  wartime secrecy prevented them from announcing the discovery until 1948  plutonium is the heaviest element to occur in nature as trace quantities arising similarly from the neutron capture of natural uranium-238  plutonium is much more common on earth since 1945 as a product of neutron capture and beta decay  where some of the neutrons released by the fission process convert uranium-238 nuclei into plutonium-239   both plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile  meaning that they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction  leading to applications in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors  plutonium-240 exhibits a high rate of spontaneous fission  raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it  the presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample s usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel  and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its grade  weapons-grade  fuel-grade  or reactor-grade   plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88 years and emits alpha particles  it is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators  which are used to power some spacecraft  plutonium isotopes are expensive and inconvenient to separate  so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors   producing plutonium in useful quantities for the first time was a major part of the manhattan project during world war ii that developed the first atomic bombs  the fat man bombs used in the trinity nuclear test in july 1945  and in the bombing of nagasaki in august 1945  had plutonium cores  human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent  and several criticality accidents  some lethal  occurred after the war  disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the cold war is a nuclear-proliferation and environmental concern  other sources of plutonium in the environment are fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests  now banned       plutonium  like most metals  has a bright silvery appearance at first  much like nickel  but it oxidizes very quickly to a dull gray  although yellow and olive green are also reported  2][3  at room temperature plutonium is in its \u03b1  alpha  form  this  the most common structural form of the element  allotrope   is about as hard and brittle as gray cast iron unless it is alloyed with other metals to make it soft and ductile  unlike most metals  it is not a good conductor of heat or electricity  it has a low melting point (640\xa0\xb0c  and an unusually high boiling point (3,228\xa0\xb0c   2   alpha decay  the release of a high-energy helium nucleus  is the most common form of radioactive decay for plutonium  4  a 5\xa0kg mass of 239pu contains about 7025125000000000000\u266012.5\xd71024 atoms  with a half-life of 24,100 years  about 7013115000000000000\u266011.5\xd71012 of its atoms decay each second by emitting a 5.157\xa0mev alpha particle  this amounts to 9.68 watts of power  heat produced by the deceleration of these alpha particles makes it warm to the touch  5][6   resistivity is a measure of how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current  the resistivity of plutonium at room temperature is very high for a metal  and it gets even higher with lower temperatures  which is unusual for metals  7  this trend continues down to 100\xa0k  below which resistivity rapidly decreases for fresh samples  7  resistivity then begins to increase with time at around 20\xa0k due to radiation damage  with the rate dictated by the isotopic composition of the sample  7   because of self-irradiation  a sample of plutonium fatigues throughout its crystal structure  meaning the ordered arrangement of its atoms becomes disrupted by radiation with time  8  self-irradiation can also lead to annealing which counteracts some of the fatigue effects as temperature increases above 100\xa0k  9   unlike most materials  plutonium increases in density when it melts  by 2.5   but the liquid metal exhibits a linear decrease in density with temperature  7  near the melting point  the liquid plutonium has also very high viscosity and surface tension as compared to other metals  8   plutonium normally has six allotropes and forms a seventh  zeta  \u03b6  at high temperature within a limited pressure range  10  these allotropes  which are different structural modifications or forms of an element  have very similar internal energies but significantly varying densities and crystal structures  this makes plutonium very sensitive to changes in temperature  pressure  or chemistry  and allows for dramatic volume changes following phase transitions from one allotropic form to another  8  the densities of the different allotropes vary from 16.00\xa0g cm3 to 19.86\xa0g cm3.[11   the presence of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult  as it changes state very readily  for example  the \u03b1 form exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium  it has machining characteristics similar to cast iron but changes to the plastic and malleable \u03b2  beta  form at slightly higher temperatures  12  the reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood  the \u03b1 form has a low-symmetry monoclinic structure  hence its brittleness  strength  compressibility  and poor thermal conductivity  10   plutonium in the \u03b4  delta  form normally exists in the 310\xa0\xb0c to 452\xa0\xb0c range but is stable at room temperature when alloyed with a small percentage of gallium  aluminium  or cerium  enhancing workability and allowing it to be welded  12  the \u03b4 form has more typical metallic character  and is roughly as strong and malleable as aluminium  10  in fission weapons  the explosive shock waves used to compress a plutonium core will also cause a transition from the usual \u03b4 phase plutonium to the denser \u03b1 form  significantly helping to achieve supercriticality  13  the \u03b5 phase  the highest temperature solid allotrope  exhibits anomalously high atomic self-diffusion compared to other elements  8   plutonium is a radioactive actinide metal whose isotope  plutonium-239  is one of the three primary fissile isotopes (uranium-233 and uranium-235 are the other two   plutonium-241 is also highly fissile  to be considered fissile  an isotope s atomic nucleus must be able to break apart or fission when struck by a slow moving neutron and to release enough additional neutrons to sustain the nuclear chain reaction by splitting further nuclei  14   pure plutonium-239 may have a multiplication factor  keff  larger than one  which means that if the metal is present in sufficient quantity and with an appropriate geometry  e g   a sphere of sufficient size   it can form a critical mass  15  during fission  a fraction of the nuclear binding energy  which holds a nucleus together  is released as a large amount of electromagnetic and kinetic energy  much of the latter being quickly converted to thermal energy   fission of a kilogram of plutonium-239 can produce an explosion equivalent to 21,000 tons of tnt (88,000\xa0gj   it is this energy that makes plutonium-239 useful in nuclear weapons and reactors  5   the presence of the isotope plutonium-240 in a sample limits its nuclear bomb potential  as plutonium-240 has a relatively high spontaneous fission rate (~440 fissions per second per gram u2014over 1,000 neutrons per second per gram   16  raising the background neutron levels and thus increasing the risk of predetonation  17  plutonium is identified as either weapons-grade  fuel-grade  or reactor-grade based on the percentage of plutonium-240 that it contains  weapons-grade plutonium contains less than 7  plutonium-240  fuel-grade plutonium contains from 7  to less than 19   and power reactor-grade contains 19  or more plutonium-240  supergrade plutonium  with less than 4  of plutonium-240  is used in u s  navy weapons stored in proximity to ship and submarine crews  due to its lower radioactivity  18  the isotope plutonium-238 is not fissile but can undergo nuclear fission easily with fast neutrons as well as alpha decay  5   twenty radioactive isotopes of plutonium have been characterized  the longest-lived are plutonium-244  with a half-life of 80.8\xa0million years  plutonium-242  with a half-life of 373,300\xa0years  and plutonium-239  with a half-life of 24,110\xa0years  all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 7,000\xa0years  this element also has eight metastable states  though all have half-lives less than one second  4   the isotopes of plutonium range in mass number from 228 to 247  the primary decay modes of isotopes with mass numbers lower than the most stable isotope  plutonium-244  are spontaneous fission and alpha emission  mostly forming uranium (92 protons  and neptunium (93 protons  isotopes as decay products  neglecting the wide range of daughter nuclei created by fission processes   the primary decay mode for isotopes with mass numbers higher than plutonium-244 is beta emission  mostly forming americium (95 protons  isotopes as decay products  plutonium-241 is the parent isotope of the neptunium decay series  decaying to americium-241 via beta or electron emission  4][19   plutonium-238 and 239 are the most widely synthesized isotopes  5  plutonium-239 is synthesized via the following reaction using uranium  u  and neutrons  n  via beta decay (\u03b2\u2212  with neptunium  np  as an intermediate  20   neutrons from the fission of uranium-235 are captured by uranium-238 nuclei to form uranium-239  a beta decay converts a neutron into a proton to form np-239  half-life 2.36\xa0days  and another beta decay forms plutonium-239.[21  egon bretscher working on the british tube alloys project predicted this reaction theoretically in 1940.[22   plutonium-238 is synthesized by bombarding uranium-238 with deuterons  d  the nuclei of heavy hydrogen  in the following reaction  23   in this process  a deuteron hitting uranium-238 produces two neutrons and neptunium-238  which spontaneously decays by emitting negative beta particles to form plutonium-238.[24   plutonium isotopes undergo radioactive decay  which produces decay heat  different isotopes produce different amounts of heat per mass  the decay heat is usually listed as watt kilogram  or milliwatt gram  in larger pieces of plutonium  e g  a weapon pit  and inadequate heat removal the resulting self-heating may be significant  all isotopes produce weak gamma radiation on decay   at room temperature  pure plutonium is silvery in color but gains a tarnish when oxidized  26  the element displays four common ionic oxidation states in aqueous solution and one rare one  11   the color shown by plutonium solutions depends on both the oxidation state and the nature of the acid anion  28  it is the acid anion that influences the degree of complexing u2014how atoms connect to a central atom u2014of the plutonium species   metallic plutonium is produced by reacting plutonium tetrafluoride with barium  calcium or lithium at 1200\xa0\xb0c  29  it is attacked by acids  oxygen  and steam but not by alkalis and dissolves easily in concentrated hydrochloric  hydroiodic and perchloric acids  30  molten metal must be kept in a vacuum or an inert atmosphere to avoid reaction with air  12  at 135\xa0\xb0c the metal will ignite in air and will explode if placed in carbon tetrachloride  31   plutonium is a reactive metal  in moist air or moist argon  the metal oxidizes rapidly  producing a mixture of oxides and hydrides  2  if the metal is exposed long enough to a limited amount of water vapor  a powdery surface coating of puo2 is formed  2  also formed is plutonium hydride but an excess of water vapor forms only puo2.[30   plutonium shows enormous  and reversible  reaction rates with pure hydrogen  forming plutonium hydride  8  it also reacts readily with oxygen  forming puo and puo2 as well as intermediate oxides  plutonium oxide fills 40  more volume than plutonium metal  the metal reacts with the halogens  giving rise to compounds with the general formula pux3 where x can be f  cl  br or i and puf4 is also seen  the following oxyhalides are observed  puocl  puobr and puoi  it will react with carbon to form puc  nitrogen to form pun and silicon to form pusi2.[11][31   powders of plutonium  its hydrides and certain oxides like pu2o3 are pyrophoric  meaning they can ignite spontaneously at ambient temperature and are therefore handled in an inert  dry atmosphere of nitrogen or argon  bulk plutonium ignites only when heated above 400\xa0\xb0c  pu2o3 spontaneously heats up and transforms into puo2  which is stable in dry air  but reacts with water vapor when heated  32   crucibles used to contain plutonium need to be able to withstand its strongly reducing properties  refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the more stable oxides  borides  carbides  nitrides and silicides can tolerate this  melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible  12   cerium is used as a chemical simulant of plutonium for development of containment  extraction  and other technologies  33   plutonium is an element in which the 5f electrons are the transition border between delocalized and localized  it is therefore considered one of the most complex elements  34  the anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure  the energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low  the size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice  on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior  the proximity of energy levels leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal energy levels  this leads to competing 5fn7s2 and 5fn u221216d17s2 configurations  which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior  the highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium  8   plutonium can form alloys and intermediate compounds with most other metals  exceptions include lithium  sodium  potassium  rubidium and caesium of the alkali metals  and magnesium  calcium  strontium  and barium of the alkaline earth metals  and europium and ytterbium of the rare earth metals  30  partial exceptions include the refractory metals chromium  molybdenum  niobium  tantalum  and tungsten  which are soluble in liquid plutonium  but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium  30  gallium  aluminium  americium  scandium and cerium can stabilize the \u03b4 phase of plutonium for room temperature  silicon  indium  zinc and zirconium allow formation of metastable \u03b4 state when rapidly cooled  high amounts of hafnium  holmium and thallium also allows some retention of the \u03b4 phase at room temperature  neptunium is the only element that can stabilize the \u03b1 phase at higher temperatures  8   plutonium alloys can be produced by adding a metal to molten plutonium  if the alloying metal is sufficiently reductive  plutonium can be added in the form of oxides or halides  the \u03b4 phase plutonium u2013gallium and plutonium u2013aluminium alloys are produced by adding plutonium iii  fluoride to molten gallium or aluminium  which has the advantage of avoiding dealing directly with the highly reactive plutonium metal  35   trace amounts of plutonium-238 and plutonium-239 can be found in nature  small traces of plutonium-239  a few parts per trillion  and its decay products are naturally found in some concentrated ores of uranium  42  such as the natural nuclear fission reactor in oklo  gabon  43  the ratio of plutonium-239 to uranium at the cigar lake mine uranium deposit ranges from 6988240000000000000\u26602.4\xd710\u221212 to 6989440000000000000\u266044\xd710\u221212.[44  these trace amounts of 239pu originate in the following fashion  on rare occasions  238u undergoes spontaneous fission  and in the process  the nucleus emits one or two free neutrons with some kinetic energy  when one of these neutrons strikes the nucleus of another 238u atom  it is absorbed by the atom  which becomes 239u  with a relatively short half-life  239u decays to 239np  which decays into 239pu  45][46  finally  exceedingly small amounts of plutonium-238  attributed to the extremely rare double beta decay of uranium-238  have been found in natural uranium samples  47   due to its relatively long half-life of about 80\xa0million years  it was suggested that plutonium-244 occurs naturally as a primordial nuclide  but early reports of its detection could not be confirmed  48  however  its long half-life ensured its circulation across the solar system before its extinction  49  and indeed  244pu has not yet been found in matter other than meteorites  50  the former presence of extinct 244pu in the early solar system has been confirmed  since it manifests itself today as an excess of its daughters  either 232th  from the alpha decay pathway  or xenon isotopes  from its spontaneous fission   the latter are generally more useful  because the chemistries of thorium and plutonium are rather similar  both are predominantly tetravalent  and hence an excess of thorium would not be strong evidence that some of it was formed as a plutonium daughter  51   minute traces of plutonium are usually found in the human body due to the 550 atmospheric and underwater nuclear tests that have been carried out  and to a small number of major nuclear accidents  most atmospheric and underwater nuclear testing was stopped by the limited test ban treaty in 1963  which was signed and ratified by the united states  the united kingdom  the soviet union  and other nations  continued atmospheric nuclear weapons testing since 1963 by non-treaty nations included those by china  atomic bomb test above the gobi desert in 1964  hydrogen bomb test in 1967  and follow-on tests   and france  tests as recently as the 1990s   because it is deliberately manufactured for nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors  plutonium-239 is the most abundant isotope of plutonium by far  31   enrico fermi and a team of scientists at the university of rome reported that they had discovered element 94 in 1934.[52  fermi called the element hesperium and mentioned it in his nobel lecture in 1938.[53  the sample was actually a mixture of barium  krypton  and other elements  but this was not known at the time  54  nuclear fission was discovered in germany in 1939 by fritz strassmann and otto hahn  the mechanism of fission was then theoretically explained by lise meitner and otto frisch  55   plutonium  specifically  plutonium-238  was first produced and isolated on december 14  1940  and chemically identified on february 23  1941  by glenn t  seaborg  edwin mcmillan  joseph w  kennedy  and arthur wahl by deuteron bombardment of uranium in the 60-inch (150\xa0cm  cyclotron at the berkeley radiation laboratory at the university of california  berkeley  56][57  in the 1940 experiment  neptunium-238 was created directly by the bombardment but decayed by beta emission with a half-life of a little over two days  which indicated the formation of element 94.[31   a paper documenting the discovery was prepared by the team and sent to the journal physical review in march 1941,[31  but publication was delayed until a year after the end of world war ii due to security concerns  58  at the cavendish laboratory in cambridge  egon bretscher and norman feather realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product  they calculated that element 94 would be fissile  and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium  and could easily be separated from it  22   mcmillan had recently named the first transuranic element neptunium after the planet neptune  and suggested that element 94  being the next element in the series  be named for what was then considered the next planet  pluto  5  note 2  nicholas kemmer of the cambridge team independently proposed the same name  based on the same reasoning as the berkeley team  22  seaborg originally considered the name  plutium   but later thought that it did not sound as good as "plutonium   60  he chose the letters  pu  as a joke  which passed without notice into the periodic table  note 3  alternative names considered by seaborg and others were  ultimium  or  extremium  because of the erroneous belief that they had found the last possible element on the periodic table  62   the chemistry of plutonium was found to resemble uranium after a few months of initial study  31  early research was continued at the secret metallurgical laboratory of the university of chicago  on august 20  1942  a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time  about 50\xa0micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1\xa0microgram was isolated  42][63  this procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element s atomic weight  64  note 4  on december 2  1942  on a racket court under the west grandstand at the university of chicago s stagg field  researchers headed by enrico fermi achieved the first self-sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and uranium pile known as cp-1  using theoretical information garnered from the operation of cp-1  dupont constructed an air-cooled experimental production reactor  known as x-10  and a pilot chemical separation facility at oak ridge  the separation facility  using methods developed by glenn t  seaborg and a team of researchers at the met lab  removed plutonium from uranium irradiated in the x-10 reactor  information from cp-1 was also useful to met lab scientists designing the water-cooled plutonium production reactors for hanford  construction at the site began in mid-1943.[65   in november 1943 some plutonium trifluoride was reduced to create the first sample of plutonium metal  a few micrograms of metallic beads  42  enough plutonium was produced to make it the first synthetically made element to be visible with the unaided eye  66   the nuclear properties of plutonium-239 were also studied  researchers found that when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart  fissions  by releasing more neutrons and energy  these neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction  this can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass  31   during the early stages of research  animals were used to study the effects of radioactive substances on health  these studies began in 1944 at the university of california at berkeley u2019s radiation laboratory and were conducted by joseph g  hamilton  hamilton was looking to answer questions about how plutonium would vary in the body depending on exposure mode  oral ingestion  inhalation  absorption through skin   retention rates  and how plutonium would be fixed in tissues and distributed among the various organs  hamilton started administering soluble microgram portions of plutonium-239 compounds to rats using different valence states and different methods of introducing the plutonium  oral  intravenous  etc    eventually  the lab at chicago also conducted its own plutonium injection experiments using different animals such as mice  rabbits  fish  and even dogs  the results of the studies at berkeley and chicago showed that plutonium s physiological behavior differed significantly from that of radium  the most alarming result was that there was significant deposition of plutonium in the liver and in the  actively metabolizing  portion of bone  furthermore  the rate of plutonium elimination in the excreta differed between species of animals by as much as a factor of five  such variation made it extremely difficult to estimate what the rate would be for human beings  67   during world war ii the u s  government established the manhattan project  which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb  the three primary research and production sites of the project were the plutonium production facility at what is now the hanford site  the uranium enrichment facilities at oak ridge  tennessee  and the weapons research and design laboratory  now known as los alamos national laboratory  68   the first production reactor that made plutonium-239 was the x-10 graphite reactor  it went online in 1943 and was built at a facility in oak ridge that later became the oak ridge national laboratory  31  note 5   in january 1944  workers laid the foundations for the first chemical separation building  t plant located in 200-west  both the t plant and its sister facility in 200-west  the u plant  were completed by october   u plant was used only for training during the manhattan project   the separation building in 200-east  b plant  was completed in february 1945  the second facility planned for 200-east was canceled  nicknamed queen marys by the workers who built them  the separation buildings were awesome canyon-like structures 800 feet long  65 feet wide  and 80 feet high containing forty process pools  the interior had an eerie quality as operators behind seven feet of concrete shielding manipulated remote control equipment by looking through television monitors and periscopes from an upper gallery  even with massive concrete lids on the process pools  precautions against radiation exposure were necessary and influenced all aspects of plant design  65   on april 5  1944  emilio segr xe8 at los alamos received the first sample of reactor-produced plutonium from oak ridge  70  within ten days  he discovered that reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of the isotope plutonium-240 than cyclotron-produced plutonium  plutonium-240 has a high spontaneous fission rate  raising the overall background neutron level of the plutonium sample  71  the original gun-type plutonium weapon  code-named  thin man   had to be abandoned as a result u2014the increased number of spontaneous neutrons meant that nuclear pre-detonation  fizzle  was likely  72   the entire plutonium weapon design effort at los alamos was soon changed to the more complicated implosion device  code-named  fat man   with an implosion weapon  plutonium is compressed to a high density with explosive lenses u2014a technically more daunting task than the simple gun-type design  but necessary to use plutonium for weapons purposes  enriched uranium  by contrast  can be used with either method  72   construction of the hanford b reactor  the first industrial-sized nuclear reactor for the purposes of material production  was completed in march 1945  b reactor produced the fissile material for the plutonium weapons used during world war ii  note 6  b  d and f were the initial reactors built at hanford  and six additional plutonium-producing reactors were built later at the site  75   by the end of january 1945  the highly purified plutonium underwent further concentration in the completed chemical isolation building  where remaining impurities were removed successfully  los alamos received its first plutonium from hanford on february 2  while it was still by no means clear that enough plutonium could be produced for use in bombs by the war s end  hanford was by early 1945 in operation  only two years had passed since col  franklin matthias first set up his temporary headquarters on the banks of the columbia river  65   according to kate brown  the plutonium production plants at hanford and mayak in russia  over a period of four decades   both released more than 200 million curies of radioactive isotopes into the surrounding environment \u2014 twice the amount expelled in the chernobyl disaster in each instance   76  most of this radioactive contamination over the years were part of normal operations  but unforeseen accidents did occur and plant management kept this secret  as the pollution continued unabated  76   in 2004  a safe was discovered during excavations of a burial trench at the hanford nuclear site  inside the safe were various items  including a large glass bottle containing a whitish slurry which was subsequently identified as the oldest sample of weapons-grade plutonium known to exist  isotope analysis by pacific northwest national laboratory indicated that the plutonium in the bottle was manufactured in the x-10 graphite reactor at oak ridge during 1944.[77][78][79   the first atomic bomb test  codenamed  trinity  and detonated on july 16  1945  near alamogordo  new mexico  used plutonium as its fissile material  42  the implosion design of  the gadget   as the trinity device was code-named  used conventional explosive lenses to compress a sphere of plutonium into a supercritical mass  which was simultaneously showered with neutrons from the  urchin   an initiator made of polonium and beryllium  neutron source  (\u03b1  n  reaction   31  together  these ensured a runaway chain reaction and explosion  the overall weapon weighed over 4 tonnes  although it used just 6.2\xa0kg of plutonium in its core  80  about 20  of the plutonium used in the trinity weapon underwent fission  resulting in an explosion with an energy equivalent to approximately 20,000 tons of tnt  81  note 7   an identical design was used in the  fat man  atomic bomb dropped on nagasaki  japan  on august 9  1945  killing 35,000\u201340,000 people  most of whom were industrial workers  and destroying 68%\u201380  of war production at nagasaki  83  only after the announcement of the first atomic bombs was the existence and name of plutonium made known to the public by the manhattan project s smyth report  84   large stockpiles of weapons-grade plutonium were built up by both the soviet union and the united states during the cold war  the u s  reactors at hanford and the savannah river site in south carolina produced 103\xa0tonnes  85  and an estimated 170\xa0tonnes of military-grade plutonium was produced in the ussr  86  note 8  each year about 20\xa0tonnes of the element is still produced as a by-product of the nuclear power industry  11  as much as 1000\xa0tonnes of plutonium may be in storage with more than 200\xa0tonnes of that either inside or extracted from nuclear weapons  31  sipri estimated the world plutonium stockpile in 2007 as about 500 tonnes  divided equally between weapon and civilian stocks  88   radioactive contamination at the rocky flats plant primarily resulted from two major plutonium fires in 1957 and 1969  much lower concentrations of radioactive isotopes were released throughout the operational life of the plant from 1952 to 1992  prevailing winds from the plant carried airborne contamination south and east  into populated areas northwest of denver  the contamination of the denver area by plutonium from the fires and other sources was not publicly reported until the 1970s  according to a 1972 study coauthored by edward martell   in the more densely populated areas of denver  the pu contamination level in surface soils is several times fallout   and the plutonium contamination  just east of the rocky flats plant ranges up to hundreds of times that from nuclear tests   89  as noted by carl johnson in ambio   exposures of a large population in the denver area to plutonium and other radionuclides in the exhaust plumes from the plant date back to 1953."[90  weapons production at the rocky flats plant was halted after a combined fbi and epa raid in 1989 and years of protests  the plant has since been shut down  with its buildings demolished and completely removed from the site  91   in the u s   some plutonium extracted from dismantled nuclear weapons is melted to form glass logs of plutonium oxide that weigh two xa0tonnes  31  the glass is made of borosilicates mixed with cadmium and gadolinium  note 9  these logs are planned to be encased in stainless steel and stored as much as 4\xa0km (2\xa0mi  underground in bore holes that will be back-filled with concrete  31  the u s  planned to store plutonium in this way at the yucca mountain nuclear waste repository  which is about 100 miles (160\xa0km  north-east of las vegas  nevada  92   on march 5  2009  energy secretary steven chu told a senate hearing  the yucca mountain site no longer was viewed as an option for storing reactor waste   93  starting in 1999  military-generated nuclear waste is being entombed at the waste isolation pilot plant in new mexico   in a presidential memorandum dated january 29  2010  president obama established the blue ribbon commission on america s nuclear future  94  in their final report the commission put forth recommendations for developing a comprehensive strategy to pursue  including  95   during and after the end of world war ii  scientists working on the manhattan project and other nuclear weapons research projects conducted studies of the effects of plutonium on laboratory animals and human subjects  96  animal studies found that a few milligrams of plutonium per kilogram of tissue is a lethal dose  97   in the case of human subjects  this involved injecting solutions containing  typically  five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill  or to have a life expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition  96  this was reduced to one microgram in july 1945 after animal studies found that the way plutonium distributed itself in bones was more dangerous than radium  97  most of the subjects  eileen welsome says  were poor  powerless  and sick  98   from 1945 to 1947  eighteen human test subjects were injected with plutonium without informed consent  the tests were used to create diagnostic tools to determine the uptake of plutonium in the body in order to develop safety standards for working with plutonium  96  ebb cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of plutonium on 10 april 1945 at oak ridge  tennessee  99][100  this experiment was under the supervision of harold hodge  101  other experiments directed by the united states atomic energy commission and the manhattan project continued into the 1970s  the plutonium files chronicles the lives of the subjects of the secret program by naming each person involved and discussing the ethical and medical research conducted in secret by the scientists and doctors  the episode is now considered to be a serious breach of medical ethics and of the hippocratic oath  102   the government covered up most of these radiation mishaps until 1993  when president bill clinton ordered a change of policy and federal agencies then made available relevant records  the resulting investigation was undertaken by the president u2019s advisory committee on human radiation experiments  and it uncovered much of the material about plutonium research on humans  the committee issued a controversial 1995 report which said that  wrongs were committed  but it did not condemn those who perpetrated them  98   the isotope plutonium-239 is a key fissile component in nuclear weapons  due to its ease of fission and availability  encasing the bomb s plutonium pit in a tamper  an optional layer of dense material  decreases the amount of plutonium needed to reach critical mass by reflecting escaping neutrons back into the plutonium core  this reduces the amount of plutonium needed to reach criticality from 16\xa0kg to 10\xa0kg  which is a sphere with a diameter of about 10 centimeters (4\xa0in   103  this critical mass is about a third of that for uranium-235.[5   the fat man plutonium bombs used explosive compression of plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal  combined with a central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency  thus only 6.2\xa0kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of tnt  81][104  hypothetically  as little as 4\xa0kg of plutonium u2014and maybe even less u2014could be used to make a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs  104   spent nuclear fuel from normal light water reactors contains plutonium  but it is a mixture of plutonium-242  240  239 and 238  the mixture is not sufficiently enriched for efficient nuclear weapons  but can be used once as mox fuel  105  accidental neutron capture causes the amount of plutonium-242 and 240 to grow each time the plutonium is irradiated in a reactor with low-speed  thermal  neutrons  so that after the second cycle  the plutonium can only be consumed by fast neutron reactors  if fast neutron reactors are not available  the normal case   excess plutonium is usually discarded  and forms the longest-lived component of nuclear waste  the desire to consume this plutonium and other transuranic fuels and reduce the radiotoxicity of the waste is the usual reason nuclear engineers give to make fast neutron reactors  106   the most common chemical process  purex (plutonium u2013uranium extraction  reprocesses spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium and uranium which can be used to form a mixed oxide  mox  fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors  weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix  mox fuel is used in light water reactors and consists of 60\xa0kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel  after four years  three-quarters of the plutonium is burned  turned into other elements   31  breeder reactors are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume  107   mox fuel has been in use since the 1980s  and is widely used in europe  105  in september 2000  the united states and the russian federation signed a plutonium management and disposition agreement by which each agreed to dispose of 34\xa0tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium  108  the u s  department of energy plans to dispose of 34\xa0tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium in the united states before the end of 2019 by converting the plutonium to a mox fuel to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors  108   mox fuel improves total burnup  a fuel rod is reprocessed after three years of use to remove waste products  which by then account for 3  of the total weight of the rods  31  any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those three years are left and the rod goes back into production  note 10  the presence of up to 1  gallium per mass in weapons-grade plutonium alloy has the potential to interfere with long-term operation of a light water reactor  109   plutonium recovered from spent reactor fuel poses little proliferation hazard  because of excessive contamination with non-fissile plutonium-240 and plutonium-242  separation of the isotopes is not feasible  a dedicated reactor operating on very low burnup  hence minimal exposure of newly formed plutonium-239 to additional neutrons which causes it to be transformed to heavier isotopes of plutonium  is generally required to produce material suitable for use in efficient nuclear weapons  while  weapons-grade  plutonium is defined to contain at least 92  plutonium-239  of the total plutonium   the united states have managed to detonate an under-20kt device using plutonium believed to contain only about 85  plutonium-239  so called   fuel-grade  plutonium  110  the  reactor-grade  plutonium produced by a regular lwr burnup cycle typically contains less than 60  pu-239  with up to 30  parasitic pu-240/pu-242  and 10\u201315  fissile pu-241.[110  it is unknown if a device using plutonium obtained from reprocessed civil nuclear waste can be detonated  however such a device could hypothetically fizzle and spread radioactive materials over a large urban area  the iaea conservatively classifies plutonium of all isotopic vectors as  direct-use  material  that is   nuclear material that can be used for the manufacture of nuclear explosives components without transmutation or further enrichment   110   the isotope plutonium-238 has a half-life of 87.74\xa0years  111  it emits a large amount of thermal energy with low levels of both gamma rays photons and spontaneous neutron rays particles  112  being an alpha emitter  it combines high energy radiation with low penetration and thereby requires minimal shielding  a sheet of paper can be used to shield against the alpha particles emitted by plutonium-238  one kilogram of the isotope can generate about 570 watts of heat  5][112   these characteristics make it well-suited for electrical power generation for devices that must function without direct maintenance for timescales approximating a human lifetime  it is therefore used in radioisotope thermoelectric generators and radioisotope heater units such as those in the cassini  113  voyager  galileo and new horizons 114  space probes  and the curiosity mars rover  115   the twin voyager spacecraft were launched in 1977  each containing a 500 watt plutonium power source  over 30 years later  each source is still producing about 300 watts which allows limited operation of each spacecraft  116  an earlier version of the same technology powered five apollo lunar surface experiment packages  starting with apollo 12 in 1969.[31   plutonium-238 has also been used successfully to power artificial heart pacemakers  to reduce the risk of repeated surgery  117][118  it has been largely replaced by lithium-based primary cells  but as of 2003 update  there were somewhere between 50 and 100 plutonium-powered pacemakers still implanted and functioning in living patients  119  plutonium-238 was studied as a way to provide supplemental heat to scuba diving  120  plutonium-238 mixed with beryllium is used to generate neutrons for research purposes  31   there are two aspects to the harmful effects of plutonium  the radioactivity and the heavy metal poison effects  isotopes and compounds of plutonium are radioactive and accumulate in bone marrow  contamination by plutonium oxide has resulted from nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents  including military nuclear accidents where nuclear weapons have burned  121  studies of the effects of these smaller releases  as well as of the widespread radiation poisoning sickness and death following the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki  have provided considerable information regarding the dangers  symptoms and prognosis of radiation poisoning  which in the case of the japanese hibakusha survivors was largely unrelated to direct plutonium exposure  122   during the decay of plutonium  three types of radiation are released u2014alpha  beta  and gamma  alpha  beta  and gamma radiation are all forms of ionizing radiation  either acute or longer-term exposure carries a danger of serious health outcomes including radiation sickness  genetic damage  cancer  and death  the danger increases with the amount of exposure  31  alpha radiation can travel only a short distance and cannot travel through the outer  dead layer of human skin  beta radiation can penetrate human skin  but cannot go all the way through the body  gamma radiation can go all the way through the body  123  even though alpha radiation cannot penetrate the skin  ingested or inhaled plutonium does irradiate internal organs  31  the skeleton  where plutonium accumulates  and the liver  where it collects and becomes concentrated  are at risk  30  plutonium is not absorbed into the body efficiently when ingested  only 0.04  of plutonium oxide is absorbed after ingestion  31  plutonium absorbed by the body is excreted very slowly  with a biological half-life of 200 years  124  plutonium passes only slowly through cell membranes and intestinal boundaries  so absorption by ingestion and incorporation into bone structure proceeds very slowly  125][126   plutonium is more dangerous when inhaled than when ingested  the risk of lung cancer increases once the total radiation dose equivalent of inhaled plutonium exceeds 400 msv  127  the u s  department of energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling 5,000 plutonium particles  each about 3\xa0\xb5m wide  to be 1  over the background u s  average  128  ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death  however no human being is known to have died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium  and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies  110   the  hot particle  theory in which a particle of plutonium dust irradiates a localized spot of lung tissue is not supported by mainstream research u2014such particles are more mobile than originally thought and toxicity is not measurably increased due to particulate form  125  when inhaled  plutonium can pass into the bloodstream  once in the bloodstream  plutonium moves throughout the body and into the bones  liver  or other body organs  plutonium that reaches body organs generally stays in the body for decades and continues to expose the surrounding tissue to radiation and thus may cause cancer  129   a commonly cited quote by ralph nader states that a pound of plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere would be enough to kill 8 billion people  130  however  calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation  this makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas  131  nader s views were challenged in 1976 by bernard cohen  as described in the book nuclear power  both sides  the best arguments for and against the most controversial technology  cohen s own estimate is that a dose of 200\xa0micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer  132   several populations of people who have been exposed to plutonium dust  e g  people living down-wind of nevada test sites  nagasaki survivors  nuclear facility workers  and  terminally ill  patients injected with pu in 1945\u201346 to study pu metabolism  have been carefully followed and analyzed  these studies generally do not show especially high plutonium toxicity or plutonium-induced cancer results  such as albert stevens who survived into old age after being injected with plutonium  125   there were about 25 workers from los alamos national laboratory who inhaled a considerable amount of plutonium dust during 1940s  according to the hot-particle theory  each of them has a 99.5  chance of being dead from lung cancer by now  but there has not been a single lung cancer among them   131][133   plutonium has a metallic taste  134   care must be taken to avoid the accumulation of amounts of plutonium which approach critical mass  particularly because plutonium s critical mass is only a third of that of uranium-235.[5  a critical mass of plutonium emits lethal amounts of neutrons and gamma rays  135  plutonium in solution is more likely to form a critical mass than the solid form due to moderation by the hydrogen in water  11   criticality accidents have occurred in the past  some of them with lethal consequences  careless handling of tungsten carbide bricks around a 6.2\xa0kg plutonium sphere resulted in a fatal dose of radiation at los alamos on august 21  1945  when scientist harry daghlian received a dose estimated to be 5.1\xa0sievert (510\xa0rems  and died 25\xa0days later  136][137  nine months later  another los alamos scientist  louis slotin  died from a similar accident involving a beryllium reflector and the same plutonium core  the so-called  demon core   that had previously claimed the life of daghlian  138   in december 1958  during a process of purifying plutonium at los alamos  a critical mass was formed in a mixing vessel  which resulted in the death of a chemical operator named cecil kelley  other nuclear accidents have occurred in the soviet union  japan  the united states  and many other countries  139   metallic plutonium is a fire hazard  especially if the material is finely divided  in a moist environment  plutonium forms hydrides on its surface  which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature  plutonium expands up to 70  in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container  32  the radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard  magnesium oxide sand is probably the most effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire  it cools the burning material  acting as a heat sink  and also blocks off oxygen  special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form  generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required  32  note 11   around 11 metric tons of plutonium may be possessed by japan alone  with 36 tons pending return after reprocessing in britain and france  this is probably enough to make 6,000 atomic bombs  141   the usual transportation of plutonium is through the more stable plutonium oxide in a sealed package  a typical transport consists of one truck carrying one protected shipping container  holding a number of packages with a total weight varying from 80 to 200\xa0kg of plutonium oxide  a sea shipment may consist of several containers  each of them holding a sealed package  142  the united states nuclear regulatory commission dictates that it must be solid instead of powder if the contents surpass 0.74\xa0tbq (20\xa0curie  of radioactive activity  143  in a recent example  the pacific egret 144  and pacific heron of pacific nuclear transport ltd  are taking 331\xa0kg (730\xa0lbs  of plutonium to a united states government facility in savannah river  south carolina  145][146   the u s  government air transport regulations permit the transport of plutonium by air  subject to restrictions on other dangerous materials carried on the same flight  packaging requirements  and stowage in the rearmost part of the aircraft  147   in 2012 media revealed that plutonium has been flown out of norway on commercial passenger airlines u2014around every other year u2014including one time in 2011.[148  regulations permit an airplane to transport 15 grams of fissionable material  148  such plutonium transportation is without problems  according to a senior advisor (seniorr xe5dgiver  at statens str xe5levern  148
