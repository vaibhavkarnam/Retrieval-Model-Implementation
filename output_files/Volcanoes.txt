Volcanoes
 a volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object  such as earth  that allows hot lava  volcanic ash  and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface   earth s volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major  rigid tectonic plates that float on a hotter  softer layer in its mantle  1  therefore  on earth  volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging  for example  a mid-oceanic ridge  such as the mid-atlantic ridge  has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart  the pacific ring of fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together  volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust s interior plates clarify   e g   in the east african rift and the wells gray-clearwater volcanic field and rio grande rift in north america  this type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of  plate hypothesis  volcanism  2  volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as mantle plumes  these so-called  hotspots   for example hawaii  are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core u2013mantle boundary  3,000\xa0km deep in the earth  volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another   erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards  not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption  one such hazard is that volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft  in particular those with jet engines where ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature  the melted particles then adhere to the turbine blades and alter their shape  disrupting the operation of the turbine  large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the earth s lower atmosphere  or troposphere   however  they also absorb heat radiated up from the earth  thereby warming the upper atmosphere  or stratosphere   historically  so-called volcanic winters have caused catastrophic famines       the word volcano is derived from the name of vulcano  a volcanic island in the aeolian islands of italy whose name in turn comes from vulcan  the god of fire in roman mythology  3  the study of volcanoes is called volcanology  sometimes spelled vulcanology   at the mid-oceanic ridges  two tectonic plates diverge from one another as new oceanic crust is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock  because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates  the release of pressure leads to adiabatic expansion and the partial melting of the mantle  causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust  most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans  therefore  most volcanic activity is submarine  forming new seafloor  black smokers  also known as deep sea vents  are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity  where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level  volcanic islands are formed  for example  iceland   subduction zones are places where two plates  usually an oceanic plate and a continental plate  collide  in this case  the oceanic plate subducts  or submerges under the continental plate forming a deep ocean trench just offshore  in a process called flux melting  water released from the subducting plate lowers the melting temperature of the overlying mantle wedge  creating magma  this magma tends to be very viscous due to its high silica content  so it often does not reach the surface but cools at depth  when it does reach the surface  a volcano is formed  typical examples of this kind of volcano are mount etna and the volcanoes in the pacific ring of fire    hotspots  is the name given to volcanic areas believed to be formed by mantle plumes  which are hypothesized to be columns of hot material rising from the core-mantle boundary in a fixed space that causes large-volume melting  because tectonic plates move across them  each volcano becomes dormant and is eventually re-formed as the plate advances over the postulated plume  the hawaiian islands have been suggested to have been formed in such a manner  as well as the snake river plain  with the yellowstone caldera being the part of the north american plate currently above the hot spot  this theory is currently under criticism  however  2   the most common perception of a volcano is of a conical mountain  spewing lava and poisonous gases from a crater at its summit  however  this describes just one of the many types of volcano  the features of volcanoes are much more complicated and their structure and behavior depends on a number of factors  some volcanoes have rugged peaks formed by lava domes rather than a summit crater while others have landscape features such as massive plateaus  vents that issue volcanic material  including lava and ash  and gases  mainly steam and magmatic gases  can develop anywhere on the landform and may give rise to smaller cones such as pu u02bbu \u02bb u014c u02bb u014d on a flank of hawaii s k u012blauea  other types of volcano include cryovolcanoes  or ice volcanoes   particularly on some moons of jupiter  saturn  and neptune  and mud volcanoes  which are formations often not associated with known magmatic activity  active mud volcanoes tend to involve temperatures much lower than those of igneous volcanoes except when the mud volcano is actually a vent of an igneous volcano   volcanic fissure vents are flat  linear fractures through which lava emerges   shield volcanoes  so named for their broad  shield-like profiles  are formed by the eruption of low-viscosity lava that can flow a great distance from a vent  they generally do not explode catastrophically  since low-viscosity magma is typically low in silica  shield volcanoes are more common in oceanic than continental settings  the hawaiian volcanic chain is a series of shield cones  and they are common in iceland  as well   lava domes are built by slow eruptions of highly viscous lava  they are sometimes formed within the crater of a previous volcanic eruption  as in the case of mount saint helens  but can also form independently  as in the case of lassen peak  like stratovolcanoes  they can produce violent  explosive eruptions  but their lava generally does not flow far from the originating vent   cryptodomes are formed when viscous lava is forced upward causing the surface to bulge  the 1980 eruption of mount st  helens was an example  lava beneath the surface of the mountain created an upward bulge which slid down the north side of the mountain   volcanic cones or cinder cones result from eruptions of mostly small pieces of scoria and pyroclastics  both resemble cinders  hence the name of this volcano type  that build up around the vent  these can be relatively short-lived eruptions that produce a cone-shaped hill perhaps 30 to 400 meters high  most cinder cones erupt only once  cinder cones may form as flank vents on larger volcanoes  or occur on their own  par xedcutin in mexico and sunset crater in arizona are examples of cinder cones  in new mexico  caja del rio is a volcanic field of over 60 cinder cones   based on satellite images it was suggested that cinder cones might occur on other terrestrial bodies in the solar system too  on the surface of mars and the moon  4][5][6][7   stratovolcanoes or composite volcanoes are tall conical mountains composed of lava flows and other ejecta in alternate layers  the strata that gives rise to the name  stratovolcanoes are also known as composite volcanoes because they are created from multiple structures during different kinds of eruptions  strato composite volcanoes are made of cinders  ash  and lava  cinders and ash pile on top of each other  lava flows on top of the ash  where it cools and hardens  and then the process repeats  classic examples include mount fuji in japan  mayon volcano in the philippines  and mount vesuvius and stromboli in italy   throughout recorded history  ash produced by the explosive eruption of stratovolcanoes has posed the greatest volcanic hazard to civilizations  not only do stratovolcanoes have greater pressure build up from the underlying lava flow than shield volcanoes  but their fissure vents and monogenetic volcanic fields  volcanic cones  have more powerful eruptions  as they are many times under extension  they are also steeper than shield volcanoes  with slopes of 30\u201335\xb0 compared to slopes of generally 5\u201310\xb0  and their loose tephra are material for dangerous lahars  8  large pieces of tephra are called volcanic bombs  big bombs can measure more than 4 feet 1.2 meters  across and weigh several tons  9   a supervolcano usually has a large caldera and can produce devastation on an enormous  sometimes continental  scale  such volcanoes are able to severely cool global temperatures for many years after the eruption due to the huge volumes of sulfur and ash released into the atmosphere  they are the most dangerous type of volcano  examples include  yellowstone caldera in yellowstone national park and valles caldera in new mexico  both western united states   lake taupo in new zealand  lake toba in sumatra  indonesia  and ngorongoro crater in tanzania  because of the enormous area they may cover  supervolcanoes are hard to identify centuries after an eruption  similarly  large igneous provinces are also considered supervolcanoes because of the vast amount of basalt lava erupted  even though the lava flow is non-explosive    submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor  in shallow water  active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean s surface  in the ocean s deep  the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases  however  they can be detected by hydrophones and discoloration of water because of volcanic gases  pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water  even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water  as compared to air  which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor  hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes  and some support peculiar ecosystems based on dissolved minerals  over time  the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts   subglacial volcanoes develop underneath icecaps  they are made up of flat lava which flows at the top of extensive pillow lavas and palagonite  when the icecap melts  the lava on top collapses  leaving a flat-topped mountain  these volcanoes are also called table mountains  tuyas  or  uncommonly  mobergs  very good examples of this type of volcano can be seen in iceland  however  there are also tuyas in british columbia  the origin of the term comes from tuya butte  which is one of the several tuyas in the area of the tuya river and tuya range in northern british columbia  tuya butte was the first such landform analyzed and so its name has entered the geological literature for this kind of volcanic formation  the tuya mountains provincial park was recently established to protect this unusual landscape  which lies north of tuya lake and south of the jennings river near the boundary with the yukon territory   mud volcanoes or mud domes are formations created by geo-excreted liquids and gases  although there are several processes which may cause such activity  the largest structures are 10 kilometers in diameter and reach 700 meters high   another way of classifying volcanoes is by the composition of material erupted  lava   since this affects the shape of the volcano  lava can be broadly classified into four different compositions  cas  amp  wright  1987    two types of lava are named according to the surface texture  \u02bba u02bba  pronounced [\u02c8\u0294a u0294a   and p u0101hoehoe ([pa u02d0\u02c8ho e u02c8ho e    both hawaiian words  \u02bba u02bba is characterized by a rough  clinkery surface and is the typical texture of viscous lava flows  however  even basaltic or mafic flows can be erupted as \u02bba u02bba flows  particularly if the eruption rate is high and the slope is steep   p u0101hoehoe is characterized by its smooth and often ropey or wrinkly surface and is generally formed from more fluid lava flows  usually  only mafic flows will erupt as p u0101hoehoe  since they often erupt at higher temperatures or have the proper chemical make-up to allow them to flow with greater fluidity   a popular way of classifying magmatic volcanoes is by their frequency of eruption according to whom    with those that erupt regularly called active  those that have erupted in historical times but are now quiet called dormant or inactive  and those that have not erupted in historical times called extinct  however  these popular classifications u2014extinct in particular u2014are practically meaningless to scientists  they use classifications which refer to a particular volcano s formative and eruptive processes and resulting shapes  which was explained above   there is no consensus among volcanologists on how to define an  active  volcano  the lifespan of a volcano can vary from months to several million years  making such a distinction sometimes meaningless when compared to the lifespans of humans or even civilizations  for example  many of earth s volcanoes have erupted dozens of times in the past few thousand years but are not currently showing signs of eruption  given the long lifespan of such volcanoes  they are very active  by human lifespans  however  they are not   scientists usually consider a volcano to be erupting or likely to erupt if it is currently erupting  or showing signs of unrest such as unusual earthquake activity or significant new gas emissions  most scientists consider a volcano active if it has erupted in the last 10,000 years  holocene times  \u2013 the smithsonian global volcanism program uses this definition of active  most volcanoes are situated on the pacific ring of fire  10  an estimated 500 million people live near active volcanoes  10   historical time  or recorded history  is another timeframe for active  11][12  the catalogue of the active volcanoes of the world  published by the international association of volcanology  uses this definition  by which there are more than 500 active volcanoes  11  however  the span of recorded history differs from region to region  in china and the mediterranean  it reaches back nearly 3,000 years  but in the pacific northwest of the united states and canada  it reaches back less than 300 years  and in hawaii and new zealand  only around 200 years  11   as of 2013  the following are considered earth s most active volcanoes  13   the longest currently ongoing  but not necessarily continuous  volcanic eruptive phases are  14   other very active volcanoes include   extinct volcanoes are those that scientists consider unlikely to erupt again because the volcano no longer has a magma supply  examples of extinct volcanoes are many volcanoes on the hawaiian \u2013 emperor seamount chain in the pacific ocean  hohentwiel  shiprock and the zuidwal volcano in the netherlands  edinburgh castle in scotland is famously located atop an extinct volcano  otherwise  whether a volcano is truly extinct is often difficult to determine  since  supervolcano  calderas can have eruptive lifespans sometimes measured in millions of years  a caldera that has not produced an eruption in tens of thousands of years is likely to be considered dormant instead of extinct  some volcanologists refer to extinct volcanoes as inactive  though the term is now more commonly used for dormant volcanoes once thought to be extinct   it is difficult to distinguish an extinct volcano from a dormant  inactive  one  volcanoes are often considered to be extinct if there are no written records of its activity  nevertheless  volcanoes may remain dormant for a long period of time  for example  yellowstone has a repose recharge period of around 700,000 years  and toba of around 380,000 years  15  vesuvius was described by roman writers as having been covered with gardens and vineyards before its eruption of 79 ce  which destroyed the towns of herculaneum and pompeii  before its catastrophic eruption of 1991  pinatubo was an inconspicuous volcano  unknown to most people in the surrounding areas  two other examples are the long-dormant soufri xe8re hills volcano on the island of montserrat  thought to be extinct before activity resumed in 1995 and fourpeaked mountain in alaska  which  before its september 2006 eruption  had not erupted since before 8000 bce and had long been thought to be extinct  climate change can reportedly trigger volcanic activity in sensitive areas by changing pressure of ice or seawater and extreme weather  16   the three common popular classifications of volcanoes can be subjective and some volcanoes thought to have been extinct have erupted again  to help prevent people from falsely believing they are not at risk when living on or near a volcano  countries have adopted new classifications to describe the various levels and stages of volcanic activity  17  some alert systems use different numbers or colors to designate the different stages  other systems use colors and words  some systems use a combination of both   the united states geological survey  usgs  has adopted a common system nationwide for characterizing the level of unrest and eruptive activity at volcanoes  the new volcano alert-level system classifies volcanoes now as being in a normal  advisory  watch or warning stage  additionally  colors are used to denote the amount of ash produced  details of the u s  system can be found at volcano warning schemes of the united states   the decade volcanoes are 17 volcanoes identified by the international association of volcanology and chemistry of the earth s interior  iavcei  as being worthy of particular study in light of their history of large  destructive eruptions and proximity to populated areas  they are named decade volcanoes because the project was initiated as part of the united nations-sponsored international decade for natural disaster reduction  the 17 current decade volcanoes are  the deep earth carbon degassing project  an initiative of the deep carbon observatory  monitors nine volcanoes  two of which are decade volcanoes  the focus of the deep earth carbon degassing project is to use multi-component gas analyzer system instruments to measure co2/so2 ratios in real-time and in high-resolution to allow detection of the pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas  improving prediction of volcanic activity  18   there are many different types of volcanic eruptions and associated activity  phreatic eruptions  steam-generated eruptions   explosive eruption of high-silica lava  e g   rhyolite   effusive eruption of low-silica lava  e g   basalt   pyroclastic flows  lahars  debris flow  and carbon dioxide emission  all of these activities can pose a hazard to humans  earthquakes  hot springs  fumaroles  mud pots and geysers often accompany volcanic activity   the concentrations of different volcanic gases can vary considerably from one volcano to the next  water vapor is typically the most abundant volcanic gas  followed by carbon dioxide 19  and sulfur dioxide  other principal volcanic gases include hydrogen sulfide  hydrogen chloride  and hydrogen fluoride  a large number of minor and trace gases are also found in volcanic emissions  for example hydrogen  carbon monoxide  halocarbons  organic compounds  and volatile metal chlorides   large  explosive volcanic eruptions inject water vapor (h2o   carbon dioxide (co2   sulfur dioxide (so2   hydrogen chloride  hcl   hydrogen fluoride  hf  and ash  pulverized rock and pumice  into the stratosphere to heights of 16\u201332 kilometres (10\u201320\xa0mi  above the earth s surface  the most significant impacts from these injections come from the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid (h2so4   which condenses rapidly in the stratosphere to form fine sulfate aerosols  the so2 emissions alone of two different eruptions are sufficient to compare their potential climatic impact  20  the aerosols increase the earth s albedo u2014its reflection of radiation from the sun back into space u2014and thus cool the earth s lower atmosphere or troposphere  however  they also absorb heat radiated up from the earth  thereby warming the stratosphere  several eruptions during the past century have caused a decline in the average temperature at the earth s surface of up to half a degree  fahrenheit scale  for periods of one to three years  sulfur dioxide from the eruption of huaynaputina probably caused the russian famine of 1601\u20131603.[21   one proposed volcanic winter happened c  xa070,000 years ago following the supereruption of lake toba on sumatra island in indonesia  22  according to the toba catastrophe theory to which some anthropologists and archeologists subscribe  it had global consequences  23  killing most humans then alive and creating a population bottleneck that affected the genetic inheritance of all humans today  24  the 1815 eruption of mount tambora created global climate anomalies that became known as the  year without a summer  because of the effect on north american and european weather  25  agricultural crops failed and livestock died in much of the northern hemisphere  resulting in one of the worst famines of the 19th century  26  the freezing winter of 1740\u201341  which led to widespread famine in northern europe  may also owe its origins to a volcanic eruption  27   it has been suggested that volcanic activity caused or contributed to the end-ordovician  permian-triassic  late devonian mass extinctions  and possibly others  the massive eruptive event which formed the siberian traps  one of the largest known volcanic events of the last 500\xa0million years of earth s geological history  continued for a million years and is considered to be the likely cause of the  great dying  about 250 million years ago  28  which is estimated to have killed 90  of species existing at the time  29   sulfate aerosols promote complex chemical reactions on their surfaces that alter chlorine and nitrogen chemical species in the stratosphere  this effect  together with increased stratospheric chlorine levels from chlorofluorocarbon pollution  generates chlorine monoxide  clo   which destroys ozone (o3   as the aerosols grow and coagulate  they settle down into the upper troposphere where they serve as nuclei for cirrus clouds and further modify the earth s radiation balance  most of the hydrogen chloride  hcl  and hydrogen fluoride  hf  are dissolved in water droplets in the eruption cloud and quickly fall to the ground as acid rain  the injected ash also falls rapidly from the stratosphere  most of it is removed within several days to a few weeks  finally  explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of carbon for biogeochemical cycles  30   gas emissions from volcanoes are a natural contributor to acid rain  volcanic activity releases about 130 to 230 teragrams (145 million to 255 million short tons  of carbon dioxide each year  31  volcanic eruptions may inject aerosols into the earth s atmosphere  large injections may cause visual effects such as unusually colorful sunsets and affect global climate mainly by cooling it  volcanic eruptions also provide the benefit of adding nutrients to soil through the weathering process of volcanic rocks  these fertile soils assist the growth of plants and various crops  volcanic eruptions can also create new islands  as the magma cools and solidifies upon contact with the water   ash thrown into the air by eruptions can present a hazard to aircraft  especially jet aircraft where the particles can be melted by the high operating temperature  the melted particles then adhere to the turbine blades and alter their shape  disrupting the operation of the turbine  dangerous encounters in 1982 after the eruption of galunggung in indonesia  and 1989 after the eruption of mount redoubt in alaska raised awareness of this phenomenon  nine volcanic ash advisory centers were established by the international civil aviation organization to monitor ash clouds and advise pilots accordingly  the 2010 eruptions of eyjafjallaj xf6kull caused major disruptions to air travel in europe   the earth s moon has no large volcanoes and no current volcanic activity  although recent evidence suggests it may still possess a partially molten core  32  however  the moon does have many volcanic features such as maria  the darker patches seen on the moon   rilles and domes   the planet venus has a surface that is 90  basalt  indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface  the planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago  33  from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface  lava flows are widespread and forms of volcanism not present on earth occur as well  changes in the planet s atmosphere and observations of lightning have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions  although there is no confirmation of whether or not venus is still volcanically active  however  radar sounding by the magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at venus s highest volcano maat mons  in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank   there are several extinct volcanoes on mars  four of which are vast shield volcanoes far bigger than any on earth  they include arsia mons  ascraeus mons  hecates tholus  olympus mons  and pavonis mons  these volcanoes have been extinct for many millions of years  34  but the european mars express spacecraft has found evidence that volcanic activity may have occurred on mars in the recent past as well  34   jupiter s moon io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system because of tidal interaction with jupiter  it is covered with volcanoes that erupt sulfur  sulfur dioxide and silicate rock  and as a result  io is constantly being resurfaced  its lavas are the hottest known anywhere in the solar system  with temperatures exceeding 1,800 k (1,500\xa0\xb0c   in february 2001  the largest recorded volcanic eruptions in the solar system occurred on io  35  europa  the smallest of jupiter s galilean moons  also appears to have an active volcanic system  except that its volcanic activity is entirely in the form of water  which freezes into ice on the frigid surface  this process is known as cryovolcanism  and is apparently most common on the moons of the outer planets of the solar system   in 1989 the voyager 2 spacecraft observed cryovolcanoes  ice volcanoes  on triton  a moon of neptune  and in 2005 the cassini u2013huygens probe photographed fountains of frozen particles erupting from enceladus  a moon of saturn  36][37  the ejecta may be composed of water  liquid nitrogen  ammonia  dust  or methane compounds  cassini u2013huygens also found evidence of a methane-spewing cryovolcano on the saturnian moon titan  which is believed to be a significant source of the methane found in its atmosphere  38  it is theorized that cryovolcanism may also be present on the kuiper belt object quaoar   a 2010 study of the exoplanet corot-7b  which was detected by transit in 2009  suggested that tidal heating from the host star very close to the planet and neighboring planets could generate intense volcanic activity similar to that found on io  39   many ancient accounts ascribe volcanic eruptions to supernatural causes  such as the actions of gods or demigods  to the ancient greeks  volcanoes  capricious power could only be explained as acts of the gods  while 16th 17th-century german astronomer johannes kepler believed they were ducts for the earth s tears  40  one early idea counter to this was proposed by jesuit athanasius kircher (1602\u20131680   who witnessed eruptions of mount etna and stromboli  then visited the crater of vesuvius and published his view of an earth with a central fire connected to numerous others caused by the burning of sulfur  bitumen and coal   various explanations were proposed for volcano behavior before the modern understanding of the earth s mantle structure as a semisolid material was developed  for decades after awareness that compression and radioactive materials may be heat sources  their contributions were specifically discounted  volcanic action was often attributed to chemical reactions and a thin layer of molten rock near the surface
