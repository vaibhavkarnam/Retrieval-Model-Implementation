Pumpedstoragehydroelectricity
 pumped-storage hydroelectricity  psh   or pumped hydroelectric energy storage  phes   is a type of hydroelectric energy storage used by electric power systems for load balancing  the method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water  pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation  low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to run the pumps  during periods of high electrical demand  the stored water is released through turbines to produce electric power  although the losses of the pumping process makes the plant a net consumer of energy overall  the system increases revenue by selling more electricity during periods of peak demand  when electricity prices are highest  pumped-storage hydroelectricity allows energy from intermittent sources  such as solar  wind  and other renewables  or excess electricity from continuous base-load sources  such as coal or nuclear  to be saved for periods of higher demand  1][2  the reservoirs used with pumped storage are quite small when compared to conventional hydroelectric dams of similar power capacity  and generating periods are often less than half a day   pumped storage is the largest-capacity form of grid energy storage available  and  as of 2017  the doe global energy storage database reports that psh accounts for over 96  of all active tracked storage installations worldwide  with a total installed nameplate capacity of over 168 gw  3  the round-trip energy efficiency of psh varies between 70%\u201380%,[4][5][6][7  with some sources claiming up to 87%.[8  the main disadvantage of phs is the specialist nature of the site required  needing both geographical height and water availability  suitable sites are therefore likely to be in hilly or mountainous regions  and potentially in areas of outstanding natural beauty  and therefore there are also social and ecological issues to overcome  9       at times of low electrical demand  excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the upper reservoir  when there is higher demand  water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine  generating electricity  reversible turbine generator assemblies act as a combined pump and turbine generator unit  usually a francis turbine design   in open-loop systems  pure pumped-storage plants store water in an upper reservoir with no natural inflows  while pump-back plants utilize a combination of pumped storage and conventional hydroelectric plants with an upper reservoir that is replenished in part by natural inflows from a stream or river  plants that do not use pumped-storage are referred to as conventional hydroelectric plants  conventional hydroelectric plants that have significant storage capacity may be able to play a similar role in the electrical grid as pumped storage by deferring output until needed   taking into account evaporation losses from the exposed water surface and conversion losses  energy recovery of 70-80  or more can be regained  10  this technique is currently the most cost-effective means of storing large amounts of electrical energy  but capital costs and the presence of appropriate geography are critical decision factors in selecting pumped-storage plant sites   the relatively low energy density of pumped storage systems requires either large flows and or large differences in height between reservoirs  the only way to store a significant amount of energy is by having a large body of water located relatively near  but as high above as possible  a second body of water  in some places this occurs naturally  in others one or both bodies of water were man-made  projects in which both reservoirs are artificial and in which no natural inflows are involved with either reservoir are referred to as  closed loop  systems  11   these systems may be economical because they flatten out load variations on the power grid  permitting thermal power stations such as coal-fired plants and nuclear power plants that provide base-load electricity to continue operating at peak efficiency  while reducing the need for  peaking  power plants that use the same fuels as many base-load thermal plants  gas and oil  but have been designed for flexibility rather than maximal efficiency  hence pumped storage systems are crucial when coordinating large groups of heterogeneous generators  however  capital costs for pumped-storage plants are relatively high   along with energy management  pumped storage systems help control electrical network frequency and provide reserve generation  thermal plants are much less able to respond to sudden changes in electrical demand  potentially causing frequency and voltage instability  pumped storage plants  like other hydroelectric plants  can respond to load changes within seconds   the most important use for pumped storage has traditionally been to balance baseload powerplants  but may also be used to abate the fluctuating output of intermittent energy sources  pumped storage provides a load at times of high electricity output and low electricity demand  enabling additional system peak capacity  in certain jurisdictions  electricity prices may be close to zero or occasionally negative on occasions that there is more electrical generation available than there is load available to absorb it  although at present this is rarely due to wind or solar power alone  increased wind and solar generation will increase the likelihood of such occurrences  it is particularly likely that pumped storage will become especially important as a balance for very large scale photovoltaic generation  12  increased long distance transmission capacity combined with significant amounts of energy storage will be a crucial part of regulating any large-scale deployment of intermittent renewable power sources  13  the high non-firm renewable electricity penetration in some regions supplies 40  of annual output  but 60  may be reached before additional storage is necessary  14][15][16   there are small-scale installations of such technology  namely in buildings  although these are economically unfeasible given the economies of scale present  17  also  a large volume of water is required for a meaningful storage capacity which is a difficult fit for an urban setting  17  nevertheless  some authors defend its technological simplicity and secure provision of water as important externalities  17   the first use of pumped storage was in the 1890s in italy and switzerland  in the 1930s reversible hydroelectric turbines became available  these turbines could operate as both turbine-generators and in reverse as electric motor driven pumps  the latest in large-scale engineering technology are variable speed machines for greater efficiency  these machines operate in synchronization with the network frequency when generating  but operate asynchronously  independent of the network frequency  when pumping   the first use of pumped-storage in the united states was in 1930 by the connecticut electric and power company  using a large reservoir located near new milford  connecticut  pumping water from the housatonic river to the storage reservoir 230 feet above  18   in 2009  world pumped storage generating capacity was 104 gw  19  while other sources claim 127 gw  which comprises the vast majority of all types of utility grade electric storage  20  the eu had 38.3 gw net capacity (36.8  of world capacity  out of a total of 140 gw of hydropower and representing 5  of total net electrical capacity in the eu  japan had 25.5 gw net capacity (24.5  of world capacity   19   in 2010 the united states had 21.5 gw of pumped storage generating capacity (20.6  of world capacity   21  phs generated  net  -5.501 gwh of energy in 2010 in the us 22  because more energy is consumed in pumping than is generated  nameplate pumped storage capacity had grown to 21.6 gw by 2014  with pumped storage comprising 97  of grid-scale energy storage in the us  as of late 2014  there were 51 active project proposals with a total of 39 gw of new nameplate capacity across all stages of the ferc licensing process for new pumped storage hydroelectric plants in the us  but no new plants were currently under construction in the us at the time  23][24   the five largest operational pumped-storage plants are listed below  for a detailed list see list of pumped-storage hydroelectric power stations    conventional hydroelectric dams may also make use of pumped storage in a hybrid system that both generates power from water naturally flowing into the reservoir as well as storing water pumped back to the reservoir from below the dam  the grand coulee dam in the us was expanded with a pump-back system in 1973.[35  existing dams may be repowered with reversing turbines thereby extending the length of time the plant can operate at capacity  optionally a pump back powerhouse such as the russell dam 1992  may be added to a dam for increased generating capacity  making use of an existing dams upper reservoir and transmission system can expedite projects and reduce costs   pumped storage plants can operate on seawater  although there are additional challenges involved compared to operation with fresh water  in 1999  the 30 mw yanbaru project in okinawa was the first demonstration of seawater pumped storage  a 300 mw seawater-based project has recently been proposed on lanai  hawaii  and several seawater-based projects have been proposed in ireland and chile  citation needed   a new concept is to use wind turbines or solar power to drive water pumps directly  this could provide a more efficient process and usefully smooth out the variability of energy captured from the wind or sun  36][37][38  in northern chile  the espejo de tarapac xe1 project is a power project of valhalla  that combines solar and hydroelectric resources  the project takes advantage of the unique geographic characteristics of the atacama desert in order to build a 300 mw pumped storage hydroelectric plant that uses the pacific ocean as its lower reservoir and an existing natural concavity as its upper reservoir  and a 600 mw-ac solar photovoltaic plant that is located in the region with the highest solar irradiation in the world  the above characteristics minimize the environmental impact and the cost of the plant  which is usd 400 mm for the pumped storage and usd 900 mm for the solar power plant   the use of underground reservoirs has been investigated  recent examples include the proposed summit project in norton  ohio  the proposed maysville project in kentucky  underground limestone mine   and the mount hope project in new jersey  which was to have used a former iron mine as the lower reservoir  several new underground pumped storage projects have been proposed  cost-per-kilowatt estimates for these projects can be lower than for surface projects if they use existing underground mine space  there are limited opportunities involving suitable underground space  but the number of underground pumped storage opportunities may increase if abandoned coal mines prove suitable   small pumped-storage hydropower plants can be built on streams and within infrastructures  such as drinking water networks 39  and artificial snow making infrastructures  such plants provide distributed energy storage and distributed flexible electricity production and can contribute to the decentralized integration of intermittent renewable energy technologies  such as wind power and solar power  reservoirs that can be used for small pumped-storage hydropower plants could include 40  natural or artificial lakes  reservoirs within other structures such as irrigation  or unused portions of mines or underground military installations  in switzerland one study suggested that the total installed capacity of small pumped-storage hydropower plants in 2011 could be increased by 3 to 9 times by providing adequate policy instruments  40   in march 2017 the research project stensea  storing energy at sea  announced their successful completion of a four week test of a pumped storage underwater reservoir  in this configuration a hollow sphere submerged in deep water acts as the lower reservoir while the upper reservoir is the enclosing body of water  when a reversible turbine integrated into the sphere uses surplus electricity to pump water out of the sphere the force of the pump must act on the entire column of water above the sphere  so the deeper the sphere is located  the more potential energy it can store and convert back to electricity by letting water back in via the turbine   as such the energy storage capacity of the submerged reservoir is not governed by the gravitational energy in the traditional sense  but rather by the vertical pressure variation   while stensea s test took place at a depth of 100\xa0m in the fresh water lake constance  the technology is foreseen to be used in salt water at greater depths  since the submerged reservoir needs only a connecting electrical cable  the depth at which it can be employed is limited only by the depth at which the turbine can function  currently limited to 700\xa0m  the challenge of designing salt water pumped storage in this underwater configuration brings a range of advantages   a current commercial design featuring a sphere with an inner diameter of 30\xa0m submerged to 700\xa0m would correspond to a 20\xa0mwh capacity which with a 5\xa0mw turbine would lead to a 4 hour discharge time  an energy park with multiple such reservoirs would bring the storage cost to around a few eurocents per kwh with construction and equipment costs in the range 1200-1400 \u20ac per kw  to avoid excessive transmission cost and loss  the reservoirs should be placed off deep water coasts of densely populated areas  such as norway  spain  usa and japan  with this limitation the concept would allow for worldwide electricity storage of close to 900\xa0gwh  41][42   for comparison  a traditional  gravity-based pumped storage capable of storing 20\xa0mwh in a water reservoir the size of a 30\xa0m sphere would need a hydraulic head of 519\xa0m with the elevation spanned by a pressurized water pipe requiring typically a hill or mountain for support
