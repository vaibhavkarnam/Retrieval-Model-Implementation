Tragedyofthecommons
 the tragedy of the commons is an economic theory of a situation within a shared-resource system where individual users acting independently according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling that resource through their collective action  the concept and name originate in an essay written in 1833 by the victorian economist william forster lloyd  who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land  then colloquially called  the commons   in the british isles  1  the concept became widely known over a century later due to an article written by the ecologist garrett hardin in 1968.[2  in this context  commons is taken to mean any shared and unregulated resource such as atmosphere  oceans  rivers  fish stocks  or even an office refrigerator   it has been argued that the very term  tragedy of the commons  is a misnomer per se  since  the commons  originally referred to a resource owned by a community  and no individual outside the community had any access to the resource  however  the term is presently used when describing a problem where all individuals have equal and open access to a resource  hence   tragedy of open access regimes  or simply  the open access problem  are more apt terms  3]:171  the tragedy of the commons is often cited in connection with sustainable development  meshing economic growth and environmental protection  as well as in the debate over global warming  it has also been used in analyzing behavior in the fields of economics  evolutionary psychology  anthropology  game theory  politics  taxation and sociology   although commons have been known to collapse due to overuse  such as in over-fishing   abundant examples exist where communities cooperate or regulate to exploit common resources prudently without collapse  according to the political economist elinor ostrom  although it is often claimed that only private ownership or government regulation can prevent the  tragedy of the commons   prudent users of a commons have a natural incentive to voluntarily cooperate in self-regulation  and history exhibits many examples of complex social schemes to sustain common resources efficiently  4][5       in 1833  the english economist william forster lloyd published a pamphlet which included a hypothetical example of over-use of a common resource  this was the situation of cattle herders sharing a common parcel of land on which they are each entitled to let their cows graze  as was the custom in english villages  he postulated that if a herder put more than his allotted number of cattle on the common  overgrazing could result  for each additional animal  a herder could receive additional benefits  but the whole group shared damage to the commons  if all herders made this individually rational economic decision  the common could be depleted or even destroyed  to the detriment of all  6   in 1968  ecologist garrett hardin explored this social dilemma in his article  the tragedy of the commons   published in the journal science  2][7  the essay derived its title from the pamphlet by lloyd  which he cites  on the over-grazing of common land   hardin discussed problems that cannot be solved by technical means  as distinct from those with solutions that require  a change only in the techniques of the natural sciences  demanding little or nothing in the way of change in human values or ideas of morality   hardin focused on human population growth  the use of the earth s natural resources  and the welfare state  8  hardin argued that if individuals relied on themselves alone  and not on the relationship of society and man  then the number of children had by each family would not be of public concern  parents breeding excessively would leave fewer descendants because they would be unable to provide for each child adequately  such negative feedback is found in the animal kingdom  8  hardin said that if the children of improvident parents starved to death  if overbreeding was its own punishment  then there would be no public interest in controlling the breeding of families  8  hardin blamed the welfare state for allowing the tragedy of the commons  where the state provides for children and supports overbreeding as a fundamental human right  malthusian catastrophe is inevitable  consequently  in his article  hardin lamented the following proposal from the united nations   the universal declaration of human rights describes the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society   article 16[9   it follows that any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself  and cannot be made by anyone else   in addition  hardin also pointed out the problem of individuals acting in rational self-interest by claiming that if all members in a group used common resources for their own gain and with no regard for others  all resources would still eventually be depleted  overall  hardin argued against relying on conscience as a means of policing commons  suggesting that this favors selfish individuals xa0\u2013 often known as free riders xa0\u2013 over those who are more altruistic   in the context of avoiding over-exploitation of common resources  hardin concluded by restating hegel s maxim  which was quoted by engels    freedom is the recognition of necessity   he suggested that  freedom  completes the tragedy of the commons  by recognizing resources as commons in the first place  and by recognizing that  as such  they require management  hardin believed that humans  can preserve and nurture other and more precious freedoms    hardin s article was the start of the modern use of  commons  as a term connoting a shared resource  as frank van laerhoven  amp  elinor ostrom have stated   prior to the publication of hardin u2019s article on the tragedy of the commons (1968   titles containing the words  the commons    common pool resources   or  common property  were very rare in the academic literature   they go on to say   in 2002  barrett and mabry conducted a major survey of biologists to determine which publications in the twentieth century had become classic books or benchmark publications in biology  they report that hardin u2019s 1968 article was the one having the greatest career impact on biologists and is the most frequently cited   11   like lloyd and thomas malthus before him  hardin was primarily interested in the problem of human population growth  but in his essay  he also focused on the use of larger  though finite  resources such as the earth s atmosphere and oceans  as well as pointing out the  negative commons  of pollution  i e   instead of dealing with the deliberate privatization of a positive resource  a  negative commons  deals with the deliberate commonization of a negative cost  pollution    as a metaphor  the tragedy of the commons should not be taken too literally  the  tragedy  is not in the word s conventional or theatric sense  nor a condemnation of the processes that lead to it  similarly  hardin s use of  commons  has frequently been misunderstood  leading him to later remark that he should have titled his work  the tragedy of the unregulated commons   12][13   the metaphor illustrates the argument that free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through over-exploitation  temporarily or permanently  this occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups  each of whom is motivated to maximize use of the resource to the point in which they become reliant on it  while the costs of the exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available  which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it   this  in turn  causes demand for the resource to increase  which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses  even if it retains a capacity to recover   the rate at which depletion of the resource is realized depends primarily on three factors  the number of users wanting to consume the common in question  the consumptiveness of their uses  and the relative robustness of the common  14   the same concept is sometimes called the  tragedy of the fishers   because fishing too many fish before or during breeding could cause stocks to plummet  15   the tragedy of the commons can be considered in relation to environmental issues such as sustainability  the commons dilemma stands as a model for a great variety of resource problems in society today  such as water  forests  16  fish  and non-renewable energy sources such as oil and coal   situations exemplifying the  tragedy of the commons  include the overfishing and destruction of the grand banks  the destruction of salmon runs on rivers that have been dammed \u2013 most prominently in modern times on the columbia river in the northwest united states  and historically in north atlantic rivers \u2013 the devastation of the sturgeon fishery \u2013 in modern russia  but historically in the united states as well \u2013 and  in terms of water supply  the limited water available in arid regions  e g   the area of the aral sea  and the los angeles water system supply  especially at mono lake and owens lake   in economics  an externality is a cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit  negative externalities are a well-known feature of the  tragedy of the commons   for example  driving cars has many negative externalities  these include pollution  carbon emissions  and traffic accidents  every time  person a  gets in a car  it becomes more likely that  person z  xa0\u2013 and millions of others xa0\u2013 will suffer in each of those areas  17  economists often urge the government to adopt policies that  internalize  an externality  18   more general examples  some alluded to by hardin  of potential and actual tragedies include   a parallel was drawn recently between the tragedy of the commons and the competing behaviour of parasites that through acting selfishly eventually diminish or destroy their common host  26  the idea has also been applied to areas such as the evolution of virulence or sexual conflict  where males may fatally harm females when competing for matings  27  it is also raised as a question in studies of social insects  where scientists wish to understand why insect workers do not undermine the  common good  by laying eggs of their own and causing a breakdown of the society   the idea of evolutionary suicide  where adaptation at the level of the individual causes the whole species or population to be driven extinct  can be seen as an extreme form of an evolutionary tragedy of the commons  28][29  from an evolutionary point of view  the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may provide us with advanced therapeutic methods  30    the commons dilemma is a specific class of social dilemma in which people s short-term selfish interests are at odds with long-term group interests and the common good  31  in academia  a range of related terminology has also been used as shorthand for the theory or aspects of it  including resource dilemma  take-some dilemma  and common pool resource   commons dilemma researchers have studied conditions under which groups and communities are likely to under- or over-harvest common resources in both the laboratory and field  research programs have concentrated on a number of motivational  strategic  and structural factors that might be conducive to management of commons   in game theory  which constructs mathematical models for individuals  behavior in strategic situations  the corresponding  game   developed by hardin  is known as the commonize costs xa0\u2013 privatize profits game (cc u2013pp game    kopelman  weber   amp  messick (2002   in a review of the experimental research on cooperation in commons dilemmas  identify nine classes of independent variables that influence cooperation in commons dilemmas  social motives  gender  payoff structure  uncertainty  power and status  group size  communication  causes  and frames  they organize these classes and distinguish between psychological individual differences  stable personality traits  and situational factors  the environment   situational factors include both the task  social and decision structure  and the perception of the task  32   empirical findings support the theoretical argument that the cultural group is a critical factor that needs to be studied in the context of situational variables  33  rather than behaving in line with economic incentives  people are likely to approach the decision to cooperate with an appropriateness framework  34  an expanded  four factor model of the logic of appropriateness  35][36  suggests that the cooperation is better explained by the question   what does a person like me  identity  do  rules  in a situation like this  recognition  given this culture  group     strategic factors also matter in commons dilemmas  one often-studied strategic factor is the order in which people take harvests from the resource  in simultaneous play  all people harvest at the same time  whereas in sequential play people harvest from the pool according to a predetermined sequence xa0\u2013 first  second  third  etc  there is a clear order effect in the latter games  the harvests of those who come first xa0\u2013 the leaders xa0\u2013 are higher than the harvest of those coming later xa0\u2013 the followers  the interpretation of this effect is that the first players feel entitled to take more  with sequential play  individuals adopt a first come-first served rule  whereas with simultaneous play people may adopt an equality rule  another strategic factor is the ability to build up reputations  research by whom   found that people take less from the common pool in public situations than in anonymous private situations  moreover  those who harvest less gain greater prestige and influence within their group   much research has focused on when and why people would like to structurally rearrange the commons to prevent a tragedy  hardin stated in his analysis of the tragedy of the commons that  freedom in a commons brings ruin to all   37  one of the proposed solutions is to appoint a leader to regulate access to the common  groups are more likely to endorse a leader when a common resource is being depleted and when managing a common resource is perceived as a difficult task  groups prefer leaders who are elected  democratic  and prototypical of the group  and these leader types are more successful in enforcing cooperation  a general aversion to autocratic leadership exists  although it may be an effective solution  possibly because of the fear of power abuse and corruption   the provision of rewards and punishments may also be effective in preserving common resources  selective punishments for overuse can be effective in promoting domestic water and energy conservation xa0\u2013 for example  through installing water and electricity meters in houses  selective rewards work  provided that they are open to everyone  an experimental carpool lane in the netherlands failed because car commuters did not feel they were able to organize a carpool  38  the rewards do not have to be tangible  in canada  utilities considered putting  smiley faces  on electricity bills of customers below the average consumption of that customer s neighborhood  39   articulating solutions to the tragedy of the commons is one of the main problems of political philosophy  in many situations  locals implement  often complex  social schemes that work well  the best governmental solution may be to do nothing  when these fail  there are many possible governmental solutions such as privatization  internalizing the externalities  and regulation   sometimes the best governmental solution may be to do nothing  robert axelrod contends that even self-interested individuals will often find ways to cooperate  because collective restraint serves both the collective and individual interests  40  anthropologist g  n  appell criticized those who cited hardin to  impos e  their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge   41   political scientist elinor ostrom  who was awarded 2009 s nobel memorial prize in economic sciences for her work on the issue  and others revisited hardin s work in 1999.[42  they found the tragedy of the commons not as prevalent or as difficult to solve as hardin maintained  since locals have often come up with solutions to the commons problem themselves  43  for example  it was found that a commons in the swiss alps has been run by a collective of farmers there to their mutual and individual benefit since 1517  in spite of the farmers also having access to their own farmland  in general  it is in the users of a commons interests to keep the common running and complex social schemes are often invented by the users for maintaining them at optimum efficiency  4][5   similarly  geographer douglas l  johnson remarks that many nomadic pastoralist societies of africa and the middle east in fact  balanced local stocking ratios against seasonal rangeland conditions in ways that were ecologically sound   reflecting a desire for lower risk rather than higher profit  in spite of this  it was often the case that  the nomad was blamed for problems that were not of his own making and were a product of alien forces   44  independently finding precedent in the opinions of previous scholars such as ibn khaldun as well as common currency in antagonistic cultural attitudes towards non-sedentary peoples  44  governments and international organizations have made use of hardin s work to help justify restrictions on land access and the eventual sedentarization of pastoral nomads despite its weak empirical basis  examining relations between historically nomadic bedouin arabs and the syrian state in the 20th century  dawn chatty notes that  hardin s argument       was curiously accepted as the fundamental explanation for the degradation of the steppe land  in development schemes for the arid interior of the country  downplaying the larger role of agricultural overexploitation in desertification as it melded with prevailing nationalist ideology which viewed nomads as socially backward and economically harmful  45   elinor ostrom  and her colleagues looked at how real-world communities manage communal resources  such as fisheries  land irrigation systems  and farmlands  and they identified a number of factors conducive to successful resource management  one factor is the resource itself  resources with definable boundaries  e g   land  can be preserved much more easily  a second factor is resource dependence  there must be a perceptible threat of resource depletion  and it must be difficult to find substitutes  the third is the presence of a community  small and stable populations with a thick social network and social norms promoting conservation do better  4  a final condition is that there be appropriate community-based rules and procedures in place with built-in incentives for responsible use and punishments for overuse  when the commons is taken over by non-locals  those solutions can no longer be used  43   governmental solutions may be necessary when the above conditions are not met  such as a community being too big or too unstable to provide a thick social network   examples of government regulation include privatization  internalizing the externalities  and regulation   one solution for some resources is to convert common good into private property  giving the new owner an incentive to enforce its sustainability  libertarians and classical liberals cite the tragedy of the commons as an example of what happens when lockean property rights to homestead resources are prohibited by a government  46  they argue that the solution to the tragedy of the commons is to allow individuals to take over the property rights of a resource  that is  to privatize it  47   in a typical example  governmental regulations can limit the amount of a common good that is available for use by any individual  permit systems for extractive economic activities including mining  fishing  hunting  livestock raising and timber extraction are examples of this approach  similarly  limits to pollution are examples of governmental intervention on behalf of the commons  this idea is used by the united nations moon treaty  outer space treaty and law of the sea treaty as well as the unesco world heritage convention which involves the international law principle that designates some areas or resources the common heritage of mankind  48   in hardin s essay  he proposed that the solution to the problem of overpopulation must be based on  mutual coercion  mutually agreed upon  and result in  relinquishing the freedom to breed   hardin discussed this topic further in a 1979 book  managing the commons  co-written with john a  baden  49  he framed this prescription in terms of needing to restrict the  reproductive right   to safeguard all other rights  several countries have a variety of population control laws in place   german historian joachim radkau thought hardin advocates strict management of common goods via increased government involvement or international regulation bodies  50  an asserted impending  tragedy of the commons  is frequently warned of as a consequence of the adoption of policies which restrict private property and espouse expansion of public property  51][52   privatization works when the person who owns the property  or rights of access to that property  pays the full price of its exploitation  as discussed above negative externalities  negative results  such as air or water pollution  that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource  is often a feature driving the tragedy of the commons  internalizing the externalities  in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use  can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation  one example is gasoline taxes which include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution  this solution can provide the flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed   in certain cases  exploiting a resource more may be a good thing  carol m  rose  in an 1986 article  discussed the concept of the  comedy of the commons   where the public property in question exhibits  increasing returns to scale  in usage   the more the merrier   hence the term   in that the more people use the resource  the higher the benefit to each one  rose cites as examples commerce and group recreational activities  according to rose  public resources with the  comedic  characteristic may suffer from under-investment rather than over usage  53   the environmentalist derrick jensen claims the tragedy of the commons is used as propaganda for private ownership  54  he says it has been used by the political right wing to hasten the final enclosure of the  common resources  of third world and indigenous people worldwide  as a part of the washington consensus  he argues that in true situations  those who abuse the commons would have been warned to desist and if they failed would have punitive sanctions against them  he says that rather than being called  the tragedy of the commons   it should be called  the tragedy of the failure of the commons    hardin s work was also criticised 55  as historically inaccurate in failing to account for the demographic transition  and for failing to distinguish between common property and open access resources  56  in a similar vein  carl dahlman argues that commons were effectively managed to prevent overgrazing  57  likewise  susan jane buck cox argues that the common land example used to argue this economic concept is on very weak historical ground  and misrepresents what she terms was actually the  triumph of the commons   the successful common usage of land for many centuries  she argues that social changes and agricultural innovation  and not the behaviour of the commoners  led to the demise of the commons  58   some authors  like yochai benkler  say that with the rise of the internet and digitalisation  an economics system based on commons becomes possible again  he wrote in his book the wealth of networks in 2006 that cheap computing power plus networks enable people to produce valuable products through non-commercial processes of interaction   as human beings and as social beings  rather than as market actors through the price system   he uses the term  networked information economy  to describe a  system of production  distribution  and consumption of information goods characterized by decentralized individual action carried out through widely distributed  nonmarket means that do not depend on market strategies   59  he also coined the term  commons-based peer production  to describe collaborative efforts based on sharing information  60  examples of commons-based peer production are free and open source software and open-source hardware
