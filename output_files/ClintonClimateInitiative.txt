clinton presidential center in little rock  arkansas  1   bill founded the william j  clinton foundation in 2001 following the completion of his presidency  11  longtime clinton advisor bruce lindsey became the ceo in 2004.[12][13  later  lindsey moved from being ceo to being chair  largely for health reasons  12  other clinton hands who played an important early role included doug band 14  and ira magaziner  additional clinton associates who have had senior positions at the foundation include john podesta and laura graham  11   most of the foundation s successes came from bill s worldwide fame and his ability to bring together corporate executives  celebrities  and government officials  11  similarly  the foundation areas of involvement have often corresponded to whatever bill suddenly felt an interest in  11   preceding barack obama s 2009 nomination of hillary clinton as u s  secretary of state  bill clinton agreed to accept a number of conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the clinton presidential center and the clinton global initiative  15  accordingly  a list of donors was released in december 2008.[16   by 2011  chelsea clinton was taking a dominant role in the foundation and had a seat on its board  11][17  to raise money for the foundation  she gave paid speeches  such as her $65,000 2014 address at the university of missouri in kansas city for the opening of the starr women s hall of fame  18   in 2013  hillary clinton joined the foundation following her tenure as secretary of state  she planned to focus her work on issues regarding women and children  19][20  as well as economic development  12  accordingly  at that point  it was renamed the  bill  hillary  amp  chelsea clinton foundation   11  extra attention was paid to the foundation due to the 2016 united states presidential election  11][12   in july 2013  eric braverman was named ceo of the foundation  13  he is a friend and former colleague of chelsea clinton from mckinsey  amp  company  11][12  at the same time  chelsea clinton was named vice chair of the foundation s board  11][13  the foundation was also in the midst of a move to two floors of the time-life building in midtown manhattan  11   chelsea clinton moved the organization to an outside review  conducted by the firm of simpson thacher  amp  bartlett  its conclusions were made public in mid-2013.[12  the main focus was to determine how the foundation could achieve firm financial footing that was not dependent upon the former president s fundraising abilities  how it could operate more like a permanent entity rather than a start-up organization  and thus how it could survive and prosper beyond bill clinton s lifetime  11][12  dennis cheng  a former hillary clinton campaign official and state department deputy chief  was named to oversee a $250 million endowment drive  11  the review also found the management and structure of the foundation needed improvements  including an increase in the size of its board of directors that would have a more direct involvement in planning and budget activities  12  additionally  the review said that all employees needed to understand the foundation s conflict of interest policies and that expense reports needed a more formal review process  12   in january 2015  braverman announced his resignation  politico attributed the move to being  partly from a power struggle inside the foundation between and among the coterie of clinton loyalists who have surrounded the former president for decades and who helped start and run the foundation   21  he was succeeded at first in an acting capacity by former deputy assistant secretary  maura pally  22   on february 18  2015  the washington post reported that   the

as bad for labor rights   63][64][65][66   in november 2012  bill clinton announced the launch of the clinton health matters initiative  chmi   chmi is a national initiative  building on the clinton

the project released a report in march 2015.[72   in march  2015  the charity watchdog group charity navigator added the clinton foundation to a watch list  a designation meant to warn donors that questions have been raised about an entity s practices   after several news organizations raised questions over donations from corporations and foreign governments  it removed the foundation from its watch list in late december of that year  73  in september 2016  it gave it its highest possible rating  four out of four stars  after its customary review of the foundation s financial records and tax statements  74  a different charity monitor  charitywatch  said that 88  of the foundation s money goes toward its charitable mission and gave the foundation an a rating for 2016  in 2015  based on revenue of $223 million and an expense ratio of 12  the foundation spent in excess of $26 million to complete its mission  75   around 2007  the clinton foundation was criticized for a lack of transparency  although u s  law did not require nonprofit charities \u2014 including presidential foundations \u2014 to disclose the identities of their contributors  critics said that the names of donors should be disclosed because hillary was running to be the democratic nominee for president of the united states  commentator matthew yglesias wrote in a los angeles times op-ed that the clintons should make public the names of foundation donors to avoid any appearance of impropriety  76   a lengthy donors list was then released by the foundation in december 2008,[16  which included several politically sensitive donors  such as the kingdom of saudi arabia and blackwater worldwide  77  the foundation stated that the disclosures would ensure that  not even the appearance of a conflict of interest  would exist once hillary clinton was secretary of state  77   in november 2016  the reuters reported that  the clinton foundation has confirmed it accepted a $1 million gift from qatar while hillary clinton was u s  secretary of state without informing the state department  even though she had promised to let the agency review new or significantly increased support from foreign governments   78  conservative columnist jennifer rubin opined that the qatari gift  raised ethical questions  because of the nation s support for hamas  79   the ethics agreement between the state department and the clinton foundation that was put into force at the beginning of the secretary of state clinton s tenure came under scrutiny from the news media during february 2015  a wall street journal report found that the clinton foundation had resumed accepting donations from foreign governments once secretary clinton s tenure had ended  80  contributions from foreign donors who are prohibited by law from contributing to political candidates in the u s  constitute a major portion of the foundation s income  a washington post investigation in 2014 showed that there was  substantial overlap between the clinton political machinery and the foundation   the investigation revealed that almost half of all donors who had backed ready for hillary  a group which supported her 2016 presidency bid  had given at least $10,000 to the foundation  either personally or through their companies  the foundation s chief communications officer craig minassian explained that it is a  false choice to suggest that people who may be interested in supporting political causes wouldn u2019t also support philanthropic work   5   a a subsequent washington post inquiry into donations by foreign governments to the clinton foundation during the secretary s tenure found six cases where such governments continued making donations at the same level they had before clinton became secretary  which was permissible under the agreement  but also one instance of a new donation  $500,000 from algeria for earthquake relief in haiti  that was outside the bounds of the continuation provision and should have received a special ethics review  but did not  81  foundation officials said that if the former secretary decided to run for president in 2016  they would again consider what steps to take in reference to foreign donations  81  but in general  they stressed that   as with other global charities  we rely on the support of individuals  organizations  corporations and governments who have the shared goal of addressing critical global challenges in a meaningful way  when anyone contributes to the clinton foundation  it goes towards foundation programs that help save lives   81  state department spokesperson jen psaki attested that the foundation s commitment to the ethics agreement in question  has been over and above the letter of the law   82  in august 2016  with less than 90 days before the upcoming presidential election  the clinton foundation announced that it will stop accepting foreign donations if clinton is elected  83   in march 2015  reuters reported that the clinton health access initiative had failed to publish all of its donors  and to let the state department review all of its donations from foreign governments after it was spun out of the clinton foundation in 2010.[84  in april 2015  the new york times reported that when hillary clinton was secretary of state  the state department had approved a deal to sell american uranium to a russian state-owned enterprise uranium one whose chairman had donated to the clinton foundation  and that clinton had failed to disclose such donations  85  the state department  was one of nine government agencies  not to mention independent federal and state nuclear regulators  that had to sign off on the deal   86  factcheck org notes that there is  no evidence  that the donations influenced clinton u2019s official actions or that she was involved in the state department s decision to approve the deal  87  and politifact concluded that any  suggestion of a quid pro quo is unsubstantiated   86   in february 2016  the washington post reported that the united states department of state issued a subpoena to the foundation in the fall of 2015  according to the report  the subpoena focused on  documents about the charity s projects that may have required approval from federal government during hillary clinton s term as secretary of state  and  also asked for records related to huma abedin  longtime clinton aide who for six months in 2012 was employed simultaneously by the state department  the foundation  clinton s personal office  and a private consulting firm with ties to the clintons   88   the clinton foundation is a public organization to which anyone may donate  due to their similar names  the public foundation has sometimes been confused with the clinton family foundation  which is reserved for the clintons  private philanthropy  the two foundations have sometimes been conflated by news sources  8  the significantly smaller clinton family foundation is a traditional private foundation that serves as the vehicle for their personal charitable giving  9  headquartered in chappaqua  new york  it received nearly all of the approximately $14 million the clintons gave to charity from 2007\u201313.[8
