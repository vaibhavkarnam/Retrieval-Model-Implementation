Naturalresourcemanagement
 natural resource management refers to the management of natural resources such as land  water  soil  plants and animals  with a particular focus on how management affects the quality of life for both present and future generations  stewardship    natural resource management deals with managing the way in which people and natural landscapes interact  it brings together land use planning  water management  biodiversity conservation  and the future sustainability of industries like agriculture  mining  tourism  fisheries and forestry  it recognises that people and their livelihoods rely on the health and productivity of our landscapes  and their actions as stewards of the land play a critical role in maintaining this health and productivity  1   natural resource management specifically focuses on a scientific and technical understanding of resources and ecology and the life-supporting capacity of those resources  2  environmental management is also similar to natural resource management  in academic contexts  the sociology of natural resources is closely related to  but distinct from  natural resource management       the emphasis on sustainability can be traced back to early attempts to understand the ecological nature of north american rangelands in the late 19th century  and the resource conservation movement of the same time  3][4  this type of analysis coalesced in the 20th century with recognition that preservationist conservation strategies had not been effective in halting the decline of natural resources  a more integrated approach was implemented recognising the intertwined social  cultural  economic and political aspects of resource management  5  a more holistic  national and even global form evolved  from the brundtland commission and the advocacy of sustainable development   in 2005 the government of new south wales  established a standard for quality natural resource management  6  to improve the consistency of practice  based on an adaptive management approach   in the united states  the most active areas of natural resource management are wildlife management often associated with ecotourism and rangeland management  in australia  water sharing  such as the murray darling basin plan and catchment management are also significant   natural resource management approaches can be categorised according to the kind and right of stakeholders  natural resources   stakeholder analysis originated from business management practices and has been incorporated into natural resource management in ever growing popularity  stakeholder analysis in the context of natural resource management identifies distinctive interest groups affected in the utilisation and conservation of natural resources  8   there is no definitive definition of a stakeholder as illustrated in the table below  especially in natural resource management as it is difficult to determine who has a stake and this will differ according to each potential stakeholder  9   different approaches to who is a stakeholder  9   management  management  management  therefore  it is dependent upon the circumstances of the stakeholders involved with natural resource as to which definition and subsequent theory is utilised   billgrena and holme 9  identified the aims of stakeholder analysis in natural resource management   this gives transparency and clarity to policy making allowing stakeholders to recognise conflicts of interest and facilitate resolutions  9][17  there are numerous stakeholder theories such as mitchell et al  18  however grimble 17  created a framework of stages for a stakeholder analysis in natural resource management  grimble 17  designed this framework to ensure that the analysis is specific to the essential aspects of natural resource management   stages in stakeholder analysis  17   application   grimble and wellard 13  established that stakeholder analysis in natural resource management is most relevant where issued can be characterised as   case studies   in the case of the bwindi impenetrable national park  a comprehensive stakeholder analysis would have been relevant and the batwa people would have potentially been acknowledged as stakeholders preventing the loss of people s livelihoods and loss of life  13][17   nepal  indonesia and koreas  community forestry are successful examples of how stakeholder analysis can be incorporated into the management of natural resources  this allowed the stakeholders to identify their needs and level of involvement with the forests   criticisms   alternatives  complementary forms of analysis   natural resource management issues are inherently complex they involve the ecological cycles  hydrological cycles  climate  animals  plants and geographetc  all these are dynamic and inter-related  a change in one of them may have far reaching and or long term impacts which may even be irreversible  in addition to the natural systems  natural resource management also has to manage various stakeholders and their interests  policies  politics  geographical boundaries  economic implications and the list goes on  it is very difficult to satisfy all aspects at the same time  this results in conflicting situations   after the united nations conference for the environment and development  unced  held in rio de janeiro in 1992  most nations subscribed to new principles for the integrated management of land  water  and forests  although program names vary from nation to nation  all express similar aims   the various approaches applied to natural resource management include   the community-based natural resource management  cbnrm  approach combines conservation objectives with the generation of economic benefits for rural communities  the three key assumptions being that  locals are better placed to conserve natural resources  people will conserve a resource only if benefits exceed the costs of conservation  and people will conserve a resource that is linked directly to their quality of life  5  when a local people s quality of life is enhanced  their efforts and commitment to ensure the future well-being of the resource are also enhanced  22  regional and community based natural resource management is also based on the principle of subsidiarity   the united nations advocates cbnrm in the convention on biodiversity and the convention to combat desertification  unless clearly defined  decentralised nrm can result an ambiguous socio-legal environment with local communities racing to exploit natural resources while they can e g  forest communities in central kalimantan (indonesia   23   a problem of cbnrm is the difficulty of reconciling and harmonising the objectives of socioeconomic development  biodiversity protection and sustainable resource utilisation  24  the concept and conflicting interests of cbnrm  25][26  show how the motives behind the participation are differentiated as either people-centred  active or participatory results that are truly empowering  27  or planner-centred  nominal and results in passive recipients   understanding power relations is crucial to the success of community based nrm  locals may be reluctant to challenge government recommendations for fear of losing promised benefits   cbnrm is based particularly on advocacy by nongovernmental organizations working with local groups and communities  on the one hand  and national and transnational organizations  on the other  to build and extend new versions of environmental and social advocacy that link social justice and environmental management agendas 28  with both direct and indirect benefits observed including a share of revenues  employment  diversification of livelihoods and increased pride and identity  cbnrm has raised new challenges  as concepts of community  territory  conservation  and indigenous are worked into politically varied plans and programs in disparate sites  warner and jones 29  address strategies for effectively managing conflict in cbnrm   the capacity of indigenous communities to conserve natural resources has been acknowledged by the australian government with the caring for country 30  program  caring for our country is an australian government initiative jointly administered by the australian government department of agriculture  fisheries and forestry and the department of the environment  water  heritage and the arts  these departments share responsibility for delivery of the australian government s environment and sustainable agriculture programs  which have traditionally been broadly referred to under the banner of \u2018natural resource management u2019   these programs have been delivered regionally  through 56 state government bodies  successfully allowing regional communities to decide the natural resource priorities for their regions  31   governance is seen as a key consideration for delivering community-based or regional natural resource management  in the state of nsw  the 13 catchment management authorities  cmas  are overseen by the natural resources commission  nrc   responsible for undertaking audits of the effectiveness of regional natural resource management programs  32   the primary methodological approach adopted by catchment management authorities  cmas  for regional natural resource management in australia is adaptive management  6   this approach includes recognition that adaption occurs through a process of \u2018plan-do-review-act u2019  it also recognises seven key components that should be considered for quality natural resource management practice   integrated natural resource management  inrm  is a process of managing natural resources in a systematic way  which includes multiple aspects of natural resource use  biophysical  socio-political  and economic  meet production goals of producers and other direct users  e g   food security  profitability  risk aversion  as well as goals of the wider community  e g   poverty alleviation  welfare of future generations  environmental conservation   it focuses on sustainability and at the same time tries to incorporate all possible stakeholders from the planning level itself  reducing possible future conflicts  the conceptual basis of inrm has evolved in recent years through the convergence of research in diverse areas such as sustainable land use  participatory planning  integrated watershed management  and adaptive management  33][34][34  inrm is being used extensively and been successful in regional and community based natural management  35   there are various frameworks and computer models developed to assist natural resource management   geographic information systems  gis   gis is a powerful analytical tool as it is capable of overlaying datasets to identify links  a bush regeneration scheme can be informed by the overlay of rainfall  cleared land and erosion  36  in australia  metadata directories such as ndar provide data on australian natural resources such as vegetation  fisheries  soils and water  37  these are limited by the potential for subjective input and data manipulation   natural resources management audit frameworks  the nsw government in australia has published an audit framework 38  for natural resource management  to assist the establishment of a performance audit role in the governance of regional natural resource management  this audit framework builds from other established audit methodologies  including performance audit  environmental audit and internal audit  audits undertaken using this framework have provided confidence to stakeholders  identified areas for improvement and described policy expectations for the general public  39][40   the australian government has established a framework for auditing greenhouse emissions and energy reporting  which closely follows australian standards for assurance engagements   the australian government is also currently preparing an audit framework for auditing water management  focussing on the implementation of the murray darling basin plan   the issue of biodiversity conservation is regarded as an important element in natural resource management  what is biodiversity  biodiversity is a comprehensive concept  which is a description of the extent of natural diversity  gaston and spicer 41  (p  xa03  point out that biodiversity is  the variety of life  and relate to different kinds of  biodiversity organization   according to gray 42  (p  xa0154   the first widespread use of the definition of biodiversity  was put forward by the united nations in 1992  involving different aspects of biological diversity   the  threats  wreaking havoc on biodiversity include  habitat fragmentation  putting a strain on the already stretched biological resources  forest deterioration and deforestation  the invasion of  alien species  and  climate change  43   p  xa02   since these threats have received increasing attention from environmentalists and the public  the precautionary management of biodiversity becomes an important part of natural resources management  according to cooney  there are material measures to carry out precautionary management of biodiversity in natural resource management   cooney claims that the policy making is dependent on  evidences   relating to  high standard of proof   the forbidding of special  activities  and  information and monitoring requirements   before making the policy of precaution  categorical evidence is needed  when the potential menace of  activities  is regarded as a critical and  irreversible  endangerment  these  activities  should be forbidden  for example  since explosives and toxicants will have serious consequences to endanger human and natural environment  the south africa marine living resources act promulgated a series of policies on completely forbidding to  catch fish  by using explosives and toxicants   according to cooney  there are 4 methods to manage the precaution of biodiversity in natural resources management   in order to have a sustainable environment  understanding and using appropriate management strategies is important  in terms of understanding  young 44  emphasises some important points of land management   dale et al  (2000)[45  study has shown that there are five fundamental and helpful ecological principles for the land manager and people who need them  the ecological principles relate to time  place  species  disturbance and the landscape and they interact in many ways it is suggested that land managers could follow these guidelines
