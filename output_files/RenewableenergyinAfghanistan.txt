RenewableenergyinAfghanistan
 renewable energy in afghanistan includes biomass  hydropower  solar  wind power  1  afghanistan is a landlocked country located in asia that holds a spot as one of the countries with a smaller ecological footprint  it has been contended at different levels that hydropower may be an easier source of renewable energy for afghanistan than other nations due to their geographical location  2  their mountainous environment facilitates hydro dams and other facets of hydro energy  yasah et al     the nation however  is not entirely independent on their sources of energy  they import an annual sum from neighboring countries like tajikistan  mainali  amp  silveira   another form of renewable energy that afghanistan has been doing is the implementation of biogas  amjid et al    with the start of biogas  communities have begun to feel the benefits beyond that of the environment through capacity building as well  amjid et al     afghanistan is one of the lowest energy consuming countries in relation to a global standing  mainali  amp  silveira    the country continues to feel the effect of the war  and the hardships it has endured in the name of it continue to leave scars  with \u201clooting and lack of maintenance and spare parts mean that generation capacity is far below the potential level [\u2026  which in turn is sustainability below the country u2019s need u201d  2  afghanistan is not self sustainable with their use of energy  they also have the need to import energy from neighboring countries  one particular country that afghanistan imports from is tajikistan  it is known that \u201cthe three countries also agreed to set up a joint commission to explore possibilities into the transfer of 500 kilo watts of energy from tajikistan to afghanistan and iran u201d  institute for the study of war   importing energy is a popular thing among central asian countries  adding a deeper level of connectedness between governments and citizens  2       annual average solar insolation varies from 4 to 6.5 kwh m2 day  with over 300 days of sunshine per year   traditional biomass energy supplies to 85  of energy demand  such as from wood and dung   biogas can be used in many different countries with the same function and uses  the renewable energy sector in afghanistan is strong though has potential to grow through initiatives like biogas  amjid et al   the  use of biogas produced from anaerobic decomposition of organic material  this biogas typically contains equal amounts of ch4 and co2   barrai et al   p  xa0391   when biogas is converted in the right way  that is when the renewable energy and resource is possible deriving the hydrogen from the waste   amjid et al   biogas \u201cdecompose municipal solid wastes anaerobically [1 and landfill gas to energy projects that directly combust the landfill gas are being implemented u201d  barrai et al   p  xa0391   the strength of biogas is incredible  it has [2 been proven that the \u201cbiogas energy corridor can work as a good substitute for nearly 70  of the country u2019s population residing in rural areas  installation of plants to bottle the biogas can be additional opportunity  the need of a national policy is imperative to bring this technology at farmer u2019s doorstep  u201d  amjid et al   p  xa02833   the renewable energy that this brings is very strong through reducing the carbon footprint of each community immeasurably  amjid et al    the system of biogas also creates immense potential for capacity building through the community connectedness that goes into the process  barrai et al   the teamwork is inevitable that comes from this initiative with begins with an exchange of knowledge  both shared and new  then capacity building can begin to form contributing to resources and market development growing rapidly  amjid et al    advocacy for all parties is the only way for effective participatory renewable energy to be made  borda   the united nations environment program  unep  spoke on the topic when the country program manager of afghanistan had this to say   \u201cunep is pleased to endorse the vision and mission of the biogas consortium afghanistan  the majority of the population of afghanistan uses firewood and coal for their cooking and heating needs  more sustainable energy options are required  [\u2026  unep has committed to providing higher-level guidance  helping the consortium align its activities towards national policies and strategies  unep shall also advocate the benefits and studies that arise from the consortiums work in biogas in afghanistan u201d  borda   afghanistan has significant hydro resources with the river catchment area of 677,900 km2  annual average rainfall of 300 mm and wide spread hilly topography  mainali  amp  silveira  p  xa0300    currently there is a 304 mw installed capacity of electricity generated by hydropower  in which 183 mw are in operation the current system in place in afghanistan though it works well  is not without its flaws  as yasah et al  contend  \u201cthe common strategy is currently to build micro-hydropower facilities to power single bulbs and maybe a water boiler for the whole community  such constructions will not deliver sufficient power for electric ovens etc   grid electricity will not stretch out to the rural areas of afghanistan in the near decades u201d  yasah et al   p  xa051   that being said  hydropower and hydro energy are some of the best options that are currently in place  the geographical location of afghanistan is extremely mountainous which makes the implementation of hydropower an easier choice though not much has been created and implemented yet  2  acknowledging how low afghanistan u2019s ecological footprint is in terms of their energy consumption talking about a worldwide standpoint  it is not a current possibility to have enough energy  global footprint international  mainali  amp  silveira mainali   in fact  \u201cthe country has 75 billion cubic meters of potentially available renewable water resources are also the main source of recharge for groundwater as precipitation is low in afghanistan u201d  2  water has become such a precious commodity across the globe that makes having an abundance of it  as a natural resource is a fortunate reality for afghanistan  2  that being said it is also contended that even though these ideas and proposals for hydro energy would work and have positive effects  the necessary work that is a project such as hydro energy   yasah et al   [2   wind power is not the most commonly used tool in afghanistan for renewable energy though there are vast opportunities  it is contended that the areas which would produce the most wind energy and would benefit the most are in western afghanistan and some areas in the northern region as well  elliott     media related to renewable energy in afghanistan at wikimedia commons
