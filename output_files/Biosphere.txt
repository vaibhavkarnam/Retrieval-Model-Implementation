Biosphere
 the biosphere also known as the ecosphere  is the worldwide sum of all ecosystems  the two joined words are  bio  and  sphere   it can also be termed as the zone of life on earth  a closed system  apart from solar and cosmic radiation and heat from the interior of the earth   and largely self-regulating  1  by the most general biophysiological definition  the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships  including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere  geosphere  hydrosphere  and atmosphere  the biosphere is postulated to have evolved  beginning with a process of biopoiesis  life created naturally from non-living matter  such as simple organic compounds  or biogenesis  life created from living matter   at least some 3.5 billion years ago  2][3  the earliest evidence for life on earth includes biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks from western greenland 4  and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone from western australia  5][6  more recently  in 2015   remains of biotic life  were found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in western australia  7][8  in 2017  putative fossilized microorganisms  or microfossils  were announced to have been discovered in hydrothermal vent precipitates in the nuvvuagittuq belt of quebec  canada that were as old as 4.28 billion years  the oldest record of life on earth  suggesting  an almost instantaneous emergence of life  after ocean formation 4.4 billion years ago  and not long after the formation of the earth 4.54 billion years ago  9][10][11][12  according to one of the researchers   if life arose relatively quickly on earth     then it could be common in the universe   7   in a general sense  biospheres are any closed  self-regulating systems containing ecosystems  this includes artificial biospheres such as biosphere 2 and bios-3  and potentially ones on other planets or moons  13       the term  biosphere  was coined by geologist eduard suess in 1875  which he defined as the place on earth s surface where life dwells  14   while the concept has a geological origin  it is an indication of the effect of both charles darwin and matthew f  maury on the earth sciences  the biosphere s ecological context comes from the 1920s  see vladimir i  vernadsky   preceding the 1935 introduction of the term  ecosystem  by sir arthur tansley  see ecology history   vernadsky defined ecology as the science of the biosphere  it is an interdisciplinary concept for integrating astronomy  geophysics  meteorology  biogeography  evolution  geology  geochemistry  hydrology and  generally speaking  all life and earth sciences   geochemists define the biosphere as being the total sum of living organisms  the  biomass  or  biota  as referred to by biologists and ecologists   in this sense  the biosphere is but one of four separate components of the geochemical model  the other three being geosphere  hydrosphere  and atmosphere  when these four component spheres are combined into one system  it is known as the ecosphere  this term was coined during the 1960s and encompasses both biological and physical components of the planet  15   the second international conference on closed life systems defined biospherics as the science and technology of analogs and models of earth s biosphere  i e   artificial earth-like biospheres  16  others may include the creation of artificial non-earth biospheres u2014for example  human-centered biospheres or a native martian biosphere u2014as part of the topic of biospherics  citation needed   every part of the planet  from the polar ice caps to the equator  features life of some kind  recent advances in microbiology have demonstrated that microbes live deep beneath the earth s terrestrial surface  and that the total mass of microbial life in so-called  uninhabitable zones  may  in biomass  exceed all animal and plant life on the surface  the actual thickness of the biosphere on earth is difficult to measure  birds typically fly at altitudes as high as 1,800\xa0m (5,900\xa0ft  1.1\xa0mi  and fish live as much as 8,372\xa0m (27,467\xa0ft  5.202\xa0mi  underwater in the puerto rico trench  2   there are more extreme examples for life on the planet  r xfcppell s vulture has been found at altitudes of 11,300\xa0m (37,100\xa0ft  7.0\xa0mi   bar-headed geese migrate at altitudes of at least 8,300\xa0m (27,200\xa0ft  5.2\xa0mi   yaks live at elevations as high as 5,400\xa0m (17,700\xa0ft  3.4\xa0mi  above sea level  mountain goats live up to 3,050\xa0m (10,010\xa0ft  1.90\xa0mi   herbivorous animals at these elevations depend on lichens  grasses  and herbs   life forms live in every part of the earth s biosphere  including soil  hot springs  inside rocks at least 19\xa0km (12\xa0mi  deep underground  the deepest parts of the ocean  and at least 64\xa0km (40\xa0mi  high in the atmosphere  17][18][19  microorganisms  under certain test conditions  have been observed to thrive in the vacuum of outer space  20][21  the total amount of soil and subsurface bacterial carbon is estimated as 5 \xd7 1017 g  or the  weight of the united kingdom   17  the mass of prokaryote microorganisms u2014which includes bacteria and archaea  but not the nucleated eukaryote microorganisms u2014may be as much as 0.8 trillion tons of carbon  of the total biosphere mass  estimated at between 1 and 4 trillion tons   22  barophilic marine microbes have been found at more than a depth of 10,000\xa0m (33,000\xa0ft  6.2\xa0mi  in the mariana trench  the deepest spot in the earth s oceans  23  in fact  single-celled life forms have been found in the deepest part of the mariana trench  by the challenger deep  at depths of 11,034\xa0m (36,201\xa0ft  6.856\xa0mi   24][25][26  other researchers reported related studies that microorganisms thrive inside rocks up to 580\xa0m (1,900\xa0ft  0.36\xa0mi  below the sea floor under 2,590\xa0m (8,500\xa0ft  1.61\xa0mi  of ocean off the coast of the northwestern united states  25][27  as well as 2,400\xa0m (7,900\xa0ft  1.5\xa0mi  beneath the seabed off japan  28  culturable thermophilic microbes have been extracted from cores drilled more than 5,000\xa0m (16,000\xa0ft  3.1\xa0mi  into the earth s crust in sweden  29  from rocks between 65\u201375\xa0\xb0c (149\u2013167\xa0\xb0f   temperature increases with increasing depth into the earth s crust  the rate at which the temperature increases depends on many factors  including type of crust  continental vs  oceanic   rock type  geographic location  etc  the greatest known temperature at which microbial life can exist is 122\xa0\xb0c (252\xa0\xb0f   methanopyrus kandleri strain 116   and it is likely that the limit of life in the  deep biosphere  is defined by temperature rather than absolute depth  citation needed  on 20 august 2014  scientists confirmed the existence of microorganisms living 800\xa0m (2,600\xa0ft  0.50\xa0mi  below the ice of antarctica  30][31  according to one researcher   you can find microbes everywhere \u2014 they re extremely adaptable to conditions  and survive wherever they are   25   our biosphere is divided into a number of biomes  inhabited by fairly similar flora and fauna  on land  biomes are separated primarily by latitude  terrestrial biomes lying within the arctic and antarctic circles are relatively barren of plant and animal life  while most of the more populous biomes lie near the equator   for this list  if a word is followed by a number  it is usually referring to a specific system or number  thus   no biospheres have been detected beyond the earth  therefore  the existence of extraterrestrial biospheres remains hypothetical  the rare earth hypothesis suggests they should be very rare  save ones composed of microbial life only  34  on the other hand  earth analogs may be quite numerous  at least in the milky way galaxy  35  three of the planets discovered orbiting trappist-1 could possibly contain biospheres  36  given limited understanding of abiogenesis  it is currently unknown what percentage of these planets actually develop biospheres   it is also possible that artificial biospheres will be created during the future  for example on mars  37  the process of creating an uncontained system that mimics the function of earth s biosphere is called terraforming  38
